// Fannie Likes 2 Dance //

My name is Fannie and I like to dance a lot
I'll take you on the floor and make you real hot
Do think that I'm a bad girl because I like to dance a lot
But you'll still be my baby if I didn't like to dance a lot

My name is Fannie and I like to dance a lot
Alot, alot, alot
I'll take you on the floor and make you real hot
Hot Hot Hot
This the kind of dancing I'm talking about
This the kind of dancing that makes me scream
And shout

It seems like seems like a bad curse
Eveery day gets a little worse
I don't know why I want to dance,
Everytime I get a chance

My name is Fannie and I like to dance a lot
Alot, alot, aLot
I'll take you on the floor and make you real hot
Hot hot hot
This the kind of dancing I'm talking about
This the kind of dancing that makes me scream
And shout

My name is Fannie and I like to dance a lot
I'll take you on the floor and make you real hot

// How It Goes //

Hey! D!
That's how it goes!
[repeats]

// Cariño //

Eres una obra de arte
Con solo mirarte
Allgo que da paz

Cariño eres un amor
Cariño pintas en color

Quiero tanto devorarte
Esta vez besarte
Si es que soy capaz

Cariño eres un amor
Cariño pintas en color

There's something about you babe
There's something about you babe

I can be your babe if you won't let go
You can talk to me, but you already know
I can be your babe if you won't let go

Cariño eres un amor
Cariñito pintas en color

There's something about you babe
There's something about you babe

// Super Rich Kids //

Ohhhh
Ahhhh

// Next To You //

I can feel your shadow
I just wanna be next to you
Wanna be next to you

I can't fight the world's battles
I just wanna be next to you
Wanna be next to you

I don't have any country
I did but it tore me up
And I don't know anymore

And this life is such a mystery
But I don't feel so fucked up
As long as I'm next to you

So many people
Watch how they fall
So many good ones
Can't be who they are
So many people
Are fading away
So many people
Can't make it today

Days go by and I'll never know
I'll never have words to explain what is going on
Guns are pointed at everyone
But together we're better off
I wanna be next to you

So many people
Watch how they fall
So many good ones
Can't be who they are
So many people
Are fading away
So many people
Can't make it today

// Come Back A Different Day //

I've been dreamin' nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin'

Come back a different day
If you wait
Day, night
Sunshine finds you

Different times
Different lives, yeah
Oh now, now
Did you think you could change it?

I don't know, I was just laughin' away
Hidin' there
Come back a different day

Yes, you wanted to feel that
Only moonlight would get in your way
Day, night
Sunshine finds you

Different times
Different lives, yeah
Oh now, now
Did you think you could change it?

I don't know, I was just laughin' away
Hidin' there
Come back a different day

Anyway
Come back a different day

I've been dreamin' nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin'
Come back a different day
Get in your way
I've been dreamin' nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin'

// Live On //

Live on live on live on
Live on live on live on

Cause he lived

When you have a mountain you can't climb
When you have a problem in your way

Just remember his joy divine
And from his path you will not stray

(Living cause he lived)
What he wants me to be
(Living cause he lived)
He gave so I can be free
(Living cause he lived)
To live righteously

Live on live on live on
Live on live on live on
Cause he lived

Treat your neighbor right
Be faithful honest and true
Don't let darkness overcome the light
Cause he led the way for you

(Living cause he lived)
What he wants me to be
(Living cause he lived)
He gave so I can be free
(Living cause he lived)
To live righteously

Live on live on live on
Live on live on live on
Cause he lived

(Living cause he lived)
(Living cause he lived)
(Living cause he lived)

// Masterpiece //

Time don't make it better
I just keep on falling for you
We change like the weather
I just can't keep waiting for you
You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard trying to cope living without you
Please don't change your smile, you're the only one
I love please never die
'Fact, you're gunna be the only for me
I've been sitting down waiting so desperately
Time don't make it better
I just keep on falling for you
We change like the weather
I just can't keep waiting for you
You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard trying to cope breathing without you
I got no fear in me, but it feels stupid trying to make you see
'Cause you got me feeling high like a kite you see
If it don't make sense it ain't meant to be
But tears don't make it better
I just can't keep falling on you
We change like the weather
I just can't keep falling on you
You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard trying to find the key
If I wait any longer my heart will bleed
And spend my whole life in a lucid dream
When my friends tell me that I got a love disease
'Cause I said won't live if I have to do life without you
(All I think about is you...)

// Like Yesterday //

Looking through my phone
Messages that I know I shouldn't send, already sent
We used to be a major chord
You were the third, I the fourth
Stuck in dissonance
Our love a punishment

I've got you crying

And I'm wishing that you would stay
Would you love me one more day?
Like yesterday
And I'm looking inside your brain
To see your mind's already made
From yesterday

Shackled up just friends
Stuck in dreams of when we were again
I can't begin
Sifting through the same songs baby
Looking for the one that makes me think of you, the way I used to do back when I was your fool

And now I'm crying

And I'm wishing that you would stay
Would you love me one more day?
Like yesterday
And I'm looking inside your brain
To see your mind's already made
From yesterday

Lost and so alone, writing songs I know that don't make sense, and have no end...

// Sunday //

Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
Well I found him on Tuesday
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
And I dated him Wednesday
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
And I kissed him on Thursday
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
And he didn't come Friday No
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
And he showed up Saturday
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
