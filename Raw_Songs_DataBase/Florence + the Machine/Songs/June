The show was ending and I had started to crack
Woke up in Chicago and the sky turned black
And you're so high, you're so high, you had to be an angel
And I'm so high, I'm so high, I can see an angel

I hear your heart beating in your chest
The world slows 'till there's nothing left
Skyscrapers look on like great, unblinking giants (oh)

In those heavy days in June
When love became an act of defiance

Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other

You were broken-hearted and the world was, too
And I was beginning to lose my grip
And I always held it loosely
But this time I admit
I felt it really start to slip

And choir singing in the street
And I will come to you
To watch the television screen
In your hotel room

Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other

You're so high, you're so high
You're so high, you're so high
You're so high, you're so high
You had to be an angel
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high
I can see an angel
