Old hope
Got stuck in your throat
Wound its way around your neck
And caused you to choke
Old hope
Made of rope
That held you tight when the chair legs broke

When they found you hanging in the wood
You said at least now I don't have to be kind or good
I'll be cruel and I'll be obscene
Tear out my tongue
Cause I've been redeemed
When they found you hanging in the wood
You said at least now I don't have to be kind or good
I'll be cruel and I'll be obscene
Tear out my tongue
Cause I've been redeemed

Save my blushes for the grave
No shy glance, no coy restraint
And I won't hang my head
And I won't repent
Won't face the wall and count to ten
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

Well they tore you down
And they tore out your tongue
And they made you kneel
For all the things that you'd done
But you wouldn't cry
And you wouldn't beg
You just grinned
And tore out your teeth instead

When they found you hanging in the wood
You said at least now I don't have to be kind or good
I'll be cruel and I'll be obscene
Tear out my tongue
Cause I've been redeemed

I don't have to sit down and behave
Cause my darling I've been saved
