Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the most

When you broke down, I didn't leave ya
I stayed by your side
So where are you now when I need ya?
I need you the most?

I gave you attention when nobody else was playin'
I gave the shirt off my back what you sayin'
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh lord

Where are you now when I need ya?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the most
(When we broke down, I didn't leave ya)
I stayed by your side
So where are you now when I need ya?
I need you the most

I gave you my heart when said yours was broken.
I gave you the keys when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See I gave you faith turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned into moping
Tell me 

Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now?
(Where are you now that I need ya?)
Couldn't find you anywhere
(When you broke down I didn't leave ya)
I was by your side
(When you broke down I didn't leave ya)
Where are you now?

(I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need the most)
I was by your side
Where are you now?
I was by your side
Where are you now?
(I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need the most)

Where are you now that I need ya?
