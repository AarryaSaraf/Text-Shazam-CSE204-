I think you hide
When all the world's asleep and tired
You cry a little, so do I, so do I
I think you hide
And you don't have to tell me why
You cry a little, so do I, so do I

Tell me I will be released
Not sure I can deal with this
Up all night again this week
Breaking things that I should keep

I know that you're hiding
I know there's a part of you that I just cannot reach
You don't have to let me in
Just know that I'm still here
I'm ready for you whenever, whenever you need
Whenever you want to begin

I know you've tried
But something stops you every time
You cry a little, so do I, so do I
And it's your pride
That's keeping us still so far apart
But if you give a little, so will I, so will I

Tell me I will be released
Not sure I can deal with this
Up all night again this week
Breaking things that I should keep

I know that you're hiding
I know there's a part of you that I just cannot reach
You don't have to let me in
Just know that I'm still here
I'm ready for you whenever, whenever you need
Whenever you want to begin

I know I seem shaky
These hands not fit for holding
But if you let me, oh
I will see you right

Tell me I will be released
Not sure I can deal with this
Up all night again this week
Breaking things that I should keep




I know that you're hiding
I know there's a part of you that I just cannot reach
You don't have to let me in

I'm still here
I'm still here
