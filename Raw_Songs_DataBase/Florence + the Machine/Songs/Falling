I've fallen out of favour
And I've fallen from grace
Fallen out of trees
And I've fallen on my face
Fallen out of taxis
Out of windows too
Fell in your opinion
When I fell in love with you

Oh-ooh 

Sometimes I wish for falling
Wish for the release
Wish for falling through the air
To give me some relief
Because falling's not the problem
When I'm falling I'm at peace
It's only when I hit the ground
It causes all the grief

Oh-ooh 

This is a song for a scribbled out name
And my love keeps writing again and again
This is a song for a scribbled out name
And my love keeps writing again and again
And again 


I'll dance myself up
Drunk myself down
Find people to love
Left people to drown
I'm not scared to jump
I'm not scared to fall
If there was nowhere to land
I wouldn't be scared
At all 
Fall 

Sometimes I wish for falling
Wish for the release
Wish for falling through the air
To give me some relief
Because falling's not the problem
When I'm falling I'm at peace
It's only when I hit the ground
It causes all the grief
