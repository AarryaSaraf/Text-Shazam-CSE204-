Now the sun is up and I'm going blind
Another drink just to pass the time
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
Maybe not tonight

It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Till Delilah showed me how

I can never let go
Never knew I was a dancer
I can never let go

'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
But maybe not tonight

And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down

It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Till Delilah showed me how

I can never let go
I can never let go
Never knew I was a dancer
I can never let go
