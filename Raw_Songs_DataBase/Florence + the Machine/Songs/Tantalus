It's a black lake that I'm standing in
It's a shallow pool and I cannot drink or swim
And the fruit trees are draping up above
I can see them but I cannot ever touch

In my heart in my chest like a bomb in a bag
And it's always on the edge of going off
But then you give me just enough

What you want from me
Maybe you don't even know
How you keep me tantalized
Every day, every night
Are you oblivious to my oblivion
You don't even know what you've done
You don't even know what you've done
You keep me dangling like that fruit upon a vine
Oh it was never mine
To keep me tantalized

Do you mean to withhold what I hunger for
Did you just forget and don't think of me at all
And in the garden of the world
I could have my fill
I could rage and ransack, but something holds me still

In my heart in my chest like a bomb in a bag
And it's always on the edge of going off
But then you give me just enough

What you want from me
Maybe you don't even know
How you keep me tantalized
Every day, every night
Are you oblivious to my oblivion
You don't know what you've done
You don't know what you've done
You keep me dangling like that fruit upon a vine
Oh it was never mine
You keep me tantalized

What you want from me
Maybe you don't even know
How you keep me tantalized
Every day, every night
Are you oblivious to my oblivion
You don't know what you've done
You don't know what you've done
You keep me dangling like that fruit upon a vine
It was never mine
You keep me tantalized
