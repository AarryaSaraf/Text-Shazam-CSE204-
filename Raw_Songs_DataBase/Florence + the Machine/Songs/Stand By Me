When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So, darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

And, darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me

Darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me
