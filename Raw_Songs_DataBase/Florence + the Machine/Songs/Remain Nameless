I was born in a big gray cloud
Screaming out a love song
All the broken chords and unnamed cries
What a place to come from

I wish to remain nameless
And live without shame
'Cause what's in a name, Oh
I still remain the same

You can call it what you want
You can call me anything you want
You can call us what you want
You can call me anything you want

Everybody lets you down
In this brief hole of a town
What a difference of the rushing out
Tell me what you're running from

I know everybody lets you down
I'll do the same
But know I'll always be around
This can remain the same

Call me when you need me
Call me anything you want
Darling, believe me
Nothing I haven't done before

Call me when you need me, call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Darling, believe me, darling, believe me
Darling, believe me, darling believe me

Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me

Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me

Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me

Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me

Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me

Darling, believe me, darling believe me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
