Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette
Draw me a circle and I'll protect
Heaven is here if you want it

Oh, bring your boy, bring your bottle
Open your mouth, pour it down his neck
Heaven is here if you want it

And all of the fish, let them flounder
I went to the water, drank every drop
I'll turn your sea to a desert

More catholic taste than the Devil
All gilded and golden, yes, I'm your girl
Hell, if it glitters, I'm going

And I ride in my red dress
And time stretches endless
With my gun in my hand
You know I always get my man

And every song I wrote became an escape rope
Tied around my neck to pull me up to Heaven
