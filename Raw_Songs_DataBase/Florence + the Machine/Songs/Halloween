Well let me tell you a story, now
About a judge, a thief, and a wife and a clown
'Cause on this fine, fine day
One of them goes down

The judge said to the thief, "Boy, it's a fine day for justice,"
And the thief said to the judge, 
"Old man, it's a fine, fine day for love!"

The wife said to the clown,
"My dear, you gotta take the judge down!"
And the clown, the clown
He just smiled

As the clown stood, covered in the judge's blood, he cried, 
"Well I will be a fool no more
I will be a fool no more!"
As he turned and cartwheeled out the door

Now let me tell you something, 
The thief, the thief, and the wife
Well they left that day, left the...
Left the clown covered in the judge's blood alone

The clown frowned as he fell to the ground
It's a fine, fine day for love

It's a fine, fine, fine, fine day for love
A fine, fine day for fools
And I will be a fool no more
Oh, because of you
