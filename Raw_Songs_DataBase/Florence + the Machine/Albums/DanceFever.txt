Album: DanceFever

// King //

We argue in the kitchen about whether to have children
About the world ending and the scale of my ambition
And how much is art really worth?
The very thing you're best at
Is the thing that hurts the most
But you need your rotten heart
Your dazzling pain like diamond rings
You need to go to war to find material to sing

I am no mother
I am no bride
I am king

I need my golden crown of sorrow
My bloody sword to swing
My empty halls to echo with grand self-mythology

I am no mother
I am no bride
I am king

I am no mother
I am no bride
I am king

But a woman is a changeling
Always shifting shape
Just when you think you have it figured out
Something new begins to take
What strange claws are these
Scratching at my skin?
I never knew my killer would be coming from within

I am no mother
I am no bride
I am king

I am no mother
I am no bride
I am king

I need my golden crown of sorrow
My bloody sword to swing
I need my empty halls to echo with grand self-mythology

'Cause I am no mother
I am no bride
I am king

I am no mother
I am no bride
I am king

I am no mother
I am no bride
I am king

I am no mother
I am no bride
I am king

Oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

And I was never as good
As I always thought I was
But I knew how to dress it up
I was never satisfied, it never let me go
Just dragged me by my hair
And back on with the show

// Free //

Sometimes I wonder if I should be medicated
If I would feel better just lightly sedated
The feeling comes so fast and I cannot control it
I'm on fire, but I'm trying not to show it

As it picks me up, puts me down
It picks me up, puts me down
Picks me up, puts me down a hundred times a day
It picks me up, puts me down
Chews me up, spits me out
Picks me up and puts me down

I'm always running from something
I push it back, but it keeps on coming
And being clever never got me very far
Because it's all in my head
"You're too sensitive" they said
I said "Okay, but let's discuss this at the hospital"

Picks me up, puts me down
It picks me up, puts me down
Picks me up, puts me down a hundred times a day
Picks me up, puts me down
Chews me up, spits me out
Picks me up, puts me down

But I hear the music
I feel the beat
And for a moment
When I'm dancing
I am free

I hear the music
I feel the beat
And for a moment
When I'm dancing
I am free
I am free

Is this how it is?
Is this how it's always been?
To exist in the face of suffering and death
And somehow still keep singing?

Oh, like Christ up on a cross
Who died for us, who died for what?
Oh, don't you wanna call it off?

But there is nothing else that I know how to do
But to open up my arms and give it all to you

'Cause I hear the music
I feel the beat
And for a moment
When I'm dancing
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free

// Choreomania //

And I am freaking out in the middle of the street
With the complete conviction of someone who's never had anything actually really bad happen to them
But I am committed now to the feeling

I don't know how it started
Don't know how to stop it
Suddenly, I'm dancin'
To imaginary music

Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death

And this is the end
And I'm thinking about her
Driving around in the backseat of the car
I'll be your demon daddy
And do they speak to you?
'Cause they speak to me too
The pressure and the panic
You push your body through

Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death

You said that rock and roll is dead
But is that just because it has not been
Resurrected in your image?
Like if Jesus came back
But in a beautiful dress
And all the evangelicals were like
"Oh, yes"
"Oh, yes"

Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
(Something's coming, something's coming)
Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
(Something's coming, something's coming)
Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
(Something's coming, something's coming)
Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
(Something's coming, something's coming)

// Back In Town //

Never really been alive before
I always lived in my head
And sometimes it was easier
Hungover and half-dead

I'm back in town, why don't we go out?
Let the rats spin around our feet
The full moon shines down on these dirty streets
I'm back in town, why don't we go out
To that ninth street diner?
And carry on slowly, torturing each other
'Cause it's always the same

I came for the pleasure, but I stayed
Yes, I stayed for the pain

It's lit up like a movie scene
That halogen glow
And if you get spat on, that's just your big city baptism
You're the star of the show

I'm back in town, why don't we go out
And never go to sleep?
Throw our dreams out, let them pile up on the streets
I thought that I was here with you
But it was always just an empty room
'Cause it's always the same

I came for the pleasure, but I stayed
Yes, I stayed for the pain

// Girls Against God //

What a thing to admit
That when someone looks at me with real love
I don't like it very much
Kinda makes me feel like I'm bein' crushed
Is this something that you would like to discuss?

And it's good to be alive
Crying into cereal at midnight
If they ever let me out, I'm gonna really let it out
I listen to music from 2006 and feel kind of sick
But, oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with this

Remember being in that basement with Tom Vek?
Everyone treated us like little pets
Oh, tell me, it's not over yet
And in my darkest fantasies
I am the picture of passivity
Waitin' for you side of stage
Suppressing all my private rage
But as my sister said, I'd probably last six days

Oh, it's good to be alive
Crying into cereal at midnight
And if they ever let me out, I'm gonna really let it out
When I decided to wage Holy War
It looked very much like staring at my bedroom floor
But, oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with me
And I know I may not look like much
Just another screaming speck of dust
But, oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with us
(Oh God, you're gonna get it)

But it's good to be alive
Crying into cereal at midnight
But, oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with us

Oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with us
(Oh God, you're gonna get it)
Oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with me

I met the Devil
You know, he gave me a choice
A golden heart
Or a golden voice

// Dream Girl Evil //

Well, did you miss me?
Walk on water just to kiss me?
Oh, come and get me
Drag me out, destroy me
I've been expecting you, I'm ready
Deliver me that bad news, baby

Am I your dream girl?
You think of me in bed
But you could never hold me
And like me better in your head
Make me evil
Then I'm an angel instead
At least you'll sanctify me when I'm dead

Dream girl evil
Dream girl evil
Dream girl evil
Dream girl evil

Well, did I disappoint you?
Did mommy make you sad?
Do I just remind you
Of every girl that made you mad?
Make me perfect, make me your fantasy
You know I deserve it
Well, take it out on me

Am I your dream girl?
You think of me in bed
But you could never hold me
You like me better in your head
Make me evil
Then I'm an angel instead
At least you'll sanctify me when I'm dead

Dream girl evil
Dream girl evil
Dream girl evil
Dream girl evil

Watch me shimmer (Shimmer)
A projection of your mother (Mother)
But don't come cryin' (Cry)
I am nobody's moral center (Center)

It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold (Dream girl)
It cannot hold (Evil)
It cannot hold (Dream girl)
It cannot hold (Evil)
It cannot hold (Dream girl)
It cannot hold (Evil)
It cannot hold (Dream girl)
It cannot hold (Evil)

// Prayer Factory //

All the things that I ran from
I now bring as close to me as I can
Ripping hotel sheets with gritted teeth
My montage of lost things
My shiny trinkets of grief

Why don't you give me a call?
Open my mouth, yes, I'll take it all
All this work gone to waste
You make me climb, then you shut the gate

// Cassandra //

I used to see the future and now I see nothin'
They cut out my eyes and sent me home packin'
To pace around the kitchen for scraps of inspiration
Cryin' like Cassandra, I
I used to tell the future, but they cut out my tongue
And left me doin' laundry to think on what I've done
It wasn't me, it was the song

I used to move into the future, bring it all back
Let it bleed through my fingers, a treasure in my hands
Now I creep out when there's no one about
'Cause they put crosses on the doors to try and keep me out
The garden's overgrown
And I run in the middle of the road (Ooh)

Well, can you see me?
I cannot see you
Everything I thought I knew has fallen out of view
In this blindness I'm condemned to
Well, can you hear me?
I cannot hear you
Every song I thought I knew, I've been deafened to
And there's no one left to sing to

All the gods have been domesticated
And Heaven is now overrated
And the churches, they all closed their doors
Well, you can take your complaints straight to the Lord
I try to still look with wonder on the world
As the roses bloom
And the riot van still plainly in view

Well, can you see me?
I cannot see you
Everything I thought I knew has fallen out of view
In this blindness that I'm condemned to
Well, can you hear me?
I cannot hear you
Every song I thought I knew, I've been deafened to
And there's no one left to sing to

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh, oh)
Take me back (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, drunken gods of slaughter (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You know I've always been your favorite daughter (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Well, can you see me?
I cannot see you
Everything I thought I knew has fallen out of view
And if I run fast enough
Could I break apart
As empires tumble and cathedrals flatten in my heart?

// Heaven Is Here //

Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette
Draw me a circle and I'll protect
Heaven is here if you want it

Oh, bring your boy, bring your bottle
Open your mouth, pour it down his neck
Heaven is here if you want it

And all of the fish, let them flounder
I went to the water, drank every drop
I'll turn your sea to a desert

More catholic taste than the Devil
All gilded and golden, yes, I'm your girl
Hell, if it glitters, I'm going

And I ride in my red dress
And time stretches endless
With my gun in my hand
You know I always get my man

And every song I wrote became an escape rope
Tied around my neck to pull me up to Heaven

// Daffodil //

I couldn't help it, yes, I let it get in
The helpless optimism of spring
Worn out and tired and my heart never tired
And the world bent double from weeping
And yet, the birds begin to sing
Ooh, ooh, oh

Daffodil
Daffodil

I'm not bad, I'm not good
I drank every scar that I could
Made myself mythical, tried to be real
Saw the future in the face of a

Daffodil
Daffodil
Daffodil
Daffodil

You practice resurrection every night
Raising the dead under the moonlight
And in the gloaming, I start to cry
You're a perfect pearl hung in the sky

There is no bad, there is no good
I drank all the blood that I could
Made myself mythical, tried to be real
Saw the future in the face of a

Daffodil
Daffodil
Daffodil
Daffodil

English sun, she has come
To kiss my face and tell me I'm that chosen one
A generation soaked in grief
We're drying out and hanging on by the skin of our teeth
I never thought it would get this far
This somewhat drunken joke
Sometimes I see so much beauty
I don't think that I can cope

There is no bad, there is no good
I drank every scar that I could
Made myself mythical, tried to be real
Saw the future in the face of a

Daffodil
Daffodil
Daffodil
Daffodil

// My Love //

I was always able to write my way out
Song always made sense to me
Now I find that when I look down
Every page is empty

There is nothing to describe
Except the moon still bright against the worrying sky
I pray the trees will get their leaves soon

So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love

And when it came, it was stranger than I had ever imagined
No cracking open of heaven
But quiet and still (All my friends are getting ill)

So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love
So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love

My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The billboards emptied
My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The buildings emptied

So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love
So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love

My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The billboards emptied
My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The buildings emptied

// Restraint //

And have I learned restraint?
Am I quiet enough for you yet?

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

// The Bomb //

You said this could have been the best thing
That ever happened to you
So you decided not to do it
Now you come back every summer
Like a carnivorous flower
And I stare at your hands in the heat and I
Think that you're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen
But if I was free to love you
You wouldn't want me, would you?
Unavailability is the only thing that turns you on
Come here, baby, tell me that I'm wrong

I've blown apart my life for you
And bodies hit the floor for you
And break me, shake me, devastate me
Come here, baby, tell me that I'm wrong
I don't love you, I just love the bomb
Buildings falling is the only thing that turns me on
I've blown apart my life for you
And bodies hit the floor for you
And break me, shake me, devastate me
Come here, baby, tell me that I'm wrong
I don't love you, I just love the bomb (Oh, oh, oh)
I let it burn, but it just had to be done (Oh, oh, oh)
And I'm in ruins, but is it what I wanted all along?
Sometimes you get the good, sometimes you get a song

// Mermaids //

I thought that I was hungry for blood
Maybe I'm just hungry for love

Tear from a woman on the shore
You prairie ghost on a cottage hall
Oh, the mermaids have sharp teeth
Razor blades all in your feet

England is only ever grey or green
The girls glitter striding glorious and coatless in the rain
I remember fallin' through these streets
Somewhat out of place, if not for the drunkenness

It makes my chest hurt to think of it
Not of regret, but of missing that

Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion

It was not all pain and pavement slick with rain
And shinin' under lights from shitty clubs and doing shitty drugs
And huggin' girls that smelled like Britney Spears and coconuts
And with your mermaid hair and your teeth so sharp
You crawled from the sea to break that sailor's heart
You only get one night up on the shore
So dance like you've never danced before
And the dance floor is filling up with blood
But, oh, Lord, you've never been so in love

Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion

And mermaids, they come once a year
They climb the struts of Brighton Pier
They come to drink, they come to dance
To sacrifice a human heart
And the world is so much wilder than you think
You haven't seen nothin' 'til you seen an English girl drink

Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion

// Morning Elvis //

When they dressed me and they put me on a plane to Memphis, well
I never got to see Elvis
I just sweated it out in a hotel room
But I think the king would have understood
Why I never made it to Graceland
The bathroom tiles were cool against my hand
I pressed my forehead to the floor and prayed for a trapdoor
I've been here many times before
But I've never made it to Graceland

And if I make it to the mornin'
I should've come with a warnin'
And if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be saved

Well, pick me up in New Orleans
Pinned in a bathroom stall
Pick me up above my body
Press my corpse against the wall
I told the band to leave without me
I'll get the next flight
And I'll see you all with Elvis
If I don't survive the night

If I make it to the mornin'
I should've come with a warnin'
And if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be saved

And after every tour, I swear I'll quit
It's over, boys, now this is it
But the call, it always comes
And the songs like children
Begging to be born
But, oh, I guess I got my wish
But anything, anything, anything but this

If I make it to the mornin'
I should've come with a warnin'
But if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be saved
Oh, you know I'm still afraid
I'm still crazy and I'm still scared
But if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be spared

To be spared
To be spared
To be spared
To be spared

// Search And Destroy //

I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
I am a world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys
Honey, gotta help me please
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, detonate for me

Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Solar radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight
Honey, gotta strike me blind
Somebody's gotta save my soul
Baby, penetrate my mind

'Cause I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
And honey, I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin' searchin' to destroy

Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Solar radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight
Honey, gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, penetrate my mind

I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
And honey, I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
Forgotten boy, forgotten boy...

Take me back
Oh, drunken gods of slaughter
You know I've always been your favorite daughter

Well, can you see me?
I cannot see you
And everything I thought I knew has fallen out of view
And if I run fast enough
Well, could I break apart
As empires crumble and cathedrals flatten in my heart?
