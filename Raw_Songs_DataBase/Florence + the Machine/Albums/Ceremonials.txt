Album: Ceremonials

// Only If For A Night //

And I had a dream
About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold and glittering
I threw my arms around her legs
Came to weeping (came to weeping)
Came to weeping (came to weeping)

And I heard your voice
As clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange
And so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night

And the grass was so green against my new clothes
And I did cartwheels in your honour
Dancing on tiptoes
My own secret ceremonials
Before the service began
In the graveyard doing handstands

And I heard your voice
As clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange
And so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night

My doe, my dear, my darling
Tell me what all the sighing's about
Tell me what all the sighing's about

And I heard your voice
As clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange
And so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

Only if for a night

// Shake It Out //

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play

And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around

All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
So I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
And given half the chance would I take any of it back
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
It's always darkest before the dawn

Oh whoa, oh whoa...

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my road
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me
Well what the hell I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

// What The Water Gave Me //

Time it took us
To where the water was
That's what the water gave me
And time goes quicker
Between the two of us
Oh, my love, don't forsake me
Take what the water gave me

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

And oh, poor Atlas
The world's a beast of a burden
You've been holding up a long time
And all this longing
And the ships are left to rust
That's what the water gave us

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

'Cause they took your loved ones
But returned them in exchange for you
But would you have it any other way?
Would you have it any other way?
You couldn't have it any other way

'Cause she's a cruel mistress
And a bargain must be made
But oh, my love, don't forget me
When I let the water take me

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the over flow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

// Never Let Me Go //

Looking up from underneath
Fractured moonlight on the sea
Reflections still look the same to me
As before I went under

And it's peaceful in the deep
Cathedral where you cannot breathe
No need to pray, no need to speak
Now I am under all

And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

Though the pressure's hard to take
It's the only way I can escape
It seems a heavy choice to make
And now I am under all

And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

And it's over
And I'm going under
But I'm not giving up
I'm just giving in

I'm slipping underneath
So cold and so sweet

And the arms of the ocean so sweet and so cold
And all this devotion I never knew at all
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner released
And the arms of the ocean delivered me
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Deliver me
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Deliver me
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Deliver me
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go

And it's over
(Never let me go, Never let me go)
And I'm going under
(Never let me go, Never let me go)
But I'm not giving up
(Never let me go, Never let me go)
I'm just giving in
(Never let me go, Never let me go)

I'm slipping underneath
(Never let me go, Never let me go)
So cold and so sweet
(Never let me go, Never let me go)

// Breaking Down //

All alone
It was always there you see
And even on my own
It was always standing next to me

I can see it coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight
Holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?

Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down

All alone
Even when I was a child
I've always known
There was something to be frightened of

You know that I can see you coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight
Holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?

Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down

All alone
On the edge of sleep
My old familiar friend
Comes and lies down next to me

And I can see you coming from the edge of the room
Smiling in the streetlight
Even with my eyes shut tight
I still see you coming now

Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down

// Lover To Lover //

I've been losing sleep,
I've been keeping myself awake,
I've been wandering the streets,
For days and days and days,

Going from road to road
Bed to bed
Lover to lover,
And black to red,

But I believe,
I believe...

There's no salvation for me now,
No space among the clouds,
And I feel I'm heading down,
But that's alright,
That's alright,
That's alright!
That's alright!

And I've been taking chances,
I've been setting myself up for the fall,
I've been keeping secrets,
From my heart and from my soul

Going from road to road,
Bed to bed,
Lover to lover,
Black to red,

But I believe,
I believe...
There's no salvation for me now,
No space among the clouds,
And I feel I'm heading down,
But that's alright,
That's alright,
That's alright!
That's alright!

Going from road to road,
And bed to bed,
And lover to lover,
And black to red,
And road to road,
Bed to bed,
And lover to lover!

No space among the clouds...
And I feel I'm heading down...
But that's alright,
That's alright,
That's alright!
That's alright!
That's alright!
That's alright!

Road to road!
Bed to bed!
And lover to lover!
And black to red!
And road to road!
Bed to bed!
Lover to lover
To lover to lover
To lover to lover
To lover to lover
To lover to lover
To lover to lover...

No salvation for me now...
No salvation for me now...
No salvation for me now...
No salvation for me now...

// No Light, No Light //

You are the hole in my head
You are the space in my bed
You are the silence in between
What I thought and what I said

You are the night time fear
You are the morning when it's clear
When it's over you're the start
You're my head, you're my heart

No light, no light in your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away

And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
No light
Tell me what you want me to say

Through the crowd, I was crying out
And in your place there were a thousand other faces
I was disappearing in plain sight
Heaven help me, I need to make it right

You want a revelation,
You wanna get it right
But it's a conversation,
I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation
Some kind of resolution
You want a revelation

No light, no light in your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day,
You can't choose what stays and what fades away

And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
No light
Tell me what you want me to say

Would you leave me,
If I told you what I've done?
And would you need me,
If I told you what I've become?
'Cause it's so easy,
To say it to a crowd
But it's so hard, my love,
To say it to you out loud

No light, no light in your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day,
You can't choose what stays and what fades away

And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
No light
Tell me what you want me to say

You want a revelation,
You wanna get it right
But it's a conversation,
I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation
Some kind of resolution
You want a revelation

You want a revelation,
You wanna get it right
But it's a conversation,
I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation, some kind of resolution
Tell me what you want me to say.

// Seven Devils //

Holy water cannot help you now
Thousand armies couldn't keep me out
I don't want your money
I don't want your crown
See I've come to burn your kingdom down

Holy water cannot help you now
See I've come to burn your kingdom down
And no rivers and no lakes can put the fire out
I'm gonna raise the stakes, I'm gonna smoke you out

Seven devils all around me!
Seven devils in my house!
See they were there when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done

Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See I was dead when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done

And now all your love will be exorcised
And we will find you saints to be canonized
And it's an even song
It's a melody
It's a battle cry
It's a symphony

Seven devils all around me
Seven devils in my house
See they were there when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done

Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See I was dead when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done
Before the day is done
Before the day is done

They can keep me out
'Til I tear the walls
'Til I save your heart
And to take your soul
For what has been done
Cannot be undone
In the evil's heart
In the evil's soul

Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See I was dead when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
'Fore the day is done

// Heartlines //

Oh the river, oh the river,
It's running free.
And oh the joy, oh the joy
It brings to me.

But I know it'll have to drown me,
Before it can breathe easy.

And I've seen it in the flights of birds,
I've seen it in you.
The entrails of the animals,
The blood running through.

But in order to get to the heart,
I think sometimes you'll have to cut through.

But you can't…

We will carry…
You can't…
We will carry you there…
You can't…

Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!

Keep it up!
I know you can!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!
'Cause I am…

Odyssey on odyssey
And land over land.
Creeping and crawling
Like the sea over sand.

Still I follow heartlines on your hand.

This fantasy, this fallacy,
This tumbling stone
Echoes of a city
That's long overgrown.

Your heart is the only place that I call home,
I cannot be returned.

You can…
(Keep it up)
You can…
You can…
I know you can…

Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!

Keep it up!
I know you can!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!

What a thing to do…
What a thing to choose…
But know, in some way I'm there with you.
Up against the wall on a Wednesday afternoon.

Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!

Keep it up!
I know you can!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!

'Cause I am.

// Spectrum //

When we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colors on our skin
We were light and paper thin

And when we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colors on our skin
'Til we let the spectrum in

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
As every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
As every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

And when we come for you
We'll be dressed up all in blue
With the ocean in our arms
Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms

And when it's time to pray
We'll be dressed up all in grey
With metal on our tongues
And silver in our lungs

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
As every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
As every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

And when we come back we'll be dressed in black
And you'll scream our names aloud
And we won't eat and we won't sleep
We'll drag bodies from the ground

So say my name
And every color illuminates
And we are shining
And we'll never be afraid again

Say my name
As every color illuminates

Say my name
As every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
As every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
We are shining
Say my name
Say my name
And we will never be afraid again

// All This And Heaven Too //

And the heart is hard to translate
It has a language of its own
It talks in tongues and quiet sighs
And prayers and proclamations
In the grand deeds of great men and the smallest of gestures
And short shallow gasps

But with all my education I can't seem to command it
And the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how
I can't seem to understand it

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all

And it talks to me in tiptoes
And it sings to me inside
It cries out in the darkest night and breaks in the morning light

But with all my education I can't seem to command it
And the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how
I can't seem to understand it

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all

No, words are a language
It doesn't deserve such treatment
And all of my stumbling phrases never amounted to anything worth this feeling

All this heaven never could describe such a feeling as I'm hearing

Words were never so useful
So I was screaming out a language that I never knew existed before

// Leave My Body //

I'm gonna be released from behind these lines
And I don't care whether I live or die
And I'm losing blood, I'm gonna leave my bones
And I don't want your heart it leaves me cold

I don't want your future
I don't need your past
One bright moment
Is all I ask

I'm gonna leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
I'm gonna lose my mind
(History keeps pulling me down)
Said I'm gonna leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
I'm gonna lose my mind
(History keeps pulling me, pulling me down)

I don't need a husband, don't need no wife
And don't need the day, I don't need the night
And I don't need the birds let them fly away
And I don't want the clouds, they never seem to stay

I don't want no future
I don't need no past
One bright moment
Is all I ask

I don't want your future
I don't need your past
One bright moment
Is all I ask

I'm gonna leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
I'm gonna lose my mind
(History keeps pulling me down)
Said I'm gonna leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
I'm gonna lose my, lose my mind
(History keeps pulling me, pulling me down)

Pulling me down
Pulling me down
Pulling me down
Pulling me, pulling me down

I'm gonna leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
I'm gonna lose my mind
(History keeps pulling me down)
Said I'm gonna leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
I'm gonna lose my mind
(History keeps pulling me, pulling me down)

Yeah, said I'm gonna leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
I'm gonna lose my mind
(History keeps pulling me down)
(moving up to higher ground)
(History keeps pulling me, pulling me down)

// Remain Nameless //

I was born in a big gray cloud
Screaming out a love song
All the broken chords and unnamed cries
What a place to come from

I wish to remain nameless
And live without shame
'Cause what's in a name, Oh
I still remain the same

You can call it what you want
You can call me anything you want
You can call us what you want
You can call me anything you want

Everybody lets you down
In this brief hole of a town
What a difference of the rushing out
Tell me what you're running from

I know everybody lets you down
I'll do the same
But know I'll always be around
This can remain the same

Call me when you need me
Call me anything you want
Darling, believe me
Nothing I haven't done before

Call me when you need me, call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Darling, believe me, darling, believe me
Darling, believe me, darling believe me

Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me

Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me

Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me

Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me
Darling, believe me

Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me

Darling, believe me, darling believe me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me

// Strangeness & Charm //

Hydrogen in our veins, it cannot hold itself, our blood is boiling
And the pressure in our bodies that echoes up above it is exploding
And our particles that burn it all because they aim for each other
And although we stick together it seems that we are stranging one another

Feel it on me love
Feel it on me love
Feel it on me love

See it on me love

Atom to atom oh what's the matter with me love

The static of your arms, it is the catalyst
You're a chemical that burns there is nothing like this
It's the purest element but it's so volatile
An equation heaven sent, a drug for angels

// Bedroom Hymns //

This is as good a place to fall as any
We'll build our altar here
Make me your Maria
I'm already on my knees

You had Jesus on your breath
And I caught him in mine
Sweating our confessions
The undone and the divine

'Cause this is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers
And I can't get enough

Oh, woah, woah, oh
Oh, whoa, whoa, yeah

Spilled milk tears,
I did this for you
Spilling over the idol
The black and the blue

The sweetest submission
Drinking it in
The wine, the women, the bedroom hymns

'Cause this is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers and I can't get enough

Oh, woah, woah, oh
Whoa, whoa, yeah
I can't get enough

I'm not here looking for absolution
Because I found myself an old solution
I'm not here looking for absolution
Because I found myself an old solution

This is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers, I can't get enough

This is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers, I can't get enough
Whoa, whoa, yeah
I can't get enough
Whoa, whoa, yeah
I can't get enough
Whoa, whoa, yeah

// What The Water Gave Me (Demo) //

Time it took us
To where the water was
That's what the water gave me
And time goes quicker
Between the two of us
Oh, my love, don't forsake me
Take what the water gave me

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

And oh, poor Atlas
The world's a beast of a burden
You've been holding up a long time
And all this longing
And the ships are left to rust
That's what the water gave us

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

'Cause they took your loved ones
But returned them in exchange for you
But would you have it any other way?
Would you have it any other way?
You couldn't have it any other way

'Cause she's a cruel mistress
And her temper cannot be tamed
But oh, my love, don't forsake me
Take what the the water gave me

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the over flow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

// Landscape (Demo) //

She can't see the landscape anymore
It's all painted in her grief
All of her history etched out at her feet

Now all of the landscape, it's just an empty place
Acres of longing, mountains of tenderness

Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
Cause it's burning through the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me

She wants the silence but fears the solitude
She wants to be alone and together with you
So she ran to the lighthouse, hoped that it would help her see
She saw that the lighthouse had been washed out to sea

Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
Cause it's burning through the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me

I wanna give you back the open sky
Give you back the open sea
Open up the ages, darling, for you to see

You put the gun into your mouth to bite
You pull it and spit out
Cause it's running in the family
All the richer between you and me

Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
Cause it's burning in the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me
