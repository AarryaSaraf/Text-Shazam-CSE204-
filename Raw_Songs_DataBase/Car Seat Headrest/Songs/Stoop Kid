This city has its share of stairs, la da da da da da
And if you stay there, no one cares, la da da da da da
These boxes I should probably recycle
This city has its share of stairs, la da da da da da

I haven't eaten in so long
Stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
I'd like to travel the world, babe
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop

The concrete breaks my heart again, la da da da da da
Some kid walks by, I spit at them, la da da da da da
The grocery store will still be there tomorrow
The concrete breaks my heart again, la da da da da da

I want a therapist more fucked up than me
Stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
Because I look in your eyes like a deer looks into headlights
Stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop

If I had a little time
Maybe I could start to find my way out
But every time I move my feet, dance my way onto the street
I lose it
There's still beer cans on the step
I pretend that I have kept on purpose
But when the trashman comes around
I just start to feel so down I can't move

La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da

I haven't eaten in so long
Stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
I'd like to travel the world, babe
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop

But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
(But stoop kid's afraid to leave)
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
(But stoop kid's afraid to leave)
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
(But stoop kid's afraid to leave)
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
(But stoop kid's afraid to leave)
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
(But stoop kid's afraid to leave)
