The early bird catches the worm, I have worms in mousetraps, baby
I did something bad, I'm not allowed to go outside anymore
I can only be awake at night for the next year of my life
In the freshly dug earth in front of the cabin

I feel so haunted

Seeing the world in petals, everything made of roses
I know cause when I close my eyes I see red spots
Seeing the world in petals, everything made of roses
I know cause when I close my eyes I see red spots

I feel so haunted

Is there some rule that guys can never talk about everything
They just watch the girls go by
How are you tonight? Just look straight ahead
Are you still in school?

Promise me you'll go inside when I leave
I don't want you hanging around
Please don't fight, please don't argue
I'm just looking out for you

There's a crack in my window, all the peeping toms come and peep
Whenever I'm in the nude, they all line up down the streets
No one seems to notice, no one seems to care
It doesn't really matter, I'll just put on my underwear

I'm getting haunted

I know I'm drunk again and I've said enough for the night
But there's a skin I'd like to steal
A house to sleep in where I won't have bad dreams
But I have so much to fear
Get some exercise, get me exorcised
But do we ever really heal?
These problems are familiar, these songs that I've been singing
For God, it feels like years

Promise me you'll go inside when I leave
I don't want you hanging around
Please don't fight, please don't argue
I'm just looking out for you

I feel so haunted

The early bird catches the worm...and I have...worms in fishhooks...and dogs in dogtraps...and cats in cattraps. But baby, I still feel like I can't get outta something....

If I stacked up all the hours I wasted I could climb straight to heaven
