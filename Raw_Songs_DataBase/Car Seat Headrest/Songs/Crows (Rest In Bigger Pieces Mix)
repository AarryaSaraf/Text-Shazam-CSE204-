I am not I am not I am not I am not I'm alive
Hey boys, stop being so mean
Calling your girlfriend names

Sweatshirts strings dangling
Under fluorescent lighting
Sweatshirt strings strangling
Inside the parking complex

No longer hampered by the weight of our SKIN....
We focus solely on the pleasures WITHIN......
Abandoned hallways with the lights FLICKERING....
The empty parking lot we fold our BONES in.....
Street lights reflecting makes an asphalt HALO....
The night-time is the right-time come on let's GO....
It was much darker at the time don't you KNOW....
The color's faded out on this VIDEO....
LET'S GO!!!!
