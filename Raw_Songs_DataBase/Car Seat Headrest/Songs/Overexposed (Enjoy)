You used to have a future, now you don't even have a past
You won't have half an answer if anyone cares to ask
You promised to speak to no one, you were lucky that I heard
Because without a witness no oath can be assured

Somewhere down the line you'll look back and
Say you did the best that you could and you'll be wrong
You're always wrong

I hope you enjoy it underneath the light
I hope you can get some sleep tonight
Because where you live the sun doesn't set
This is your bed. Hope you enjoy

You held me in the sunlight, your interlocking hands
Left a photograph on my shoulders, spots where I didn't tan
But my skin was an imperfect film and the negatives were burned
Without the evidence there was no need for you to ever return

And someone down the line will look back
And wonder what you felt for me and he'll be wrong
You're always wrong

I hope you enjoy it underneath the light
I hope you can get some sleep tonight
Because where you live the sun doesn't set
This is your bed. Hope you enjoy

I can't turn this thing off
It keeps following me
Used to be so human now it's just a machine
I can't turn this thing off
It keeps following me
When'd you say you were leaving?
When'd you really leave?

I hope you enjoy it underneath the light
I hope you can get some sleep tonight
Because where you live the sun doesn't set
If this is your bed, how do you do it?
I was within my rights, I was behind the line
You were dancing in your sleep
I promised to hide it under the covers
This is my bed, how do you do?
Hope I enjoy my no one
