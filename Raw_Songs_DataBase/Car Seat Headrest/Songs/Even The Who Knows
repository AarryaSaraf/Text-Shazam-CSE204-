Can I blame whatever makes a noise
Makes me alone, makes me annoyed?
Who even knows why my heart beats loudly
Who even knows why my eyes get cloudy
You are a palindrome spelled wrong
You need to give me back my mom
Who even knows that I'm good hearted?
Who even knows that I'm free?

You are a god, In the machines
You are screaming, "Death to all mankind"
Who even knows why I have no man
Who even knows why the chance is dim
You are a palindrome spelled right
You make me want to sleep all night
Who even knows what I feel now and
Who even knows why my legs are tired

No windows, I'll forget how to fly
We can't go, I'll forget how to fly
Be inside, I'll forget how to fly
We can't fly, I'll forget how to fly

You are a palindrome spelled wrong
You need to give me back my mom
Who even knows that I'm good hearted?
Who even knows that I'm free?
