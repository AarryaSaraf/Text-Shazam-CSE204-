...And any remaining interest my friends have in me
Is just "hey, hey, this animal can talk!"

So all your friends are leaving town
You're hiding out in your parents' house
They wonder why you never go to church
Hard to explain why it doesn't work
Cause you're not living in sin well
But you're not living in health well
And you're a danger to yourself well
And to pedestrians
I co-write my songs with myself
He feels the feelings I write the words
I co-write my songs with myself
He feels the feelings I write the words
He writes down his feelings
I say "what are you doing?"
And he never saw the bright lights
And he never had a good time
And he never saw the bright lights
And he never saw the good times

So I sleep in my old loft bed
And search for hope inside my head
But even in my dreams
I know the difference between
What I want and what I got
Cause what I got is mumble mumble how are you doing? 
Why's the door locked? 
I'll be out in a minute second, ooh these are good lyrics, 
I should charge a dollar per thought
And what I want...

Love isn't love enough
At least not how I'm making it
Love isn't love enough
I think this is the other thing

Don't get mad at the system
You can't change the system
Get mad at your lover
You can affect your lover
Like pulling out nails with the back of the hammer

Spending my money in 12 dollar increments
Milkshake plus tip adds up to more than I think
And I admit my heart is a laughingstock
But that's why that's why that's why that's why
Cause I don't want to be perceived yeah
As a thing you can believe in
I'm an optical illusion
And pretty soon I think I'm leaving

When I stopped laughing and got to thinking
When I stopped laughing at how much we were drinking
When you never called me back
While I was staring at the paint crack

Fun while it lasted but it didn't last
It was fun while it lasted but it didn't
It was fun while it lasted but it didn't last
It was fun while it lasted but it didn't

Like pulling out nails with the back of the hammer

"only her voice and bones are left; at last
Only her voice, her bones are turned to stone"
