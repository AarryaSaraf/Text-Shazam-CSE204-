Back when I had time to dream
I dreamed of ordinary faces
Frozen unexpressed emotions
Trapped inside the wax museum
And what my mind had been curating
Scandalized my sense of station
My face poured in, and I woke up
Feeling like shit when I saw my ordinary face
I should start lifting weights

Put your heart on the target
They expect you to scream
Music blasts through the market
It's the sound of machines
And quarters crushing the penny
One bout turned into many
My resistance is crushed
I'm just here about some tangerines
And maybe grapes without seeds

'Cause I believe that thoughts can change your body
It's all on me if thoughts can change your body
I believe that thoughts can change my body
You don't know me, your body can't change your mind

And maybe if I keep my mouth shut
God will answer all my prayers
Let my secret vision sprawl
Declasssified another ship
And then I put my arms around you
And say, "Thank God that I found you"
I kept my mouth shut
And hoped that this would happen to me

I see the patterns in things
I never knew this was a part of me
He who sings in the choir
I feel the tension, I'm afraid it will break
I should start lifting weights

'Cause I believe that thoughts can change your body
It's all on me if thoughts can change your body
I believe that thoughts can change my body
You don't know me, your body can't change your mind
