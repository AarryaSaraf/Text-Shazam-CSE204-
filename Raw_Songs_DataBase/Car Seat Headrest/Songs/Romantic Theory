I didn't like you anyways
You always spoke so quiet
I had to ask you to repeat yourself

I'd like to explain to all of my friends
To everyone involved
How it all happened
How things fell apart

Let's reconstruct the scene
As best we can and try to figure out
What crimes were committed

I saw you again last night you were
Hiding in a poor man's body
But I saw your soul slip out of his fingers
