Hard to sleep when you're not alone
Hard to talk when you're on the phone
I can't laugh when you say something
That is not funny, I mean I guess I'm sorry
It's okay, I know you're trying hard
It isn't working out, why don't we try again
At a later time

Awkward jokes
(Awkward jokes)
Won't help me get to know you
But it's the only
(But it's the only)
Way we can communicate, break the ice open

I don't like people I don't know
I shaved my eyebrows a bit too much
It's not that I don't like to talk to people at all
I just don't know where to start, or how can I jump in
To this conversation

"Don't be shy"
(Don't be shy)
Is not genuine encouragement
Hard-earned trust
(Hard-earned trust)
That is what I'm looking for, not an ice cream social
(And a ropes course)
