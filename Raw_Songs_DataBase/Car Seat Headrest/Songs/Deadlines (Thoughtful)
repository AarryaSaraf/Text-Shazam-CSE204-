I am not awake
I am not asleep
I am not so shallow
I am not that deep

Do you wanna dance?
Someone shut the door
On the losing side
Of some sort of war

He said, "I'd like to do this for a living
But I don't know how"
Why would all the commercials
Sleep in our beliefs

There was a predestined set of symbols
Taking in the place of Prom Queen crown in the background
Stepping out in front, a pair of Vans took me to your place
Your eyes help me

Old compassion
It's transforming me into
Old compassion
It's transforming me into

No long reflection
Swearing all I see is you

Old compassion
It's transforming me into
Old compassion
It's transforming me into

Old compassion
It's transforming me into
(I think I'm on to something)
Old compassion
It's transforming me into
(Shut up)
(Shut the fu-)
Old compassion
It's transforming me into
(Shut, shut up)
(Hey)
