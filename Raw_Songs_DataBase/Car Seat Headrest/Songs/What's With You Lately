Oh, I never heard back from you

He looks like you but he's not
And he's in your seat
He's copying your style
But he doesn't know the first thing

You know, a couple of the guys
Were thinking about moving away
'Cause there's less and less here
That seems like it's a reason to stay

You're not the only one who's angry
You shut the door, they call you crazy
You always said, "They'll never break me"
What's with you lately?
