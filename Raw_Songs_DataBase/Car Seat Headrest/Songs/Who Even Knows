Can I blame whatever makes a noise
Makes me alone, makes me annoyed
Who even knows why my heart beats loudly
Who even knows why my eyes get cloudy
You are a palindrome spelled wrong
You need to give me back my mom
Who even knows that I'm good-hearted
Who even knows that I'm retarded

You won't listen to me
You won't watch my TV
You don't like my movies
Not at all
I won't come back to you again
I won't spend time with my friends
I won't talk to women
Not at all

You are a god in the machines
Screaming "death to all mankind"
Who even knows why I have no hair
Who even knows why my friends sleep bare
You are a palindrome spelled right
You and me want to sleep all night
Who even knows what I feel now and
Who even knows why my legs are tired

You won't listen to me
You won't watch my TV
You don't like my movies
Not at all
I won't come back to you again
I won't spend time with my friends
I won't talk to women
Not at all

We're adults
We can fight
We're up all night again
Don't be mad
At yourself
You should be mad at me

You won't listen to me
You won't watch my TV
You don't like my movies
Not at all
I won't come back to you again
I won't spend time with my friends
I won't talk to women
Not at all
