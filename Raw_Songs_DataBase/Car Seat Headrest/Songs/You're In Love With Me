Hello hello hello hello
I'm so excited to finally be here
Maybe I'm a little embarrassed but
It's alright
It's alright

Just take it to the left brain
Shake it to the right brain
Try to get lost
Somewhere in the middle brain

You could be in love with anyone
But you're not in love with anyone because
You're in love with me

Last night I dreamed Obama came to my birthday
Party and they made a giant banner of my face
I wished they hadn't used driver's license photo but
It's alright
It's alright

And I could sense you somewhere in the crowd
And I knew that Barack would be proud
Because you could be in love with anyone
But you're not in love with anyone

You're in love with me
