The drunk's face breaks into sweat
As his friend falls under the wheels
But the headlights don't flinch
And the engine doesn't stutter
Oh yeah

Think about myself
I think about myself
Care about myself
I care about myself
I only care about myself

And other fears too stupid to mention
The ending of 'Dramamine' scared Degnan

The way that you all see me
That's who I am, but not who I need to be
Moving my joke body through the cold November night
Haha

Hate yourself
Do you hate yourself
I don't hate myself
I tolerate myself
I wish I was someone else

But it seems too stupid to mention
I know I'll be ripped in heaven

I was young, I was thin
I had money and I loved you
But then came the
Shabba de bop bop be shibby day oh yeah
I need a name for what I'm feeling
Then I can start to work on a meaning
Speaking of the
Shabba de bop bop be shibby day oh yeah

In a crowded room you will
Hear your own opinion voiced
You can sit back without a word
Watch it spread or fall silent
Oh yeah

If it's too late to speak
I could get out of bed
Find a pencil and write
Leave it for you to find
If the moment is gone

To say I figured out what the problem was
I'd been thinking about it earlier

Hey! can you hear me now?
Am I alone in my futile efforts?
Sometimes I get so mad that I can't do the few things I usually can
Which is sad

Occupying space
I know I take up space
Will there be a space
For my soul in space
(that's heaven to me)

And now I'm young, and I'm thin
I have money and I love you
But here comes the
Shabba de bop bop be shibby day oh yeah
(thanks for fucking with my head, come again soon)
I need a name for what I'm feeling
Then I can start to work on a meaning
Speaking of the
Shabba de bop bop be shibby day oh yeah
(thanks for fucking with my head, come again soon)

I can't hear a thing now
I guess I belong to me now

But when night fell on Montana
I found a rest stop completely deserted
But I still felt the eyes upon me
So I drove away
