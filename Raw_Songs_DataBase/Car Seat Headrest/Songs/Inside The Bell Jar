This is all the fault, the fucking coffee house
The fucking coffee house

My phone did not ring
My name was not on the list
I was not invited
I did not make the list
My life did not come up
My doorbell made no sound
There were no taps on my shoulder
I did not not not not look around

I spent no money, yenom on tneps I
I drove no where, erehw on evord I
I saw nobody, ydobon was I
I did not care, erac ton did I

I was not burning the midnight oil
I had no one with which to grin ear to ear
I turned on the gas
And rested my head upon the racks of the oven

This is all the fault, the fucking coffee house
The fucking coffee house
