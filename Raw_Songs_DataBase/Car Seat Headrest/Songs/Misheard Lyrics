Everything you say is a bridge
Everything you do is water under it
These are not the original lyrics
Such a worthless waste of time to write about

Every bit of you that I don't love
Is filled up with my hate
I was a situation
That you were glad went away

Move move forward like a human being
(sometimes you have to kill things to impress your friends)
You probably looked like an idiot in that hat
(used to feel bad about crushing ants)

(why why why why why to die)
I can't go back to not understanding what you mean to me
I'm turning into the person that you were afraid I'd turn out to be

There is something in me that can only give
There is something in you that can only give out
When you hear my songs do you get that feeling
And if not, what the hell were you hearing?

I am not crazy, I am right
What do you mean? what are saying to me?
I was just another bird you touched
Whose mother won't take him back

I'm sorry I misheard your lyrics
(tried to smile but it didn't show up in the photograph)
I was searching for a soul to sell my devils to
(all I wanted was sleep and you took it away)

(yes yes yes yes yes I dislike I hate)
Did you do something wrong was there something you did that I could blame
I thought I was open I thought I was intimate and then you asked me my name

By the time they send the lifeboats
I won't want to leave the island
Calling out to distant shorelines
Calling out for different basslines

I can't go back to not understanding what you mean to me
I'm turning into the person that you were afraid that I'd turn out to be

Ooh, it was nothing special
Ooh, it was nothing sacred
Just hands held
And shoulders rubbed
And voices touched
In holy harmony
