I did not wash my hand after
Pissing on an essay which was supposed to be graded 
(I did not wash my hands after)

Nine point rubric (I feel like if I'm not saying something humorous, then I'm just wasting everybody's time when I talk)

We said something creepy
You said something creepy
And I said something crabby
We said something creepy (We saw someone I don't know)
We said no one knows
You said something creepy (We saw someone I don't know)
We said no more
I said something creepy (We saw no one knows)
We said no one no
