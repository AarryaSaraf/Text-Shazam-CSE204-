Do you want an accident to happen?
Don't think I don't know what you're asking for
You think that I'm in love, punk
You've been a punk since the day you were born

I've never been good with weapons
But you want me to teach you with my bare hands
I really liked your solo album, but, punk
Don't think I want to be in your band

Cause you're in love with jerks
And I'm not confident

I get concerned when accidents are happening
Hate is raining down like piss
Piercing my ears, yeah you're out for blood, punk
Don't think I want to listen to this

Careful with the love police!

Maybe sunglasses to cover the bruises
Maybe a hole in a bathroom stall
Maybe somebody that you're thinking of, punk
Ain't thinking about you at all

Cause you're in love with jerks
And I'm not confident

I wanna be your jerk
Cause you in love with jerks
Revival of the jerks
You waste your life on jerks
