Send me a letter, send me your glow
I got it bad now, I want your clothes
Send me a picture, send me your glow
I got your soul now, I got your clothes

Send me a letter, send me your glow
I got it back now, I got your clothes
Send me a picture, send me your glow
I got your soul now, I got your clothes

Hey teenagers, take off your clothes
