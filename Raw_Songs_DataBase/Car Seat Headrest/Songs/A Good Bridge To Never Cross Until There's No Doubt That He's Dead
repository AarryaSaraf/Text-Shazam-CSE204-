The scar on my ankle 
The scar on my ankle

Looks like a sideways numeral 1
Like it's trying to be infinity
But it doesn't know
Only 8 is allowed to do that

Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go back there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there

A good bridge to never cross until there's no doubt that he's
(Now there's the man who punched me
Oh look he's looking at me)
A good bridge to never cross until there's no doubt that he's
(Now there's the man who loves me
I think he's trying not to look suspicious)
Looks like a sideways numeral one, and he's trying to be infinity
(In our hallway, unless I look the other way
We have matching ties and this is cool)
But it doesn't know only eight is allowed to do that
