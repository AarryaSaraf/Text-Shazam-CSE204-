I never told my mom-

Does it make you with the Anti-Christ when it does sexual fantasies you have are Christmas theme-

From car door, using a Wachovia receipt which might or might-

One night, my only lover sees me, she involuntarily grits her teeth
And then my own father beats me
In a game of Monopoly

It looks like your eyes are broke in half, only seeing north-

What are you listening to?
That's a good song

Running through his "baby", you know in his head, he sees a "b a y hyphen b e e"

Running through his "baby", you know in his head, he sees a "b a y hyphen b-"

It was the only way that I could survive it

It was the only way that I could survive it
I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I was referring to the present in past tense

I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
