I feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart

(Feel it in my)
(Feel it in my)
(Feel it in my)
(Feel it in my)

If I give this up
Will I be safe?
Will my life be spared?

I feel it in my heart (Oh, I won't take its place)
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart (I won't take its place)
Feel it in my heart (I won't take its place)
