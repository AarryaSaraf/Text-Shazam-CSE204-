What a glorious hell we have found until I recognize the sound
Of my voice again
For years I hadn't had a clue, but suddenly I can look through
Your eyes again

This isn't sex, I don't think, it's just extreme empathy
She's not my ex, we never met, but do you still think of me?

They say that the world is one, but if the world is one
How come you never come around anymore?
Well, I guess it's not that simple

Well, everyone learns to live with their sins
But girl you wear yours like a brand new skin
So take it all off
And let me back into your...

It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl

It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl

At least I don't think so

Welcome to the workshop
Lesson number one:
Nothing stays but the chorus
(Nothing stays but the chorus)
But she moves and
She speaks and
She's on a chain that moves towards perfection
Baby, the effects are so good these days
If there were gears behind those big brown eyes
I wouldn't be able to tell the difference

Now listen girl (yeah?)
Don't touch that dial
I'm gonna say that's one more time (yeah?)
Because I feel like we're both on the same page
And you know how rare it is for two human beings to be on the exact same page
At the exact same time
But still I gotta ask (yeah?)
We're dancing, right? (yeah?)
This is a dance, isn't it? (yeah?)

Well, everyone learns to live with themselves
And you're not the only one who's been through hell
So give me a sign that I'm not making love to myself

It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(Oh, that's right)
It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl

Aye!
It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl)
It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl)
