As if on cue
They lit a firework
The sky reeled back
And I ran fast to get to you

I think you knew
Before the war began
What loving to run towards
Something can do to a man

Fall over the edge
Learn to live while falling
Every life is a path worth following
When you put into words
It's comfortingly bland
There's so little left to understand

When we're strung up, hanging
From the knots we've allowed
We call up our angels to cut us down
If you could be proud of anything you've done
What would it be?
Then you disappear and we are up in the clouds

I feel the tension shock right through my body
I am wide awake
Trippin' meant for me

I thought one day
I thought I'd find a hole
In my own backyard
I'd never seen before
Follow it down
Underneath that fence
Come back up on the other side
Live another life

Break down the door, it's yours for the taking
I held it back until you stopped asking
My eyes are blurred, the clock is ticking
I'm coming up short in a life worth nothing
I hear women in my head with ordinary names
That ring like magic to somehow function in my brain
Your hands were warm though you came in from the cold
I took one and held it and suddenly I started to shake
Shake
Shake
Shake
Sha-ake

I feel it break, I feel the weight
Of anger, pain and sorrow
Breaking out of me

The flags are raised
We fought with no more advice
And no tomorrows
This is destiny

Memories of the best regrets
I played my song in every single way
Every note of the symphony

Men will fence with the best of grace
And it's pleasantries to the bottom of the page
I'm sorry
