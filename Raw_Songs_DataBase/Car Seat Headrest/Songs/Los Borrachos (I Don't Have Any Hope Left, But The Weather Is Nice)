Being sad's so boring
I'm taking a vacation
I'm driving down to see my old friends tonight

Let's spend the week with rosy cheeks
And crush the grapes beneath our feet
And stop burrowing through old chocolate boxes
Like a heartbroken Bacchus

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

I miss those good old boys
They could still find joy in life to talk about

So leave that girl behind you
Or whatever it is that's got you
We've still got time for one more drink tonight

Think what the others would say
If they saw you in the bathroom
Kicking the stall door
They'd say get out of your head for a while
Jump into mine
Leave it on repeat and it says

And if I'd been a parrot I'd have been a very good parrot
And if I'd been a parent I'd have been my own parents
And if that's not apparent then it will be soon

I miss those good old boys
They could still find joy in life to talk about

I miss you
(I don't have any hope left, but the weather is nice)

If you're trying to live, you have to own what you do
If you're trying to live, you have to own what you do
Oh Jesus Christ I, I wish I could talk like that
But such is my place in life

I, I don't have
I don't have any hope
I don't have any hope left, but the weather is nice

I miss you
