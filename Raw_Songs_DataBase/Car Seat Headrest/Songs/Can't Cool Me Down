(Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, can't cool me down
Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, can't cool me down)

Schizophrenia dreaming
I got a real bad feeling
With a taste like lemon
Having trouble breathing
Getting high on nothing
Taking credit for nothing
Inside my head is an empty head
Introducing friends to friends

There is a hole in the ceiling
Everything but me and it has got no feeling
Smoke is pouring out the vents
I crawl like an animal to ya
(Crawl, crawl, an animal to ya)
It's a time of need and I need you to help me
(I crawl, I crawl, an animal to ya)
Please
(I crawl, I crawl, an animal to ya)
Animal to ya
(I crawl, I crawl, an animal to ya)
An animal to ya

Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, can't cool me down
Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, can't cool me down

Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, it can't cool me down
(No, it can't-)

Vivid visions
It's been so long since I
Heard your voice and
Felt your feeling for me
Camille Raquin at the mortuary
I like Chopin, won't you sing me to sleep?
No, don't, Daniel
(No, don't, Daniel)
You think you see a light but
There is nothing in a flame but fire
(There is nothing)
Is it satisfaction?
(Is it satisfaction?)
Is it only practice for the real thing?
(Is it only practice for the real thing?)
Snap out of the drug trip screaming

Hey, we're not supposed to be here!
(We're not supposed to be here)
Hey, we're not supposed to be here!
(We're not supposed to be here)
Now my blood is dirty water
Drain it, bleed it, wash it down the drain
The devil in the other, somebody else's mistake
I am dripping with sweat, my hands
I can't hold anything in my hands
I've only made one mistake in my life
I've only made one mistake, I'm going

Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, no, it can't cool me down
Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, it can't cool me down

Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, it can't cool me down

Cool

(Cool me down, cool me down)
(Cool me down, cool me down)
(Cool me down, cool me down)
(Cool me down, cool me down)
