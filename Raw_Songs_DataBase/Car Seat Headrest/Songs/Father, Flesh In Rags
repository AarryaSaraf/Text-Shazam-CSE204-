My back is killing me baby
I don't have any comfortable chairs
My spine will become warped
I won't be able to stand up straight

And I don't brush my teeth twice a day
Now I will lose them all in old age
La de da de da de da
I'll have to glue some fake ones on

Volcanic rock can be dated reliably
Genotypes, phenotypes
And I will have my father's bald spot

Have to remember not to smile
Will lead to wrinkles in later life
And don't furrow your brow
Your forehead will grow ridges

I wish I didn't have veins
My eyeballs can feel my heartbeat
La de da de da de da de da
Hair is dead skin particles

Volcanic rock can be dated reliably
Genotypes, phenotypes
And I will have my father's bald spot
