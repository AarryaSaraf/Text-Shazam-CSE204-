I just wanna stop and stop to see you
I just wanna stop and stop to see you
I just wanna stop and stop to see you

I just wanna stop and stop to see you
(I don't wanna stop and stop to see you)
I just wanna stop and stop to see you
(I don't wanna stop and stop to see you)
I just wanna stop and stop to see you
(I don't wanna stop and stop to see you)
