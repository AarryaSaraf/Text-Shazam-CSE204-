Act suspicious for me baby
Act suspicious for me now
Act suspicious for me baby
Act suspicious for me now

Act suspicious for me half time
Act suspicious for me man
Act suspicious for me mad time
Act suspicious for me man

Act suspicious for me baby
Act suspicious for me now
Act suspicious for me baby
Act suspicious for me now

I speak in monotone, leave my fucking microphone

Act suspicious
Act suspicious

I'm sick of being dead, everything is waking up dead

Act suspicious
Act suspicious
Act suspicious
Act suspicious

Whoa!

I made my head explode, end up on the glorious road
