I'm losing all my friends
I don't know where they're going to
I've got to get a job
I don't know how I'm going to

I'm losing all my friends
They won't talk to me anymore
Won't look me in the eyes
And I don't know what the fuck for

And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college

I've got to get a job
I'm gonna need some money
But how can I pretend
To be a decent human being

And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college

And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
I'm going to college
