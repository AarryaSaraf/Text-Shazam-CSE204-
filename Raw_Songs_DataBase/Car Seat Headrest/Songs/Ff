Fangface, I wanna hang with you but I
Should really learn how to talk
Fangface, really wanna hang with you but I
Should really learn how to talk

And I went to a show, just to get out of my head
And I didn't talk to anyone at all
And I went to a show, just to stop thinking of you
And I didn't talk to anyone at all

Fangface, did you not notice?
All the quiet obscure things
That I've been dropping for the past seventeen years
Fangface, I really love you but
Fangface, you just wanna eat me
And that is not such a healthy relationship
And speaking of love, honey I'm sick of this

I got startled
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
And it's all gone, it's all
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

And I thought I saw a star, but it was just a plane
And I thought I saw the moon, but it was just you
And I thought I saw a star, but it was just a plane
And I thought I saw the moon, but it was just you

Fangface, I should really learn how to talk
Fangface, I should really learn how to talk
Fangface, I should really learn how to talk
Fangface, I should really learn how to talk

(Stop it, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.)
