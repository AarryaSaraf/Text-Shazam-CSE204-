Step right up!
March!
Push!
Crawl right up on your knees!

Please!
Greed!
Feed!

I want a little bit
I want a piece of it
I think he's losing it
I wanna watch it come down

Don't like the look of it
Don't like the taste of it
Don't like the smell of it
I wanna watch it come down

All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?

Shove it up inside
Surprise!
Lies
Stains like blood on your teeth
Bite
Chew
Suck

I wanna break it up
I wanna smash it up
I wanna fuck it up
I wanna watch it come down

Maybe afraid of it
Let's discredit it
Let's pick away at it
I wanna watch it come down

All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?

The pigs have won tonight
And they can all sleep soundly
And everything is alright
