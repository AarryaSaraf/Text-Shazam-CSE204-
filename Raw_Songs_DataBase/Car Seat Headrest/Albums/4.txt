// A Good Bridge To Never Cross Until There's No Doubt That He's Dead //

The scar on my ankle [x4]
Looks like a sideways numeral 1
Like it's trying to be infinity
But it doesn't know
Only 8 is allowed to do that

Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go back there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there

The scar on my ankle [x4]
Looks like a sideways numeral 1
Like it's trying to be infinity
But it doesn't know
Only 8 is allowed to do that

Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
(Give him time to go up there)
Give him two weeks to go up there
(Give him time to go up there)

A good bridge to never cross until there's no doubt that he's
(Now there's the man who punched me
Oh look he's looking at me)
A good bridge to never cross until there's no doubt that he's
(Now there's the man who loves me
I think he's trying not to look suspicious)
Looks like a sideways numeral one, and he's trying to be infinity
(In our hallway, unless I look the other way
We have matching ties and this is cool)
But it doesn't know only eight is allowed to do that

Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
(Give him time to go up there)
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
(Give him time to go up there)

Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na [x4]

Give him time to go back there
Give him time to go back there
Give him time to go back there
Give him time to go back there

Give him time to go back there
(give him time to go back there)
Give him time to go back there
(give him time to go back there)

Give him time to go back there
(Give him time to go back there)
Give him time to go back there
(Give him time to go back there)
Give him time to go back there
(Give him time to go back there)
(Aaahh)
Give him time to go back there
(Give him time to go back there)
(Aaahh)

Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
(Give him time to go up there)
Give it some time
Give him two weeks to go up there
(Give him time to go up there)

La la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la

// Who Even Knows //

Can I blame whatever makes a noise
Makes me alone, makes me annoyed
Who even knows why my heart beats loudly
Who even knows why my eyes get cloudy
You are a palindrome spelled wrong
You need to give me back my mom
Who even knows that I'm good-hearted
Who even knows that I'm retarded

You won't listen to me
You won't watch my TV
You don't like my movies
Not at all
I won't come back to you again
I won't spend time with my friends
I won't talk to women
Not at all

You are a god in the machines
Screaming "death to all mankind"
Who even knows why I have no hair
Who even knows why my friends sleep bare
You are a palindrome spelled right
You and me want to sleep all night
Who even knows what I feel now and
Who even knows why my legs are tired

You won't listen to me
You won't watch my TV
You don't like my movies
Not at all
I won't come back to you again
I won't spend time with my friends
I won't talk to women
Not at all

We're adults
We can fight
We're up all night again
Don't be mad
At yourself
You should be mad at me

You won't listen to me
You won't watch my TV
You don't like my movies
Not at all
I won't come back to you again
I won't spend time with my friends
I won't talk to women
Not at all

// Even The Who Knows //

Can I blame whatever makes a noise
Makes me alone, makes me annoyed?
Who even knows why my heart beats loudly
Who even knows why my eyes get cloudy
You are a palindrome spelled wrong
You need to give me back my mom
Who even knows that I'm good hearted?
Who even knows that I'm free?

You are a god, In the machines
You are screaming, "Death to all mankind"
Who even knows why I have no man
Who even knows why the chance is dim
You are a palindrome spelled right
You make me want to sleep all night
Who even knows what I feel now and
Who even knows why my legs are tired

No windows, I'll forget how to fly
We can't go, I'll forget how to fly
Be inside, I'll forget how to fly
We can't fly, I'll forget how to fly

You are a palindrome spelled wrong
You need to give me back my mom
Who even knows that I'm good hearted?
Who even knows that I'm free?

// Not "Kidding" Around //

My fists are killing me
I've been using them too long on the arms of this seat
My fists are killing me
I've been using them too long on the arms of this seat

Snip snip snapping our credit card in twos and threes like a christmas wreath
The balance can't be helped keeping it in the freezer for the house

I hate my life I hate my ipod
I hate my life I hate my ipod

I was likening the experience of listening to you get anxious
And do like having me some strange ass similes
Describing the experience of listening to Kid A
And then not responding to my puzzled inquiries

Uhh oh my god

I opened up the birthday card and out fell a birth control pill
I opened up the birthday card and out fell a birth control pill

My wrist hurts so much
Draw another comic that no one will ever touch
My wrist hurts so much
I'll draw another comic that no one will ever touch

I was likening the experience of listening to you get anxious
And do like having me some strange ass similes
Describing the experience of listening to Kid A
And then not responding to my puzzled inquiries
You solve mysteries
Training my eyes to like the spotlight like it ain't bright
Histories unmissed miserys
Resting my eyes that don't ignite cause it ain't right

Oh my god I can't take this anymore

Did you hear me say that? did you? did you?
Did you hear me say that? did you?
Did you hear me say that? did you? did you? did you? did you?
Did did did you hear me say that? did you? did you?

I was likening the experience of listening to you get anxious
And do like having me some strange ass similes
Describing the experience of listening to Kid A
And then not responding to my puzzled inquiries
I was likening the experience of listening to you get anxious
And do like having me some strange ass similes
Describing the experience of listening to Kid A
And then not responding to my puzzled inquiries

Shake hands and wash hands and break hands and make cash and
Shake hands and wash hands and break hands and make cash and
Shake hands and wash hands and break hands and make cash and
Shake hands and wash hands and break hands and make cash and
Shake hands and wash hands and break hands and make cash and
Shake hands and wash hands and break hands and make cash and
Shake hands and wash hands and break hands and make cash and
Shake hands and wash hands

// Heartless Dick //

My knees don't take too much to break now
I lost the label with the info
Telling me how much I should take now
Before my final meal on death row
I was my own
I was my own
I was my own
I was my own

Like a special brand of the product
Would do the job better than this one
Is that any way to conduct?
I would laugh but I'd tell you that you missed one
I was my own
I was my own
I was my own
I was my own

// Dickless Heart //

Meals, I don't like meals
When you eat by yourself
No one else, fit, to, be, beside you
So I leave the TV on
When I eat my food
And it's like I have a friend

Does [?] eat the same
Can I rearrange what little things we are?
It makes me get so
Oooh, oooh, ooh ooooh, ooh-oooh

My eyes have taken a break now
But how could I, how could I, how could I, how could I forget?
I love the way you make me fearful/mess me up
But how could I, how could I, how could I, how could I forget?

Describe a [?]
Try to go and see another [?]
There's no [?]
Oooh, oooh-ooh, ooooh, ooh-oooh

Wake me up, a bezzled phone call
I can't talk but I'd like to know
Wake me up, a bezzled phone call
I can't talk but I'd like to know
Wake me up, a bezzled phone call
I can't talk but I'd like to know
Oooh, oooh-ooh, ooooh, ooh-oooh

Meals, I don't like meals
When you eat by yourself
No one else fit to be beside you
(But how could I, how could I, how could I, how could I forget?)
So I leave the TV on
When I eat my food
And it's like I have a friend
(But how could I, how could I, how could I, how could I forget?)

Does [?] eat the same
Can I rearrange what little things we are?
It makes me get so

Does [?] eat the same
Can I rearrange what little things we are?
It makes me get so
Oooh, oooh-ooh, ooooh, ooh-oooh

// Feel Like Daniel Johnston //

There's a guy who makes some tunes, so simple and so sweet
He makes me laugh, he makes me cry, his songs are pretty neat
He seems as though he is all alone, no lovers and no friends
But I'm afraid I'm gonna turn out like him in the end

I feel like Daniel Johnson
I feel like Daniel Johnson
Or is it "Daniel Johnston"?
Or is it "Daniel Johnston"?
I think it's "Daniel Johnston"
I think it's "Daniel Johnston"
I feel like Daniel Johnston
I feel like Daniel Johnston

There's a guy who makes these movies, always sad but true
He's always thinking about death and how he will die too
I'm a big fan of his films but I don't want to be
A neurotic just like him, thinking of the death of me

I feel like Donald Kaufman
I feel like Donald Kaufman
Or is it "Charlie Kaufman"?
Or is it "Charlie Kaufman"?
I think it's "Charlie Kaufman"
I think it's "Charlie Kaufman"
I feel like Charlie Kaufman
I feel like Charlie Kaufman

I've been asking all these questions, but I must confess
I've already resigned myself to sad sad loneliness
So I lock the door, throw away the key, and never face my fear
I got my music, got my TV, I think I'll just stay here

I feel like Daniel Johnston
I feel like Daniel Johnston
Or is it "Charlie Kaufman"?
Or is it "Charlie Kaufman"?
I think it's "Daniel Johnston"
I think it's "Charlie Kaufman"
I feel like Daniel Johnston
I feel like Charlie Kaufman

// The Ghost Of Bob Saget //

Last night I was haunted by the ghost of Bob Saget
He said "You're more or less than just a faggot"
So I put on a dress and followed him to heaven
But first I gave him a blowjob outside the 7-Eleven

The ghost of Franz Kafka came to me in a dream
He said that things are usually what they seem
So I put on my uniform and followed him to heaven
But first he pierced my ears outside of 7-Eleven

The ghost of my old man said "I like that beard"
He said "I always wanted to have long hair"
I said "Oh fuck you fuck you fuck you"
But he didn't even care

The ghost who violated me, he thought he was funny
He took us all to Disney World
He tried to make us watch him stand in an alley
With no one there except for the ghost

The ghost of some asshole summoned me to the office
He said "How come you didn't go to the office?"
I said "I was afraid that they'd make me feel dumb"
They said "You're being dumb" and shot me in the head

Did you know that birds and other various creatures
Have a window of time right after their creation
Where they latch on to whatever they see as their mother
And presumably the object of their sexual frustration

The ghost of Bob Saget haunted me yesterday
He said "Back up man, 'cause we know you're gay"
So I threw him in a river in the USA
Wherever I go is so fucked anyway

Death came in bending over like he was sick
Promised I'd be really bad at sucking dick
I had a gun painted in my hand
And Death said "Hey, do you want to be in my band?"

Today I got a package and it was my mom
She's called back up twice, I knew that something was wrong
She was missing her ring so I took out the scoop
And looked for half an hour through her ashes too

Last night I was haunted by the ghost of myself
I said "You're probably going to kill yourself"
He said that "When you do don't bother leaving a note
'Cause everybody knows just where you're going"

The ghost that I hated which came to me last night
Said kid in heaven everything ain't so right
So I took off all my clothes and followed him to hell
But first he waited fifteen years outside of my jail cell

// Around //

There is a vein
In my head
That will explode
When I'm old
I don't know
I just do what I'm told
That's what you said
That's what you said
My blood
Streets of 1994
My love
Lying naked on the floor
We don't talk any more
And I don't know why
Cause I'm really shy
But I hurt you, man
Do you even want me around

There's a bug
In my mind
That wakes me up
All the time
Back to sleep
But it won't keep
Until I find
That's what you want
My blood
Straight from an open wound
My love
Bleeds like it's addicted to you
But I still love you
But I don't want to
But I still do
But I'll help you, man
Do you even want me around
