// Tybee Island Horse Ghosts //

When I look at the sky at night
I can hear you laughing on your star
All the other stars laugh along with me
I can hear them from down there

When it's over all the lights go out
But let's stay and watch the credits
Let's move over a little and watch the sunset

Am I going mad?
I feel like walking into traffic
Oh shit I think I am
I need to learn how to be online

Eugene Debs was the socialist presidential candidate in the election between him, Taft, Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt
Nobody told me that my earbuds were exposed to the elements
And suddenly we're driving across the ocean [reversed]

// Happy / Ugly //

(You're not me, talk to me)

I like to smile, but I don't like to see my mouth
I like to laugh, but I don't like to hear me laugh
I like to dance, but I don't like to see me dance
I like to smile, but I don't like to see my mouth

Cause I'm so happy, I'm so ugly
I'm so happy, but I'm so ugly
I'm so happy, I'm so ugly yeah!

A straight shot
Just out
Night time
How's the writing done?

We sense, we see, we felt

Joe, Mike, Brandon, Ashley
Katie, Alex, Tim
And finally Joe, again sitting 'round the table
With their Poker chips

That's much less
Than the rest
Than the rest
Than the rest

Said "shut up" and took some pill
Didn't work made me feel ill
Said "shut up" and took some pill
Didn't work made me feel ill
Said "shut up" and took some pill
Oh my god I'm awake still

Up all night

Not in a good way

Oh my god I'm awake still

Said "shut up" and took some pill
Didn't work made me feel ill
Said "shut up" and took some pill
Didn't work made me feel ill

Oh my god I'm awake still

// Inside The Bell Jar //

This is all the fault, the fucking coffee house
The fucking coffee house

My phone did not ring
My name was not on the list
I was not invited
I did not make the list
My life did not come up
My doorbell made no sound
There were no taps on my shoulder
I did not not not not look around

I spent no money, yenom on tneps I
I drove no where, erehw on evord I
I saw nobody, ydobon was I
I did not care, erac ton did I

I was not burning the midnight oil
I had no one with which to grin ear to ear
I turned on the gas
And rested my head upon the racks of the oven

This is all the fault, the fucking coffee house
The fucking coffee house

// You Have To Go To College //

I'm losing all my friends
I don't know where they're going to
I've got to get a job
I don't know how I'm going to

I'm losing all my friends
They won't talk to me anymore
Won't look me in the eyes
And I don't know what the fuck for

And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college

I've got to get a job
I'm gonna need some money
But how can I pretend
To be a decent human being

And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college

And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
And I'm going to college in 5 months
I'm going to college
