// Does It Feel Good (To Say Goodbye?) //

I have been working
Working on something
Something you'll never see
It is a boat
It's almost done
There's just enough room for me
You heard the hammer and
You had the question but
Instead you just let it be
Cause it's been raining
Pretty hard and
You know we live right by the sea

Does it feel good to say goodbye?
Bye, bye, bye
Does it feel good, does it feel good to say goodbye?
Bye, bye, bye

I had a good friend
We had a good fight
We're not friends anymore
He cut me down
I asked him why, he said
"Hey man, that's what friends are for"
At the time I thought
He might be right
And it shook me to the core
I found out later
He'd just seen his ex-girlfriend
Just another vote for the war
Well, fuck you, man

Does it feel good to say goodbye?
Bye, bye, bye
Does it feel good, does it feel good to say goodbye?
Bye, bye, bye

// Famous Prophets (Stars) //

Apologies to future me's and you's
But I can't help feeling like we're through
The ripping of the tape hurts my ears
In my years, I've never seen anyone quit quite like you do

Twin bruises on my shins
From where I kicked the back of the seat in
They meant what I went through for you
But now they're fading, now they're gone

(Don't)
(Don't)
(Don't spend too much time on it)
(Don't)
(Don't spend too much time on it)
(Don't)

These teenage hands will never touch yours again
But I remember you
You had a body
You had hands and arms and legs and et cetera

Did I fail? Did I fall?
(In the morning when I wake up, are you mine?)
Did I waste my time, waste my time on a broken heart?
(Take the trash out like a bad dream, are you gone?)
Or is this the start of the great silence?
(From the old house, the fiercest heart spoke, are you mine?)
Is this the start of every day?
(Christmas tree's dead, you know how time flies, are you gone?)

I'm not gonna end up a nervous wreck
Like the people I know who are nervous wrecks
Though I'm not gonna name names
(Yours was an exception)
Did the sound just stop?

At the end of every day
There'll be nothing left to say
There'll be no backstage pass

We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)

We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
(Don't spend too much time on it)

Don't get too impressed
You might lose your breath
Don't predict your death
'Cause I like you the best

Don't you fall apart
You might lose my heart
You know I love your art

The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave

So descend into cliché
If you've found your holy grail
(The ocean washed over your grave)
I could fill back in that grave
I could hammer in that nail
(The ocean washed open your grave)
I could give you what you want
I could give you what you deserve
(The ocean washed over your grave)
I could sing another song
I could watch that hammer swerve
(The ocean washed open your grave)

And when the mirror breaks
I wouldn't miss it for the world
(The ocean washed over your grave)
Call it blackstar, call it painstar
The same thing happens when you touch it
(The ocean washed open your grave)
Let me tell you, did they tell you what happens when you touch it? Did they tell you?
(The ocean washed over your grave)
Let me tell you what happens when you touch it, let me tell you, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let...
(The ocean washed open your grave)

Let me
Let me in

So descend into cliché
If the music has forsaken you
Roll the stone over the grave
I never liked that one anyways
Or stare into the face
Of whatever it is that's facing you
And if the levee breaks
You'll find out what it is that's replacing you

And when the mirror breaks
I wouldn't miss it for the world
Call it blackstar, call it painstar
The same thing happens when you touch it
Did they tell you what happens when you touch it?
Did they tell you what happens when you touch it?
Did they tell you...
Did they tell me...

What happened to you?

Love... I gain nothing... I have love, I gain nothing... I have love...
If I give all I possess to the poor (all I possess to the poor) and give over my body to hardship (over my body to hardship) that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing... I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast... Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres...

My... be... ohh...
It'll take some time
It'll... it'll be
Aah-ooh-aah-ooh aah...
Don't see, don't see each other
We... we don't see, we don't see...
Aah-ooh-aah aah aah...
Somewhere... down the
Down the, down the line, down the line, down the line
-ch other, -ch other
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Ba-ba-ba-ba...

Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. At the end of my childhood, I put these ways behind me. For now, we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known
And now these two remain...

// Unforgiving Girl (She's Not A Single Version) //

What a glorious hell we have found until I recognize the sound
Of my voice again
For years I hadn't had a clue, but suddenly I can look through
Your eyes again

This isn't sex, I don't think, it's just extreme empathy
She's not my ex, we never met, but do you still think of me?

They say that the world is one, but if the world is one
How come you never come around anymore?
Well, I guess it's not that simple

Well, everyone learns to live with their sins
But girl you wear yours like a brand new skin
So take it all off
And let me back into your...

It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl

It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl

At least I don't think so

Welcome to the workshop
Lesson number one:
Nothing stays but the chorus
(Nothing stays but the chorus)
But she moves and
She speaks and
She's on a chain that moves towards perfection
Baby, the effects are so good these days
If there were gears behind those big brown eyes
I wouldn't be able to tell the difference

Now listen girl (yeah?)
Don't touch that dial
I'm gonna say that's one more time (yeah?)
Because I feel like we're both on the same page
And you know how rare it is for two human beings to be on the exact same page
At the exact same time
But still I gotta ask (yeah?)
We're dancing, right? (yeah?)
This is a dance, isn't it? (yeah?)

Well, everyone learns to live with themselves
And you're not the only one who's been through hell
So give me a sign that I'm not making love to myself

It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(Oh, that's right)
It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl

Aye!
It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl)
It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl)

// War Is Coming (If You Want It) //

Last night I dreamed that you'd murdered some kids
Gone up towards the border where the freaks live
I couldn't tolerate it, yet somehow I did
If it had been on TV I would've changed the channel
And afterwards I lay awake for quite some time
And thought about opinions I'd kept
At five in the morning I couldn't tolerate it
How many had died while I slept?

Now is the time to cast Darwin aside
Stop spinning lines that justify the lure of suicide
And reach out your hands
And save someone's life
Because war is coming
If you want it

She's keeping quiet in a season of crime
Walking away as if nothing had changed
From that awful display
People are strange
If they keep on laughing
Nothing will change

Now is the time to cast the screenplay aside
And try to create some space between the lines
To lift up your voice
And change someone's mind
Because war is coming
If you want it

// You Know There's Someone Out There //

Hey Jane Doe
Is this another one?
Where the lady dies
Because the man had a gun

Was he a card carrying getaway all along?
Was the SAG-AFTRA wondering where he'd gone
I wonder where he'd gone

You know there's someone out there
God I know there's someone out there too
For me and you
Not me not you
We will ride that dick again

You know there's someone out there
God I know there's someone out there too
For me and you
Not me not you
We will ride that dick again

You and I, are like two baby birds
Two birds who, know how to use words
The stranger would call the Car Seat, feel the hurt
We know exactly when it starts to hurt
Find the fish hook in the worm

You know there's someone out there
God I know there's someone out there too
For me and you
Not me not you
We will ride that dick again

You know there's someone out there
God I know there's someone out there too
For me and you
Not me not you
You can't take me anyway

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
