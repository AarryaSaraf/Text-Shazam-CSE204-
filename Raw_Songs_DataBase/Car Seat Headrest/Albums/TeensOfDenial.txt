// Fill In The Blank //

I'm so sick of (fill in the blank)
Accomplish more, accomplish nothing
If I were split in two I would just take my fists
So I could beat up the rest of me

You have no right to be depressed
You haven't tried hard enough to like it
Haven't seen enough of this world yet
But it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Well stop your whining, try again
No one wants to cause you pain
They're just trying to let some air in
But you hold your breath, you hold your breath, you hold it
Hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold it

I've known for a long time
I'm not getting what I want out of people
It took me a long time
To figure out I don't know what I want
So you'll ask "why?" and there will be no answer
Then you'll ask for how long? and there will be no answer
Then you'll ask "what can I do?" and there'll be no answer
And eventually you will shut up

You have no right to be depressed
You haven't tried hard enough to like it
Haven't seen enough of this world yet
But it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Well stop your whining, try again
No one wants to cause you pain
They're just trying to let some air in
But you hold your breath, you hold your breath, you hold it
Hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold it

I get signs
From the cops
Saying "stay the fuck down"
I get signs
From the audience
Saying "stay the fuck down"
I get signs
From God
Saying "stay the fuck down"

I've got a right to be depressed
I've given every inch I had to fight it
I have seen too much of this world, yes
And it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
And I will never see the light
That I've seen shining in your eyes
You just want to see me naked
So I'll hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold it
Hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold my breath
I hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold my breath

// Vincent //

And half the time I want to go home
And half the time I want to go home

For the past year I've been living in a town
That gets a lot of tourists in the summer months
They come and they stay for a couple days
But hey, I'm living here every day

I don't need the complications
I'm just in it for the beating
It's almost a point of pride
They say that it doesn't happen that often
Pure sadism
Pure sadism
Pure sadism
Pure sadism

I find it harder to speak
When someone else is listening

In the back of a medicine cabinet
You can find your life story
And your future in the side effects
I haven't played guitar in months
My strings all broke

They got a portrait by Van Gogh
On the Wikipedia page
For clinical depression
Well, it helps to describe it
Yeah, it helps to describe it
Yeah, it helps to describe it
Yeah, it helps to describe it
Yeah, it helps to describe it...

I don't have the strength
(I don't have the time)
I poured myself a drink
(I told myself a lie)
You know I've worried
(You know I've tried)
Don't you know I'm not strong?
(Don't you know I'm not kind?)
Someone's getting lucky
(Someone's calling the cops)
Someone takes me away
(Someone make it all stop)
I had a bright tomorrow
(I spent it all today)
Now I am silent at last
Now I have nothing to say

If I'm being honest with myself
I haven't been honest with myself

It must be hard to speak in a foreign language
Intoxicado
Intoxicado
Intoxicado
Intoxicado
Intoxicado
Intoxicado

I find it easier to sleep
(And half the time I want to go home)
When I'm not holding the noise machine
(And half the time I want to go home)
And half the time, I'm like THIS -
They'll send in Matt. CAPtain Trash!

I don't have the strength
(I don't have the time)
I poured myself a drink
(I told myself a lie)
You know I've worried
(You know I've tried)
Don't you know I'm not strong?
(Don't you know I'm not kind?)
Someone's getting lucky
(Someone's calling the cops)
Someone takes me away
(Someone makes it all stop)
I had a bright tomorrow
(I spent it all today)
Now I am silent at last
Now I have nothing to say

// Destroyed By Hippie Powers //

I am freaking out in my mind
In a house that isn't mine
My end goal isn't clear
Should not have had that last beer

It' s more than what you bargained for, but it's a little less than what you paid for
My bowtie's come undone, my microphone hangs limp on the mic stand
Tell my mother I'm going home, I have been destroyed by hippie powers
Tell my mother I'm going home, I have been destroyed by hippie powers

That guy I kinda hate is here
Shouldn't have had that last…WHOOO!! HIT OF DMT!!!!

What happened to that chubby little kid who smiled so much and loved the Beach Boys?
What happened is I killed that fucker and I took his name and I got new glasses
Tell my mother I'm going home, I have been destroyed by hippie powers
Tell my mother I'm going home, I have been destroyed by hippie powers

// (Joe Gets Kicked Out Of School For Using) Drugs With Friends (But Says This Isn't A Problem) //

I get to know myself every weekend and I'm weak

Hangovers feel good when I know it's the last one
Then I feel so good that I have another one

Last Friday I took acid and mushrooms
I did not transcend, I felt like a walking piece of shit
In a stupid looking jacket

I walked around town and thought I was in Sodom
There were filthy people seeking comfort for their bodies
It was so obscene

Filled with loathing and religious fervor
I laid on my friend's bedroom floor for an hour
And tried not to piss my pants

And then I saw Jesus

And he said
"Who are you to go against the word of my father? And
Who are you? the scum of the earth"
No we are just, we are just, we are just teens of style
Oh we are just, we are just, we are just teens of style

There were people getting drunk, there were people getting high
They were falling to pieces right before my eyes
And I said "mmhmm" a lot (mmhmm)

And there was one guy there who kept asking me how does it feel (are you sure)
And I didn't even know how to begin to answer that question (you don't want to talk about what you're experiencing)
So I just said I don't want to talk about it (and I just said no)

So there I was, just another shitbag civilian
Afraid of the cops when I was outside, afraid of my friends when I was inside
And I grew tired of the scene
And then my dad showed up

And he was like
"Who are you to go against the word of our fathers?"
"Who are you? the scum of the earth"

No we are just, we are just we are just teens of style
No we are just we are just we are just victims of the contemporary style
Yes we are just we are just we are just we are just going along with the modern style
Now everybody, everybody, everybody's going along with the modern style
Let's do it together
It goes:

Drugs are better, drugs are better with
Friends are better, friends are better with
Drugs are better, drugs are better with
Friends are better, friends are better with
Drugs are better, drugs are better with
Friends are better, friends are better with
Drugs are better, drugs are better with
Friends are better, friends are better with
Drugs are better than friends
Are better than drugs
Are better than friends
Are better than drugs
Are better than friends
Are better than drugs
Are better than friends
Are better than—
Drugs are better, drugs are better with
Friends are better, friends are better with
Drugs are better, drugs are better with
Friends are better, friends are better with

// Not What I Needed //

I have nothing but questions
I need answers, those would fill me up
I know when I'm being catered to!
I know when I'm being catered to!
I will not settle for the lowest common denominator!

Hello my friend, we've been waiting for you for a long time
We have reason to believe that your soul is just like ours
Did you ever get the feeling you were just a little different?
Well, here's our web page, you've finally found a home

Good people give good advice
Get a job, eat an apple, it'll work itself out
It's a phase (It's a phase!)
It's chemistry (It's chemistry!)
It's your own fault (It's your own fault!)
Well don't listen to us
We're just people too

I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting for some real good porn
Something with meaning
Something fulfilling
I'd like to make my shame count for something

I feel so empty trying to explain this
His name is William Onyeabor, he's from the 70s
And when I wake up in the morning
There are people sleeping on my couch
Well, I'll have something to say about that one

Free people give free advice
Let go of the pain, let go of the fear
But if I let go of that
What will still be here
Will I find out
That I am just people too?

Should I say that one more time?

Um, yeah, I mean, uh, the intent was to sort of go back to these periods and, and revisit them a little bit, especially with Teens of Style. You know, with Teens of Denial it was sort of contemporaneous when I was writing it. You know, and what I was experiencing at the time. And, uh, I guess I was just out of my teenage years when I was writing things for Teens of Denial. I didn't really feel like anything had changed. So, um, yeah I guess, you know, the two of those albums together are sort of, they're both an exploration of past feelings and how they connect to the present and what I'm doing in the present tense

I'm sorry, you'll have to say that again
The connection must be bad. Um, can you try one more time?
Ahh. Um, when I was starting out, I, uh, recorded vocals in my car sometimes, uh, just for the sake of privacy

// Drunk Drivers / Killer Whales //

In the backseat of my heart
My love tells me I'm a mess
I couldn't get the car to start
I left my keys somewhere in the mess

It comes and goes in plateaus
One month later I'm a fucking pro
My parents would be proud
Or fall asleep on the floor
Forget what happened in the morning
There are notes in your handwriting
But you can't make it out

We are not a proud race
It's not a race at all
We're just trying
I'm only trying to get home
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers
This is not a good thing
I don't mean to rationalize
Or try and explain it away
It's not ok
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers

It's too late to articulate it
That empty feeling
You share the same fate as the people you hate
You build yourself up against others' feelings
And it left you feeling empty as a car coasting downhill
I have become such a negative person
It was all just an act
It was all so easily stripped away

But if we learn how to live like this
Maybe we can learn how to start again
Like a child who's never done wrong
Who hasn't taken that first step

We are not a proud race
It's not a race at all
We're just trying
I'm only trying to get home
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers
Put it out of your mind
And perish the thought
There's no comfort in responsibility
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers

It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this

Here's that voice in your head
Giving you shit again
But you know he loves you
And he doesn't mean to cause you pain
Please listen to him
It's not too late
Turn off the engine
Get out of the car
And start to walk

Drunk drivers
Drunk drivers
Drunk drivers
Drunk drivers

It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this

It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this

Whales...
Whales... ah yeah yeah...
Whales... oh ho ho ho... oh oh

// 1937 State Park //

(I never thought it would happen to me but…)x2

No one should ever have to look at themselves

I steer clear of graveyards
They are cliche
In my death-obsessed generation

No one should ever have to look at themselves

High school teen dream dies in the hospital
Leaves behind a journal and a pair of Air Jordans
Lyrics of popular rock ballads
Changed to include his name

I'm taking back my heart
You were digging a hole for it six feet deep
(at the state park, at the state park)

I didn't want you to hear
That shake in my voice
My pain is my own

And when the cops shook me down
I cried walking home
I cried walking home

You and me are connected now
We were in one photograph and we don't even look happy
I can't commit to a crime to commit
I need to get one done for the biography because

When I split the scene
Leave the party early
What am I leaving behind me?
Just a memory
Another body
It ain't no pair of Air Jordans

Something is ringing
Death is playing his
Xylophone ribs for me

I didn't want you to hear
That shake in my voice
My pain is my own

And when the cops shook me down
I cried walking home
I cried walking home

Don't worry
I'm worrying for two
So don't worry baby
Don't worry
I'm worrying for two
So don't worry baby

// Unforgiving Girl (She's Not An) //

What a glorious hell we have found until I recognize the sound
Of my voice again
For years I hadn't had a clue, but suddenly I can look through
Your eyes again

This isn't sex, I don't think, it's just extreme empathy
She's not my ex, we never met, but do you still think of me?

They say that the world is one, but if the world is one
How come you never come around anymore?
I guess it's not that simple

Well, everyone learns to live with their sins
But girl you wear yours like a brand new skin
So take it all off and let me back in
To your…

It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl
It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl

Welcome to the Welcome Center
Make a U-Turn
My phone is freaking out
I'll lose my shit while it re-routes but
She moves and
She speaks and
She's on a chain that moves towards perfection
Baby, the effects are so good these days
If there were gears behind those big brown
Eyes, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference

Oh, girl
You know you got to be forgiving in a world like this

It's a small world
And you know you got to come see me sooner or later
Girl you know I know...

Alright now listen girl (yeah?)
I'm only gonna say this once
I just need to make something... make sure...
I just need to make sure of something
And I feel like we both know it
I just wanna ask:
We're dancing, right?
This is dancing

Well, everyone learns to live with themselves
And you're not the only one who's been through hell
So give me a sign that I'm not making love to myself

It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
It's an unforgiving world
It's an unforgiving world
But she's, she's not an unforgiving
(It's an unforgiving world)

That's it, I like that one
Fuck you

// Cosmic Hero //

If you really wanna make it last
You could commit yourself completely
You could lie down in the river at last
And let the dread complete you
And if you really don't want the pain
You can disengage completely
Because it wasn't healthy anyways
And you've got a job and a family

If you really wanna fall asleep
Then you'll have to find some punctuation
And if you wanna ride it out to the end
You can tie your thoughts together
And if you really wanted to be kind
You'd have forgiven them a long ass time ago
And if you really wanna know how kind you are
Just ask yourself why you're lying in bed alone

I know you wish my flesh would yield
I love you but I can't stand the touch
And of course I'm alright with death
But why you talk about it so goddamn much?

I will go to heaven
You won't go to heaven
I will go to heaven
I won't see you there (x4)

If you really wanna know yourself
It will come at the price of knowing no one else
This guy, he was so high
I asked my friend to punch him out
Can you kick his ass?
Can you kick his ass for me?

And if you really wanna make the change
Then you would cut yourself off completely
But if you just want it to be ok
It will never be ok

It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright (fuck)
It'll be alright (fuck you)

Now you gotta change addresses again
If they knew where the fire was they'd put it out
Someone's knocking on your door
Fire turned towards me with an open mouth

And if you don't come home tonight
You will never call it home again
And if you need some peace and quiet
There is room for all in heaven

I will go to heaven
You won't go to heaven
I will go to heaven
I won't see you there
I will go to heaven
You won't go to heaven
I will go to heaven
I won't see you there

// The Ballad Of The Costa Concordia //

I used to like the mornings
I'd survived another night
I'd walk to breakfast through the garden
See the flowers stretching in the sunlight

Now I wake up in the mornings
And all the kindness is drained out of me
I spend hours just wincing
And trying to regain some sense of peace

If only I could sustain my anger
Feel it grow stronger and stronger
It sharpens to a point and sheds my skin
Shakes off the weight of my sins
And takes me to heaven

I stay up late every night
Out of some general protest
But with no one to tell you to come to bed
It's not really a contest

Maybe you think
I'll learn from my mistake
But not this time
It's just gonna break me

If only I could sustain my anger
Feel it grow stronger and stronger
It sharpens to a point and sheds my skin
Shakes off the weight of my sins
And takes me to heaven

And if I've lost you for good
Could it have been any other way?
Was the water filling up for years
Or did I wreck it all in a day?

I'm going to bed now
I've sunk into my sorrows
And it'll take three hundred million dollars
To get me up tomorrow

I won't go down with this shit
I will put my hands up and surrender
There will be no more flags above my door
I have lost, and always will be

It was an expensive mistake
It was an expensive mistake
My horse broke his back to get me here
I have his blood on my hands for no reason
But what was I supposed to do?
How was I supposed to know how to use a tube amp?
How was I supposed to know how to drive a van?
How was I supposed to know how to ride a bike without hurting myself?
How was I supposed to know how to make dinner for myself?
How was I supposed to know how to hold a job?
How was I supposed to remember to grab my backpack after I set it down to play basketball?
How was I supposed to know how to not get drunk every
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and — why not — Sunday?
How was I supposed to know how steer this ship?
How the hell was I supposed to steer this ship?
It was an expensive mistake
You can't say you're sorry and it's over
I was given a body that is falling apart
My house is falling apart
And I was given a mind that can't control itself
And I was given a ship that can't steer itself
And what about the pain I'm in right now?
And what about a vacation?
And what about a vacation to feel good?
My horse broke his back and left me here
How was I supposed to know?
And God won't forgive me
And you won't forgive me
Not unless I open up my heart
And how am I supposed to do that
When I go to this same room every night
And sleep in the same bed every night?
The same fucking bed
Red comforter with the white stripes
And the yellow ceiling light makes me feel like I'm dying
This sea is too familiar
How many nights have I drowned here?
How many times have I drowned?

I give up

Let us take you back to where we came in
We were united, an undivided nation
We got divided, it was something inside us
And it was not us

We were so naive, we were just like animals
Told what to believe by the beasts who took control
We wanted control too, but that was normal

Cause our life was one of survival
The decisions we've made, if you can call it deciding
With your life on the line, it'd be social suicide to change your mind

So we got mad and we split the scene
Now we download all of our shit for free
It's the new economy, we have nothing to offer and we sleep on trash

I give up

Let us take you back to where you came in
A man clinging to the cliff of revelation
So scared of what he would find, he started crying
"It was not me"

Stopped at the borderline they took his disguise
So he read a book that won a Pulitzer prize
It was about death
It didn't help
He saw himself in it

And he was disturbed at the conclusions it led to
But he couldn't say what because the author was dead too
And so though he made fun of us, he has now become one of us

I give up
I give up
I give up
I give up
I give up

And you wake up trembling
From a dream where I swam into the river
I reach out and hold you in my arms
I love you, I love you, I love you

// Connect The Dots (The Saga Of Frank Sinatra) //

Little boy says I'll be in love with my fists
Little boy says I'll be in love with my punches
Little boy says what should I do with my hands mom?
Little boy is told not to do anything wrong

When I die I'll be taken to the constellations
Have a drink, relax, there'll be some introductions
This is Cassiopeia, this is Orion
This is Cindy, this is Nathan
That's Chrissy and the other Nathan

I know that it's a lot to remember says mother
I know that it's a lot to remember says father
I know that it's a lot to remember says mother
I know that it's a lot to remember says father
I know that it's a lot to remember says mother
I know that it's a lot to remember says father

I speak these words in utter isolation
I drive the car in a line from star to stardom
Little boy says I'll touch the heart of the nation
Little boy says I'll punch the heart of everyone

When I die I'll be taken to the constellations
Have a drink, relax, there'll be some introductions
This is Cassiopeia, this is Orion
This is Cindy, this is Nathan
I just met him, no that's the other Nathan!

I know that it's a lot to remember says mother
I know that it's a lot to remember says father
I know that it's a lot to remember says mother
I know that it's a lot to remember says father
I know that it's a lot to remember says mother
I know that it's a lot to remember says someone

You won't see who you want to see there
No one will want to be in your band
You'll have to learn how to make it on your own
Spend a little time with your own hand

(we were heroes back home
We are heroes back home)

Little boy says I'll be in love with my fists

And we're never gonna never gonna get a job [x4]
FUCK...OFF...TEENS!!!!

// Joe Goes To School //

I saw a horse and it saw me
You know their skulls are so crazy but they still can see
It had big brown eyes, shining and sad
It was just a horse, I couldn't tell if it was sad or not

I held out my hand like there was something in it
Managed to touch it, it did not seem interested
Then a car pulled up, so I split the scene
I am a tourist attraction biking down DoG Street
