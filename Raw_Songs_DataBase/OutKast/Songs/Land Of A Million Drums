In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home


In the land of a million drums
I catch a pattern that spit rings around you like Saturn
Intergalactic tracks I make 'em like magstrulium
This one for scooby, pass the doobie I'mma do me one, do me one
Only you clean over
I pick up the mic and rock it while I'm sober
For the rated G exposure if you listen what I'm trying to told ya
We fathers with seeds of our own
We're talking about sons and daughters boy, not roots and clones
Now that the theory gone wrong
An embryo with no soul
Stuck in this green mini-van with my lungs in a chokehold
Shaggy pass the boombastic
Daphne said don't do that
Freaky Fred smashed the gas and slammed us into traffic
Now Scrappy wanna box and throw them bows
So I had to sic the pit bull on him before he could pass one blow
Scooby-doo, scooby-doo, scooby damn doo, scooby doo (Scooby doobie doo)


In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home


Woke up from a long night of hanging out with Shaggy
Oh no, lost my last baggy of scoobie snackies
Shaggy, wake up, we've been had
Our Scooby snacks, they got the whole stash
He said, "Who, who?"
I don't have a clue
I suspect the thirteen ghosts of Scoobie Doo
Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel
Tell him to send another package right through the mail
In the meantime, I'ma call Velma to tell her
To get the Mystery Machine ready
I'm two-wayin' Daphne and Freddy
Me and Shaggy dressed in all black, strapped
Dippin' through the flash trying to get our stash back
Rounding up suspects, collectin' clues
I got a question, where the hell is Scooby Doo when you need him?
The hound's only found when you feed him
In fact he probably got my sack
Tell him holler back


In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home


Break it down, break it down baby 'til the flow jumps off the ground
Ooo break it down lookin' over yonder 'til the walls come tumbling down
Ooo, yes lord y'ain't gotta tell me two times but you know I know
Ooo, break it down, break it down baby 'cause I want y'all all to know
We rock the world


In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

I coulda got away with it, if it wasn't for ya meddling kids
(Oh oh, oh no)
