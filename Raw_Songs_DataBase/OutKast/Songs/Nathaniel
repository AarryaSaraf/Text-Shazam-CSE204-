Shit man
Nigga gotta go on and god damn
Get the shit straight when I god damn get out
Well shit
This what really going down

Whassup my nigga another day the same shit
Punk-ass C.O.'s on a nigga dick
Got me up at three o'clock cooking eggs n' grits
I'm a G from C.P. I can't take the shit
Trying to hold a nigga down in this country ass town
I'm used to smoking chronic moving pounds
They got a nigga on some "Sir, yes sir, left right left"
Throw me in the hole if my ass outta step
They treat you like a motherfuckin' slave
Dope fiends find Jesus, swear they saved
Niggas better get they game tight
'Cause these crackers trying to take a nigga life and they rights
I'm surrounded by fake-ass crooks
They swear they kingpins but don't have money on they books
I hear so many lies it make me sick
These niggas called ballers selling dimes and nicks
I can't wait 'til the day they let me go
So I can eat some steak and shrimp
Grab a mic, and bust a flow
I'm Audi 5 nigga lights out
Hold it down on the streets until the day that I get out

I'm out man
