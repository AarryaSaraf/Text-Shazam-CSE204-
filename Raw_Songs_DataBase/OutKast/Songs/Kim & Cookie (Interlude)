And now, Kim and Cookie

 Ring-Ring
 Say hello Cookie!
 Hello
 Girl, I got something to tell ya
 Spill it girl, spill it
 Remember ol' boi, at the club
 From last night?
 Last night!
 What's up?
 Went home with the motherfucker, now I'm thinking I'm fittin' to goddamn get my ass to' up!
But girl
 What?
 Dick so short!
(Short!)
He came quick, he got his, I ain't get mine, I'm like: fuck!
(Fuck!)
You know you talkin' all that goddamn shit and you ain't shit!
 Girl, you got you a motherfuckin' minute man!
 A minute motherfucking man
(Motherfucking minute man!)
But it's all good you hear me? 'Cause before I goddamn left this motherfucker
I hit this motherfucker up for everything, you hear me!
I'm talking 'bout wallet, I'm talking 'bout credit cards, money
And you know what, I was gonna hit the motherfucker up for his goddamn pistol
But I ain't know how many motherfucking bodies he had on, that motherfucker, you feel me!
(I feel ya!)
 Well it's all good

(Break!)
