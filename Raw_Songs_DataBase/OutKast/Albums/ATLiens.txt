Album: ATLiens

// You May Die (Intro) //

Nada de novo vem do sol
Tudo de novo vem do nosso senhor
A vida é uma continuação
O nosso senhor é que dá a nossa vida, ámen

You can be sure
Some go low to get high
You may hurt till you cry
You may die (You may die)
Keep on trying (Keep on trying)
'Til it's summer, in the city
'Til it's summer, in the city

// Two Dope Boyz (In A Cadillac) //

Greetings, earthlings

[Big Boi:]
From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing
Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Every time I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good 'cause see it go good with them flows, bwoi
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, 'cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers

[André 3000 and Peaches:]
Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from? South Coast slums
It's just two dope boys in a Cadillac
It's just two dope boys in a Cadillac

[André 3000:]
This ol' sucka MC stepped up to me
Challenged André to a battle and I stood there patiently
As he spit and stumbled over cliches, so called free-styling
Whole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilding
I say, "Look, boy, I ain't for that fuck shit—so fuck this"
"Let me explain 'only child' style so you don't dis'"
I grew up to myself not 'round no park bench
Just a nigga busting flows off in apartments

[André 3000 and Peaches:]
Now who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from? South Coast slums
It's just two dope boys in a Cadillac
It's just two dope boys in a Cadillac

[Big Boi:]
It goes Broughams to the Fleetwoods, Coupes to De Villes
Hitting Girbauds and off these flows we having the player chill
In this atmosphere this ain't no practice here
We cutting the fool now
I'm doing ya at the house and throwing you out because I'm through now
Don't you love the way we claiming Bankhead, stankhead
Looking around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted
Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselves and stop

[André 3000:]
Yeah, tight like nuts and bolts, sluts and hoes they get evicted
I'm dealing with Queens in my castle—ain't worth it to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the projects
Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex
Or no diamond; at the exit with a sign saying "We'll rap for food"
My face is bawled up 'cause I ain't in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the Windex
'Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax error
Bring the terror to your dome like PE
Prone to finish this out 'cause this be a freestyle

Now who them boys that be having the crunk every occasion?
This side niggas dustin', that side niggas lacin'
But in the middle we stay calm
We just drop–

// ATLiens //

[Big Boi:]
Check it
Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
"Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit"
Bend corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern player serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucker that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving the shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

[Big Boi and Andre 3000:]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

[Andre 3000:]
Now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothing better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate-us 'cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?
Now everybody say

[Big Boi and Andre 3000:]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

[Big Boi:]
Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, 'cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me

[Andre 3000:]
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody gots to play their part
God works in mysterious ways, so when he starts
The job of speaking through us, we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol, so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away, I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition, so I'm ready for war, okay

[Big Boi and Andre 3000:]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

// Wheelz Of Steel //

[Big Boi:]
Ugh
As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
I'm finna enhance your brains, check it out

[Big Boi and André 3000:]
Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Point didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the store
Caught a player slipping
But now I lay it to the floor just like carpet
'Cause I got the heat in my baby momma name now
Never bragging just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad, I learned my lesson
Never talk to strangers in the trap and answer questions
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons 'cause we don't sell dope
That you distribute
We don't contribute to your clandestine activity
My soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate—liars and thieves; they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they coil

[André 3000:]
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

[Big Boi and André 3000:]
It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up, I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, no claps, or no rabies
Yeah, we take no shit, like, ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand four
But not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve
Tryna take you other people 'fore your rims at the curb
'Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go 'head, go 'head
More head for me, while you ride to the beat
Drop, like tears, like For Fears, you know
Shout, shout, let it all out, just for my peers
And peoples who feel it's time to unwind
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine

[André 3000:]
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

Okay, like this, yes, yes
One time for my boys doing King shit
Two times, too legit and it don't quit
Three times for my folks in the drop top
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop
One time for my girls doing Queen thangs
Dead fresh to the T, eating chicken wings
Three times for my girls in the beauty shop
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop

Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel

// Jazzy Belle //

[André 3000:]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yes, I love her like Egyptian
Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boy because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I'm going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I'm willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it's real Jazzy Belle

[Big Boi:]
See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes
I see your weapon and it's depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch, don't play me 'cause you're janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southernplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don't even know yo name
It's a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I'm leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don't get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you'll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb
And Dumber, yeah, you know what I'm saying

[André 3000:]
See me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to hurl, 'cause most of the girls
That we was liking in high school, now they dyking

[Big Boi:]
Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be, I know she's sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her

[Khujo Goodie:]
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank

// Elevators (Me & You) //

[André 3000:]
One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago, on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil, and plus, my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like "Freeze!" We making the crowd move
But we not making no G's and that's a no-no

[Big Boi:]
Check it, a-one-two, a-one
"Two dope niggas in the Cadillac," they call us
Went from "Player's Ball" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say "motherfuck that playin'", they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise"
Over a million sold to this day; niggas, they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
I'm out this bitch

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys, bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses, passes getting thrown like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, "Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick, and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now"
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82
Me and you like Tony! Toni! Tone!
Like this, East Point and we gone

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

[André 3000:]
Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something "Hey, man, you remember me from school?"
"No, not really"
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, "What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made"
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you

// Ova Da Wudz //

Something's gotta give!
Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Uh
Herndon Homes, unh, Martel Homes, Carver Homes, Techwood
Martin Luther King, Bankhead

[Big Boi:]
Undercover, over the hills and through the woods I go
Like green lights, a Southern nigga that's comin' for your throat
But not no guillotine see, we be them Southern playas
Remember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs, now
You up to par and ready for your lesson
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-Cities High School, was pulling 'em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and laying em down was just a habit
Just like Smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talking about the clique will get you Nathaniel but swolled up
Hootie Hoo slapped you boys across the cheek with Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell 'em Big Boi did it; I swear that nigga be rhyming
Every lyric that he spit be turning charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls
Girl, when you giving up them drawers, 'cause
I got a couple of niggas down the hall
That wanna hit it too, I'm not the type to be acting selfish
Set it out and let it out and I'll be right back just like Elvis
'Cause the postman rings twice
Hey Mr. Postman

[Witchdoctor:]
Power, power, I come, gimme some
The deadly voice over drums, we from, ATL
Put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
Let's travel far, tha Southern star shines
Power, power, I come, gimme some
The deadly voice over drums, we from, ATL
Put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
Let's travel far, tha Southern star shines

[André 3000:]
Everybody wanna get signed, but (I'm here to tell you)
Record companies act like pimps
Getting paid off what we made when we the ones that's fly like blimps
But ain't no Goodyear, I tell it like it is so I'm like look here
Just willing to get what I deserve, my kids do have a mother
And a little house, with a dog in the backyard going "woof-woof"
Who knows what I must face when I leave this recording booth?
Poof, back in the real world where birds fly
From Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high
There's clouds of clowns, seas of Gs
Projects, packed with playas meditating on their knees
Just to make them ends meet, like ground beef, you won't believe
The shit that niggas attempt 'cause they got other mouths to feed
Besides they own

[Witchdoctor:]
Power, power, I come, gimme some
The deadly voice over drums, we from, ATL
Put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
Let's travel far, tha Southern star shines
Power, power, I come, gimme some
The deadly voice over drums, we from, ATL
Put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
Let's travel far, tha Southern star shines

[Big Boi:]
It's some hoes in this house, damn right
I'm thinking about the way you skull me, girls be
Sucking me dry like deserts Mojave, Gotti, hotties and honeydips
Liking the way you do me, screw me and make my money flip
Shaking that ass for daddy, putting this gas off in my Cadi-llac
Back, don't ever snap, packing the gats and pimping whores
Hors d'oeuvres, swerve, hit the curb because I'm reckless
Back in the days when I was broke I'd snatch your fucking necklace
You ol' pussy-ass nigga... yeah

// Babylon //

[André 3000:]
I came into this world high as a bird
From secondhand cocaine powder—I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted, but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges without no snap-back
And bitches, they say they need that to shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route, turn each other out, burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me can't even get no backrub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part?
But let me hold it down, 'cause they shut you down when you speak from your heart—now that's hard
While we ranting and raving 'bout gats
Nigga, they made them gats they got some shit that'll blow out our backs from where they stay at

[Andrea Martin:]
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping (Hoping), wishing (Wishing), praying
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith)
In you, in you

[André 3000:]
I'm fascinated by the way your nipples peak at me through your blouse
Freaky me, freaky you can't help but be a-roused
'Scuse me, Lord, lustful thinking, but that's the way we was brought up
Sneaking to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods and laid with the squirrels
During P.E., we'd be exploring each others privates
Hunching with all our clothes on until we felt excited then (Aah)
Oh, now it's on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere if you know what I'm talking about
Now if too harsh then walk on out and I'll see you on the next song
They call it horny because it's devilish, now, see, we dead wrong

Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith in you)
In you (Oh, ooh)

[Big Boi:]
People don't know the stress I'm dealing with, day to day (Day)
Speaking about the feeling I'm possessing for Renee
Moping around and wondering where she stay, saw her last that she lay
Give it another day, I say, but the Lord, he taketh away
Now give it back, Lord, 'cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor store, crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Living up on this earth before a nigga like Daddy was born
But they be making it seem that my music and crime are a team
But I'm speaking the truth not dreams
So what in the fuck they mean, my lyrics ain't clean?

[Andrea Martin:]
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone (So I keep hoping)
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying (Praying)
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith in you)
In you
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you (My faith in you)
In you
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here, someday, we will be gone (I keep hoping)
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you

My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you (Keep my faith)
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith—

// Wailin' //

[Big Boi:]
In the zone like Keyser Söze, always the Usual Suspect
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And Southern pride, I'd be, checking my fucking head
Scared, looking up in your face, boy, I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be
Enemies in the P's, freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs
Only the twenty piece mojo, flows on like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could your hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breakin'
Never baking, rebuking Satan, we had you waiting
For the Second Coming, funny how time flies when you're rhyming
LaFace Records, I think they got that perfect timing
To be doper than Saddam, believe the Nation of Islam
Fuck the police and the dogs, sniffing that dope up out your car
I think they overstep they boundaries
Huh, OJ, not guilty, that's how they found he

[Cee-Lo:]
Mm, yeah, mm, mm
Mm, yeah, mm, mm
Mm, yeah, mm, mm
Mm, yeah, mm, mm

[André 3000:]
I felt the pressure like sun shining, while raining
At the same time, I kept on rhyming, not complaining
Storm braining cats and dogs, my catalog be the size of golf balls
Throw up your Daisy Dukes I'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs
And Rosco P. Col' people, who caboose my locomotive
But enough of that, everyone can rap but let's say gift, suppose if
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I
Compose, won't y'all get sick of that, 'cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that ain't hip-hop, you find that shit in the gift shop
But to each his own, my speech is born
Keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy, then I'm happy
Even if you just hate my fucking guts, go 'head and dap me
'Cause I'm gon' dap you anyway
And then go home and pray for your ass later
'Cause we might need you in this war, I'm wailing on you traitors
Like that

// Mainstream //

(Water splash)
Uh, y'all know what it is
Uh, y'all know what it is
Uh, y'all know what it is

[T-Mo Goodie:]
Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken
Words of a change I don't feel but I see
Visions from me at 23
Making it free in my community
One day is what I live for
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it 'til I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes 'round comes 'round from M.L.K. to Cascade
I know it's through them plenty figures
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now it's quarter kis, stacking Gs
In the South Indies
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
Off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
The block hard to get by the dope dealing
Fatal killings, and fed time, to writing rhymes
It ain't just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took
Thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes it's just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream

[Khujo Goodie:]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

[André 3000:]
They swan diving
As if they name be Gretchen von Ivan
Volkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them
Lost dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?
Be rhyming "catch of the day" when the recipe calls for "blackened"
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Of them greens and it's enticing how them Jones's sing
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch their rim, if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down and then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names 'cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are
But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly 'cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Face down, face down, face down

[Khujo Goodie:]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

I let you stay in my crib
Now you know where I live
When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal
Look at the hand you deal
Me crudball business, niggas giving inches, so here, take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours
Process sm-m-moking like Jerry
Meanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to attain another level of conscience
Only to test, the potency
Why laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed
Deceased with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny
But one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say
"I wish I never did what I did," now face this bid
It was the company you kept, the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10
They got you niggas where they want you again
Floating face down in the mainstream
That's why, that's why, that's why

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

[Big Boi:]
Everybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their head
Thinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about yourself
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family, up and down like hoes give head
To dicks, oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique, bitch
Oh, what, you want me to call you slut?
Then why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts
But see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits
In the mix, flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

[Khujo Goodie:]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

[Cool Breeze:]
I call the crib they say "Breeze, you ain't know?"
I say "What?" "Big Time got popped in his Benzo!"
I said "Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus
I'm 'bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell 'em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talkin' 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry 'bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in...naaah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
'Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who owe us a dime
It's the 'great ho 'round up yo' money' time
I got to have mine, then I'm outta here!
Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier
Ain't got to worry 'bout yo' partner getting caught like a lame
It won't be over 'til that big girl from Decatur sang"
(It won't be over 'til that big girl from Decatur sang!
East Point police don't know a damn thang...)

[Big Boi:]
Yeah, it won't be over, check this out
Can you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep?
Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak
About that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit
Looking up in your face, I see a coward and a dimwit
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Serving a warrant to a baby daddy who didn't come to court
On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping
Leaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six
Buying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
'Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long
Staring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysittin'
Y'all don't know nothin' 'bout Big Boi, 'cause that nigga steady dipping
It ain't over (why that? why that?) 'til the bitch open her mouth up
And sang

[Big Gipp:]
Took me a long time to get here
Long time, man
I'm talking about, years, and years
Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag
Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumping Lily, to lilypad dag
Looking to get my Goodie feel
I'm broke in like some old men
Who'd stop dem or would stop
I'm dropping lines for the big plot
Sixteen is when I started this dream
It's ninety-six I'm in your face
Can you hear that bitch scream?

(It won't be over 'til that big girl from Decatur sang...)

[André 3000:]
Me and everything around me is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse, but now I'm pacin' back and forth
Inside, I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem too long
I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say "amen"
I hope He understands I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say "forget it"
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and, like Riddick
Bowe, I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
"It's just a phase, it's gon' all pass", but that gets old too
I'm weakenin' like a deacon doing dirt
What am I s'posed do?

[André 3000 and ShaJuanna Edghill:]

Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (It's who you are)

[Big Boi:]
See, from bed knobs to broomsticks, we lookin' to start some new shit
I'm writing this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it
My nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new sense
Wiping away your germs and filling your craniums with juices
See, Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on
Straight from West Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home
Never go wrong, 'cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito, now we goes, "I'm proud of you people
For selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white, not black"
Shit, on the real, that's how them mighties really act
When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we fallin' apart
You lookin' me in my eye, but you ain't feelin' me in your heart
Yes, yes, Lord, give me the power, we live in the final hour
These niggas, they leavin' me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower
Now or never, let's stick together and overcome
But they don't feel like marching, 'cause they shoes is overrun
Ain't that a bitch?

[André 3000 and ShaJuanna Edghill:]

// Extraterrestrial //

[Big Boi:]
Peep what I say
Everyday the sun sets just like clockwork
To put the Glock to work
And putting the body to standstills
Man it kills me
Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss, niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging
Thinking they Steven Seagal and balling
Falling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen
When we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
Still yet they tend to flex, like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing, no-no, not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme
So fuck that country shit, we done a bunch of shit
And yes ya heard of this out of this world like E.T
Coming across ya T.V
Extraterrestrial – straight from ATL

Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world

[André 3000:]
Right now I'm smiling, taking advantage of this moment
Cause there might not be another soon
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars
Tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker
But to you I may appear to be your average Joe
But little do you know that even Joe got problems that he gots to joust with
Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things
Maybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing
Keeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring
We like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring
Extraterrestrial, out of this world

Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world

// 13th Floor/Growing Old //

[Big Rube:]
Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level—what are we doing?
Fooling ourselves, clowning ourselves, playing ourselves
By not being ourselves
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get off meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mind-numbing reality of horror
Known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon it
Just face this mind state
Otherwise Babylon

[Debra Killings:]
Like memories of yesterday

"Ninety-six gonna be that year"
"Ninety-six gonna be that year"
"Ninety-six gonna be that year"
"Ninety-six gonna be that year"

[André 3000:]
I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want, but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain
Or can I? I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it
I'm confessing one more lesson from the South, we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at
The Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen
Started by Afrika Bambaata, so you and your partner
Gather your thoughts

[Debra Killings:]
Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday

[Big Boi:]
Uh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi
It's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy
I'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps
And throwing them craps
7 Eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas but watching your back
For the robbing crew; thinking they're robbing you, you must be cautious
To staying up on your game and pimping these crows, you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat, but fucking these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know if I wanna be playing
But running up on me like you miss me
You catching the wrong vibe, packing your shit and rolling your eyes back
Flexing up on the corner tossing your dice and rolling your Cadillac
But man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga
Don't expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger
As we bust, us, we leaving em in the dust
So keep that caine up out of your nose
I said my piece and then I hush
As the calendar keeps flippin', niggas dippin'

[Debra Killings:]
Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday

[André 3000:]
Our dearly beloved, we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh, like Liberty Bells, yes them bullets keep on ringing
On fire like the Georgia Mass Choir, we keep on sanging
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen
Psych, because no one is free when others are oppressed
So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old

[Big Boi:]
Like some eagles, people don't understand
Just like their parents don't be caring
I'm speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinking you got it but get it, get it but you ain't pimping no bitches
'Cause you flauging; falling like leaves into driveways
Isn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old

[Debra Killings:]
Something's gotta change

See all them leaves must fall down, growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown
Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old
See all them leaves must fall down, growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown
Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old
See all them leaves must fall down, growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown
Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old

// Elevators (Me & You) - ONP 86 Mix //

[André 3000:]
One for the money yes uh two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just trying to find that hookup
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go around trying to catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes trying to find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we making the crowd move but we not making no G's
And that's a no no

[Big Boi:]
Yeah, uh, check it
Ah one two, ah one two doe, niggas
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say motherfuck that playing, they paying
We stay in laying vocals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yeah them niggas they making big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
Ninety-six gon' be that year that all y'all player haters can bite me
...around this bitch

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors

[Big Boi:]
Back in the day when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullshit, pull shit
Off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was, stoned like white boys
Smoking them white golds before them blunts got krunk, chunky asses
Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's and they looking like Halle Berry
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me Lil B, Greet, Mon and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, mama I want to sing but
Mama I want to trick, and mama I'm sucking dicks, now
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like eighty-two
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Like this Eastpointe and we gone

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors

[André 3000:]
Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way
That I just came from, some nigga was saying something
Talking bout "Hey man, you remember me from school?" smoke some
Naw not really but he kept smiling like a clown
Facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, what kind of car you drive, I know you paid
I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I had been going through the same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check
If you don't move yo' feet then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck
Yes we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop so we just gonna continue

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
