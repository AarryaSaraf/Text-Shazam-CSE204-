You know how I get down
But look I'm just gon' keep it real

I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your make-up

Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up

Calling my ex-girl or e-mailing my mama (Damn)

And I know if I see you guaranteed it's going down

She just oblivious to the whole shit like
And you know like I was saying sometimes

With the slit at the top so
I can tear it easy and all that
