Lady, you say I stay in the house 'til four
We don't even go out no more
It's always the same eh
Always complaining
It's obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see there's a lot to lose
'Cause we got a baby
And people are shady

My generation is changing
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at

Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next
Lend me ya Kleenex
I'm telling you baby
I think I'm about to cry
Still gotta go out tonight
'Cause I gotta feed you
I hope that I see you again... again
Hope that I see you, see you

Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on Pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing R&B singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'Specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, that's how the world is
That's how niggas putting they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'Specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coinciding? Not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, it's hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spitting
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
