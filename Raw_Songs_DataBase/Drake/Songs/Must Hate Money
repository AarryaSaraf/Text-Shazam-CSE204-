I've got it made that's what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride

Check, I wish y'all could've seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, fresh Js, new pants
Back when "fuck bitches, get money" was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doing things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on today's to-do list
'Cause he rolling with more squares then you would find up on a Rubic's
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That Prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
'Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single

If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm what's wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker (so)
I'm in that big boy 550 S-Class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass I'm riding new in 2008 (say what)
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white Gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the grain and sit on seats that's made of cashmere
Five karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch there's a whole lotta rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writing letters to the pen for my brother Irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swerving
Hotter than a bitch rock, cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My Cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If being fly against the law bitch call the police

If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm what's wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

Stacks on deck, 'lac's mounted on Ds
I don't trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once it's all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad 'cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
It's my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to Rome and I just wanna take her
I'm trying to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in Jamaica
I say, 'Baby, get low,' you just getting by
They hating 'cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit it's a damn shame homie I don't even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply

If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
