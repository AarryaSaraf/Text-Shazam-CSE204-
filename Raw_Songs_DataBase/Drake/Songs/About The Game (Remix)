It's Southern Smoke Boy!
Ho, yeah, uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
A ha ha ha, the boy of summer are here man
Ayo Track, I got something mean for this one boy

Chances are most of the day you was lying around
I made money that's why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem desitend for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled
In I take Qs from my big boy pops
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copping some vows for the bar
Get it guess not picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me
Now a day I peep they interests
Specially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scapegoat
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a
This knowledge if you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money then lovers separate for I commit the date up
I put a split in the middle then I separator

It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coop of my truck
Baby it's about the game

Ridin' low
Laid back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
That's it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coop of my truck
Baby it's about the game

It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game

The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)
