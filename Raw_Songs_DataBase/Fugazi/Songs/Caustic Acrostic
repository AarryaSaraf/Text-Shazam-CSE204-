Lights out for the cynical sharps

For their wide-eyed foils and all attendant props

Supporters of flash and pan-fried fucks

Who grease like cops throwing round their weight

And I feel dangerous and vexed

Swinging two ton second guess

And every motion just cuts too cruel too cruel

And the implication is that you're implicated

Like a caustic acrostic spelling out your name

Lights out cos I can see in the dark

Sidewind my way to the mark of fuse lines

Gas-wet for a spark

I crash I burn I've fully lost it anyway

And you're nowhere

Lights out loser
