Ahistorical -

you think this shit just dropped right out of the sky

My analysis:

it's time to harvest the crust from your eyes

To surge and refine, 

to rage and define ourselves 

against your line

So sorry friend, you must resign


You want to figure it out

we'll throw down, we'll throw down, we'll throw down

You want to figure it out 

well throw down your bulldog front


Bold bold mouth talking not so bold 

now that you've eaten your own

Lips flecked, mouth specked 

you strip the skin right off of the bone

But I would never say 

you act without precision or care, but

it's all attention to armor, 

to the armor you wear so well 


You want to figure it out

we'll throw down, we'll throw down

You want to figure it out 

we'll throw down your bulldog front


You want to figure it out

You want to figure it out


Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home


Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home


You want to figure it out

we'll throw down and we'll throw down

You want to figure it out 

we'll throw down your bulldog front


You want to figure it out

You want to figure it out
