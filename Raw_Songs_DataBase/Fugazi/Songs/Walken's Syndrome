Fragile stem

Asleep at the stoplight again

Red dressed in red drenched in red spreading red ever red

Fragile stem

Veering for control again

Change lanes explain how strain defers the impact of speed

On on past gone gone gone past on

Fragile stem

Made your own road again

Scars crash and glass made

You laugh you'd show it off to your friends

Fragile stem lay down your arms and then

Steer into the headlights like the dead light of the last sun you'll see

Steering into headlights and your gone
