Here's an all new version

Teeming with distractions

Trojan horse rolled backwards

Mastered buy your own device

Then splice in then cut to the sad sorry image of some grinning 'caster

Staring at a sinkhole

Piling up disasters

Making the footage raw

Now parade the muscles

Trying to make their dicks grow

Warring with their bodies dimensions oversold

"I wonder if I pierce it will my body stop lying to me?

Now mouthing mile a minute

Blasting like a furnace

Fogging up the lenses with the dampness of spew

Loss of concentration

Loss of obvious

Laws of stimulation

Signed anonymous

It's a stock set up

Man check it out!

A well worn cop's shoe's kicking out a door frame

Classwar extra

Pr-ing like a foreman's dog

"What a slob but I guess you know

He's got to make a living somehow"

Tossing a wild eyed greaser right onto the pavement

Scanned into the bright light maxing the pixels to glow

How did it come to mean nothing but this?
