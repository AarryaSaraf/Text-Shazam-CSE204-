I want to go
I want to get out
All guns are loaded
And have gone off now
I'm channeling 17 dead revolutions
That have long gave up the ghost
One drink of water and I'm drowning
The space between the dime and the dollar
The space between the city and the suburb
Some kid took another kid
Pumped him full of holes
Just to see a new horizon
One drink of water and I'm drowning in it
Not alright
Downed city downed city
Two and two sawed in two
