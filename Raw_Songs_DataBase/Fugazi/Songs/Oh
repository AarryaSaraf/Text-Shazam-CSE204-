Number one in acquisitions now there is no foreign soil go global
Like a round thing go global like a hole to every
Money matchmaker splicing green as fast as you can
Let's break it down and
Start again memo to the partners I'm changing all the locks
I'm pissing on your modems
I'm shredding all the stock chose a colour for your ceiling
I'm waiting for the bottom to drop in a room so brightly lit I can't see in
You would never say you were out of time coming with the fiction all the
Time but there's a call coming on the other line your secret's out lapse of
Luxury lapping waste cruising towards a bruising crash thread held
Anvil's going to break when the letter returns to the sender I can hardly wait
God this room's so brightly lit I can't see shit thank you sir may I have
Another? I will be your eager driver your service provider your
Maitre'd thank you sir may I have another please?
