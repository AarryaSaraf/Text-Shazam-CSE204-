The sun came up

The sun came out

The sun did us in

The sun came out and tore us up

It ripped the shit out of our behinds

We drove home on towels off the heat of the seats

With sand in our teeth alright

Down on the ocean down on the sea

Water and wave under me

We're not brave but we're down for

the count alright
