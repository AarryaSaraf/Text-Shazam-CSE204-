Hey what's your name?

Do you feel the same way too?

Siphon fuel don't make a sound

And most of all don't let me down

It comes as no surprise

We're destabilized

Lock eyes shared plan

No c.i.a. could understand

Defile define critique and salve

No c.i.a. no n.s.a.

No satellite could map our veins
