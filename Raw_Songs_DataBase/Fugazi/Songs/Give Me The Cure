I never thought too hard on dying before
I never sucked on the dying
I never licked the side of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying
You've got your hands over your ears
You've got your mouth running on
You've got your eyes looking for something
That will never be found - like a reason
Good god I don't need a reason
I never thought too hard on dying before
I never sucked on the dying
I never licked the side of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying
But you've got to...
Give me the shot
Give me the pill
Give me the cure
Now what you've done to my world
