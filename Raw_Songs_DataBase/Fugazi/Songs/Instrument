That one is predetermined

That one, it finds another

This one comes in one window

Sliding out the other

We need an instrument to take a measurement

To find out if loss could weigh

We need to know value

We need to place value

In case it all comes true

Could it be loss could weigh?

It's always they that's dying

But now it's we that's dying

So sooner comes the trying to understand that loss could weigh

We've been dragged through the fire

We bragged about that fire

But suddenly we're tired

Could it be that loss could weigh?

Loss could weigh
