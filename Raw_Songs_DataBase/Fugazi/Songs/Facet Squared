Pride no longer has definition

Everybody wears it, it always fits

A state invoked for the lack of position

Strength is the bait that keeps us so busy

If it's perforated, then I tear it to bits

All sense lost in the frenzy

They should never touch the ground

Irony is the refuge of the educated

Always complaining but they never quit

Cool's eternal, but it always dated

They should never touch the ground

It's not worth, it's the investment

That keeps us tied up in all these strings

We draw lines and stand behind them

That's why flags are such ugly things

That they should never touch the ground
