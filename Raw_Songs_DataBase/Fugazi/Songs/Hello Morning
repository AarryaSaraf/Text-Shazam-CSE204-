Hello morning and the morning sun

Lights up the damage that the damage's done

Send a message you can understand

We're time capsules in a garbage can

Shelved with things we used to use

A box of candles with the wicks removed

A battery chambered with corrosive rust

A sealtest box with its top ripped off

You made your bed but now lie in it

Hello evening from the waning world

Where things still breathe and colors turn

But the tracks of what you used to know

They're no longer running under you

A well made bed

Now lie in it.
