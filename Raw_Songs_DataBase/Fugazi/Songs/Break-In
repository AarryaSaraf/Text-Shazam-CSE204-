And he's happy because she's got skin

And she's happy just to let him in

When he asks will you let me in?

And from a place where they share skin,

They say come inside and he's happy because she's got skin

And it's sweet when she let's him in,

No sin but there's a time when the skin wears thin

And she's working on another skin deep inside deep inside break-in

And he wonders will my money, will it cover for me

Can i stay outside and let it cover for me?

She can't get outside, she can't get outside

She's the covering
