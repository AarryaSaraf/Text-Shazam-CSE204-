Down at the station

We question our rations

Wut you seem satisfied with the little recieved

Fractured appetite with bismuth pink on tap

Ascetic limbs gone tight and your lips are clamped and grey

Crash your appetite erasing every mark you make

Standing in the corner while you're working up your mantra

'derail the train the train the train derail the train'

Take the time to hesitate

While what's glistening on your plate

Goes dry and cold and not in your mouth

Alright you see your programmatic mind surrenders appetite

And you crash yourself all over the place

Snake ingest 40 times their body weight

But you you emaciate

You crash your shit all over the place now

Open your mouth!
