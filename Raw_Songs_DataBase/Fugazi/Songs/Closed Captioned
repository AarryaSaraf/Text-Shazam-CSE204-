Your etiquette

Your rules on interaction

What are you waiting for?

Nobody's home we're all out trying to find one

What are we waiting for?

The recipe a clear connection the time the time the time the time

The direction we just want we don't know

This one wants the art this one wants the politic

Everybody wants their own damn station

If we're so fine maybe you can tell me why

no one counts until they're dead

I asked you, I asked you a question,

I just want I don't know

The imperfections are here to find if your position is so unkind

Everything is not alright

And since we live in present tense the only hope of making sense

All depends on the source of light

Everything is closed captioned so come one
