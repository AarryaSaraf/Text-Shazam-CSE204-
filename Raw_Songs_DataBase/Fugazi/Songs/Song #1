Song number one is not a fuck you song

I'll save that thought until later on

You want to know if there's something wrong?

It's nothing. everybody's talking about their hometown scenes

And hurting people's feelings in their magazines

You want to know what it all means?

It's nothing.

Fighting for a haircut?

Then grow your hair

Crying for the music?

I doubt you really care

Looking for an answer?

You can find it anywhere

It's nothing.

Life is what you want it to be

So don't get tangled up trying to be free

And don't worry what the other people see

It's nothing.
