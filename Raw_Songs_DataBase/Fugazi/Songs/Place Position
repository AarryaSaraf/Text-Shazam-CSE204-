All origins are accidental

You've got no papers and no roads lead home

Anymore

Chance is the root of all place position

All maps are random all scales are wrong

Legal illegal no passion for the difference

Legal illegal false premise forge the nation

May all your borders be porous

Free transmission smear genetics

C'est la vie yawn yawn yawn

I can't stifle my boredom

So why not act your age

Fear of contagion the violence of a fence builder's dream

That masks the phrasing of "all the pleasures of home"

Legal illegal

I want to go home
