Out here I can barely see my breath
Surrounded by jealousy and death
I can't be reached, only had one call
Dragged underneath, separate from you all

This time I've lost my own return
In spite of everything I've learned
I hid my tracks, spit out all my air
Slipped into cracks, stripped of all my cares

I'm so tired sheep are counting me
No more struggle, no more energy
No more patient and you can write that down
It's all too crazy and I'm not sticking round
