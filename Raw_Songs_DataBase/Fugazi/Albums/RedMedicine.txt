// Do You Like Me //

Your eyes like crashing jets

Fixed in stained glass

But not religious

You should pay rent in my mind

Say like the french say bon soir regret a demain

Do you like me I guess

White witness moves to petition the state of virginia for 27 prisons

While in bethesda an office flaming youth group singing

Firemen calling in

Lockheed lockheed martin marietta

Do you like me I guess

End of the lesson time for one question

End of the lesson time for one more question

I got a question.

Do you like me

// Bed For The Scraping //

I'm sick with this I'm sick with this

Situation avoided or just missed?

My own sweet time says it's ten twenty four

Hardly recognise simple things anymore

I don't want to be defeated

This is the point

This is the manifest

Bed for the scraping

Dirty little secret

Reason for the gathering consequence

What else is there to do

But go outside and look around look around

// Latest Disgrace //

I am a message prescient forecasting

There is a limit so take my temperature

You say "your turn" but I think the invite's open to all

So come on take your medicine

Hey doctor heal yourself or do you got too much to lose

You are a message precious extracting forging a tactic

To get your motion through

You say "don't know not sure"

But i think no holster's empty for you

So come on take your medicine

Hey doctor heal yourself

Or do you got too much to lose

Shoot out and shoot out the window

// Birthday Pony //

This is a birthday pony
This is a strange kind of rest
Because I feel like a guest when I'm right here at home
I'm not right here at home
I opened up these accounts
All these separate accounts
Because I can't comprehend the single ride to the end
I needed something to do and so I split into two
But now the pattern takes hold
I find I'm losing control
Laugh boy
I don't want to be free
This is a birthday pony

// Forensic Scene //

In your memory not so gentle

Perversify slash sentimental

Caught between and caught without

I'm a failure not your failure now

In and out just like a knife would tax the flesh and leave a cheap wound

Fucked and fucking love and lay

Congenitally fractured anyway

Unclipped unclean this forensic scene's all played out

The defense rests and sorry's just a no shit sherlock mouth talk con job

From your memory to this instant worked so hard for working distance

Like a mouth too late to shut

I'm a failure not your failure now

// Fell, Destroyed //

Here's a list of side effects

Practice tested

Covering every malice angle

For example you will sleep forever

You will never sleep again

Yawn to yawn your face is born to mask the shade of shit you're in

Now it's time to fake resignment room assignment

Next door to the generator

What the fuck it is

Whatever powers lights to burn all night

Your teeth to grind to grind so fine

You'll find out sooner what it is

To ring the alarm or you're sold to dying

Fell, destroyed and long out used step into it

Green in laying water blue

Cop a feeling coprophagics

Say next in line well how about you

Freedom's fiction sorry fifteen time to sell the softer shoe

Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying

(respects to tenor saw)

// By You //

Generation fuck you to define and redefine

You'd make them all the same but molds they break away

Safely inside looking outside go keep on picking at it it's just going to get bigger

Not yet an also-ran the note left in your hand is by you

Asked to cease and desist what aggravation preordained

It feels so good laying down

I won't ask to get up again

Where's my life you're in control like you don't know

Don't say you're along for the ride

Sitting down when you should stand

The line is in your hand

and it's by you

Hand over hand over hand

// Target //

It's cold outside and my hands are dry
Skin is cracked and I realize
That I hate the sound of guitars
A thousand grudging young millionaires
Forcing silence sucking sound
Forced into this conversation
So I say shine let their planets collide
This is the darkening down of my mind
We could be making it oiling like crime
We could be making it staking last dimes
If you want to sieze the sound you don't need a reservation
The torch is pased it's yours to return
Lay at their feet now use it to burn
For marketing the use of the word generation
A false alliance of money persuading
Forcing silence sound sucking
Forced into this conversation
Now if you want to sieze the sound you don't need a reservation
So open so young so target I can smell your heart you're a target

// Back To Base //

Autonomy is a world of difference

They're creeping round but they know they can't come in

Back from the front with observation it's still there

Across from me an extreme example

Bringing you what they want twenty four hours a day

Whole lot of not but it's convenient pray for fire

They'll tell you anything

It's speculation pure speculation

Bringing you back to base

// Downed City //

I want to go
I want to get out
All guns are loaded
And have gone off now
I'm channeling 17 dead revolutions
That have long gave up the ghost
One drink of water and I'm drowning
The space between the dime and the dollar
The space between the city and the suburb
Some kid took another kid
Pumped him full of holes
Just to see a new horizon
One drink of water and I'm drowning in it
Not alright
Downed city downed city
Two and two sawed in two

// Long Distance Runner //

The farther I go the less I know

One foot goes in front of the other

It all boils around to not hanging around

To keep moving in front of the gravity

The answer is there the answer is there

but there is not a fixed position

It keeps moving along so I keep coming along

and that's why I'm a long distance runner

and if I stop to catch my breath

I might catch a piece of death

I can't keep your pace if I want to finish this race

My fight's not with it

It's with the gravity

Long distance runner
