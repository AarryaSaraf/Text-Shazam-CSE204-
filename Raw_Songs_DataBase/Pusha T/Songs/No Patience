Pusha
Hoo


They noddin' and dozin'
They sit there frozen, in awe
The train track scars on their arm
All because the stamp on the bag wasn't charged
The same thing that took down DeBarge
Get it off the barge, floatin' through the waterways
Didn't need Italians, now they got a war to wage
When the product's pure, you're the one they oughta pay
Sugar Hill sweet, like his daddy-daughter days, yeugh
The line around the corner like Six Flags
The potency of one of mine equal to six bags
I done watched brothers kill brothers for nick' bags
The dope lean have a nigga parked like a kickstand
I'm the Bump Johnson of rap, Harlem Renaissance
I provide the fix, and y'all live on, son
The secret's in the mix, I sell it a la carte
I peddle everything you want, motherfucker


I ain't got no patience (Patience)
This clip and this barrel guaranteed to make you famous (Goddamn)
Man, we make you brainless
The mask, the gloves, god damn, man, I'm dangerous (C'mon)


Needles, noses
Dosage after dosage
Until the cell closes
'Til the casket gets filled with the ghosts
On the face that shows no emotion
I'm sellin' love potion, Chanel No. 9
The sins camouflage, but it ain't hard to find
Poppy flowers are a gold mine
Poppy guaranteed, up until the goal line, woo
On every corner like a stop light
Makes it hard stayin' out the spotlight
Numbers up and down, you better shop right
It's a vest and two guns when we shop nights
Hell up in Harlem, lotta problem solvers
Lotta dope dealers, lotta money launderers
Real go-getta, if you ain't know, nigga
We came to put locks on blocks to show niggas


Hey, I ain't got no patience (Patience)
This clip and this barrel guaranteed to make you famous (Goddamn)
Man, we make you brainless
The mask, the gloves, god damn, man, I'm dangerous (C'mon)
I ain't got no patience (Patience)
This clip and this barrel guaranteed to make you famous (Goddamn)
Man, we make you brainless
The mask, the gloves, god damn, man, I'm dangerous (C'mon)
