Sellin' cocaine in the open air
The boats is there
The notes is there
Yeah, the ropes is there
You ready

Out on the balcony
Goats and shit
Just got the word that the coast is clear
So I'mma send it down the coast and load it there
Imagine hangin' on a prayer knowing dope's in there
All that frontin' in your raps, you holdin' where?
We turnin' on the lights, you roaches clear
Parking lots, cemetery his ghost is there
Independent how I feel, the chauffer's there
Why would I do a turkey drive, then troll the mayor
When we feed the projects for most of the year
See my heart been black, ain't no hope in here
And we been let down by who's supposed to care
Me and Steven, gold wings, see those is rare
Ain't no Tony's in my circles, we Sosa's here
In these ten crack commandments, I'm Moses yeah
ARs do your body like folding chairs
Sit down

Sellin' cocaine in the open air
The boats is there
The notes is there
Yeah, the ropes is there

Bricks like blocks of government cheese
Seven hundred for the Japanese dungarees
VVS V12s don't fuck with my Vs
Highest price hood bitches that scuff up they knees
Finally made your first million but what's it to me
Million dollar dog collar I'm pluckin' you fleas
See none of those barkin' can fuck with the tree
And when they legalize that, the discussion's with me
Paris Le Meurice, The sprawling suite
His Cartier, her wrist Van Cleef
Exes deceased
AKA rest in peace
Her mother's worst fear is you die in the streets
Seventeen mind changes up under my seat
Jean-Georges reservations I'm dyin' to eat
Then we toast with Sancerre, a sigh of relief
Watch you niggas blow it all just trynna compete

Sellin' cocaine in the open air
The boats is there
The notes is there
Yeah, the ropes is there
