Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make-believe, rappin' 'bout my own life
(Woo) That's rare, nigga (Woo) Ric Flair, nigga
(Woo) The power's in my hair, nigga
(Woo) I give this beat the chair, nigga

SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes, trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit, ungrateful niggas I don't like
Rrrah!

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Bang bang)
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Bang bang)

(This Chicago, nigga)

They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I'd never hit a woman, never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep, I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eatin' good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissin' girls, 'cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on, then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hangin' out the window, it's 'bout to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man, that nigga nice
Shoutout to L-E-P, Jay Boogie, right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Right now)
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Right now)
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Right now)
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
Don't like (Like) don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
(Young Chop on the beat)

Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like
Smokin' on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screamin', "Sosa, that's that nigga that I like!" (Sosa)
I don't want relations, I just want one night (One night)
'Cause a thirsty bitch, that's that shit that I don't like (Nah)
I got tats up on my arm 'cause this shit is life (That's life, tatted)
And I stunt so much in clothes 'cause I'm livin' life (Life, Louis, Gucci)
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealin' light
Bitch, I'm high off life, got me feelin' right (300)
Bitch, I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch, we GBE, we just go on sight

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Right now)
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Right now)
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Chief Keef)
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like (Chi-Town, D-Town, you know?)

Whoa, we are not one and the same
Nigga, I'm fuckin' insane, fuck is you sayin'?
Yo' ass been doin' the same
Shit, not doin' what you sayin', dang
I told yo' old bitch she was fuckin' a lame
Turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holdin' that pain
I just hope you been prayin', bang bang
Ridin' for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these low-lives
And I run this bitch like it's no lights
Goin' hard the whole night 'cause I ain't goin' back to my old life
I promise

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Right now)
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Nah)
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Right now)
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

I done sold purp (Purple), I done sold white (White)
Runnin' outta work, that's that shit I don't like (Nah)
She never let me hit (Nah), she gave me dome twice
She blowin' up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em, just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother thirty for the Jesus (Uh-huh)
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
