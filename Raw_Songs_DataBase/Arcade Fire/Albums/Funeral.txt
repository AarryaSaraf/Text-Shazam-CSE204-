Album: Funeral

// Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) //

And if the snow buries my...

My neighborhood


And if my parents are crying,

Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours

Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours


You climb out the chimney

And meet me in the middle

The middle of the town

And since there's no one else around,

We let our hair grow long and forget all we used to know

Then our skin gets thicker from living out in the snow


You change all the lead sleeping in my head

As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn...


Then, we tried to name our babies

But we forgot all the names that,

The names we used to know

But sometimes,

We remember our bedrooms and our parent's bedrooms and the bedrooms of our friends

Then we think of our parents...

Well, whatever happened to them?!


You change all the lead sleeping in my head to gold

As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn

It's the song I've been trying to sing...


Purify the colors, purify my mind

Purify the colors, purify my mind

And spread the ashes of the colors over this heart of mine!

// Neighborhood #2 (Laika) //

Alexander, our older brother

Set out for a great adventure

He tore our images out of his pictures

He scratched our names out of all his letters


Our mother should've just named you Laika...


Come on, Alex. You can do it!

Come on, Alex. There's nothing to it!

If you want something, don't ask for nothing!

If you want nothing, don't ask for something!


Our mother should've just named you Laika...

It's for your own good

It's for the neighborhood...

The neighborhood!


Our older brother bit by a vampire

For a year, we caught his tears in a cup

And now we're gonna make him drink it

Come on, Alex. Don't die or dry up!


Our mother should've just named you Laika

It's for your own good

It's for the neighborhood...

The neighborhood!


When daddy comes home, you always start a fight

So the neighbors can dance in the police disco lights


The police disco lights

Now the neighbors can dance!

The police disco lights

Now the neighbors can dance!

// Une Annee Sans Lumiere //

Hey! The streetlights all burnt out.
Une année sans lumière
Je monte un cheval
Qui porte des oeillères

Hey, my eyes are shooting sparks,
La nuit, mes yeux t'éclairent
Ne dis pas a ton père
Qu'il porte des oeillères

Hey, your old man should know,
If you see a shadow,
There's something there.

So hey! My eyes are shooting sparks,
La nuit, mes yeux t'éclairent
Ne dis pas a ton père
Qu'il porte des oeillères

Hey, your old man should know,
If you see a shadow,
There's something there.

Hey, give it to her.
She's in love, give her!
She's in love, come on give it to her!
Give it to her, come on give it to her!
Give it to her, come on give it to her!

// Neighborhood #3 (Power Out) //

I woke up with the power out
Not really something to shout about
Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans

I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are swingin' from the power lines
Nobody's home, so nobody minds 

I woke up on the darkest night
Neighbors all were shoutin' that they found the light 
"We found the light!"
Shadows jumpin' all over my walls
Some of them big, some of them small

I went out into the night 
I went out to pick a fight with anyone
Light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid! 

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans
Growin' up in some strange storm
Nobody's cold, nobody's warm

I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are dyin' out in the snow, 
Look at them go, look at them go! 

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

And the power's out 
In the heart of man
Take it from your heart 
Put it in your hand

What's the plan? What's the plan? 

Is it a dream? Is it a lie? 
I think I'll let you decide
Just light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid! 

'Cause nothing's hid
From us kids
You ain't foolin' nobody 
With the lights out!

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

And the power's out
In the heart of man
Take it from your heart 
Put it in your hand

And there's something wrong 
In the heart of man
Take it from your heart
Put it in your hand

Where'd you go?!

// Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles) //

I am waitin' 'til I don't know when, 

cause I'm sure it's gonna happen then. 

Time keeps creepin' through the neighborhood, 

killing old folks, wakin' up babies 

just like we knew it would. 


All the neighbors are startin' up a fire, 

burning all the old folks the witches and the liars. 

My eyes are covered by the hands of my unborn kids, 

but my heart keeps watchin' 

through the skin of my eyelids. 


They say a watched pot won't ever boil, 

well I closed my eyes and nothin' changed, 

just some water getting hotter in the flames. 


It's not a lover I want no more, 

and it's not heaven I'm pining for, 

but there's some spirit I used to know, 

that's been drowned out by the radio! 


They say a watched pot won't ever boil, 

you can't raise a baby on motor oil, 

just like a seed down in the soil 

you gotta give it time

// Crown Of Love //

They say it fades if you let it
Love was made to forget it 
I carved your name across my eyelids 
You pray for rain, I pray for blindness

If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is falling from me. 
If you still want me, please forgive me 
Because the spark is not within me. 

I snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
The only thing that you keep changin' is your name
My love keeps growin' still the same 
Just like a cancer
And you won't give me a straight answer.

If you still want me, please forgive me 
The crown of love is falling from me. 
If you still want me, please forgive me 
Because your hands are not upon me. 

I shrugged them off before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
The pains of love
And they keep growin', 
In my heart there's flowers growin'
On the grave of our old love
Since you gave me a straight answer.

If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is not upon me.
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Because the spark is not within me.
It's not within me.
It's not within me.
You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word that I can say!
You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word,
The only word that I can say!
Only word that I can say!

// Wake Up //

Somethin' filled up
my heart with nothin'.
Someone told me not to cry.

But now that I'm older,
my heart's colder,
and I can see that it's a lie.

Children, wake up.
Hold your mistake up
before they turn the summer into dust.

If the children don't grow up,
our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up.
We're just a million little gods causin' rain storms,
turnin' every good thing to rust.

I guess we'll just have to adjust.

With my lightnin' bolts a glowin',
I can see where I am goin' to be
when the reaper he reaches and touches my hand.

With my lightnin' bolts a glowin',
I can see where I am goin'.
With my lightnin' bolts a glowin',
I can see where I am go -- goin'!

You better look out below!

// Haïti //

Haïti, mon pays,
Wounded mother I'll never see
Ma famille set me free.
Throw my ashes into the sea.

Mes cousins jamais nés
Hantent les nuits de Duvalier.
Rien n'arrête nos esprits.
Guns can't kill what soldiers can't see.

In the forest we are hiding,
Unmarked graves where flowers grow.
Hear the soldiers angry yelling,
In the river we will go.

Tous les morts-nés forment une armée
Soon we will reclaim the earth.
All the tears and all the bodies
Bring about our second birth

Haïti, never free,
N'aie pas peur de sonner l'alarme.
Tes enfants sont partis,
In those days their blood was still warm.

// Rebellion (Lies) //

Sleeping is giving in
No matter what the time is
Sleeping is giving in
So lift those heavy eyelids

People say that you'll die
Faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son and scare your daughter

People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya
Come on baby in our dreams, we can live our misbehaviour

Every time you close your eyes (Lies, lies) [x4]
Every time you close your eyes [x4]

People try and hide the night
Underneath the covers
People try and hide the light
Underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers, underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers, underneath the covers
Hidin' from your brothers, underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers underneath the covers

People say that you'll die 
Faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son and scare your daughter
Scare your son and scare your daughter
Scare your son and scare your daughter

Now here's the sun, it's alright! (Lies, lies)
Now here's the moon, it's alright! (Lies, lies)
Now here's the sun, it's alright! (Lies, lies)
Now here's the moon, it's alright! (Lies, lies)

Every time you close your eyes (Lies, lies) [x4]

Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes

// In The Backseat //

I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside
And I can fall asleep

My family tree's
Losing all its leaves
Crashing towards the driver's seat
The lightning bolt made enough heat 
To melt the street beneath your feet

Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning

I like the peace
In the back-seat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside

Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning

// My Buddy //

The night is long since you went away
I dream about you all through the day
My buddy, my buddy, no buddy quite so true.
(Hey that's a wrong note,
And that's a wrong note,
And tune up that G string,
And that's better, that's better, that's better)
Miss your voice, the touch of your hand
I long to know that you understand
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you

// Brazil //

Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon 
And softly whispered, "Someday soon"
We kissed and clung together

Then - tomorrow was another day
The morning found us miles away
With still a million things to say
And now, the twilight moves the skies above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I'm certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil

Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly whispered, "Someday soon"
We kissed and clung together

Then - tomorrow was another day
The morning found us miles away
With still a million things to say
And now when twilight moves the skies above
Recalling thrills of our love 
There's one thing I'm certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil
