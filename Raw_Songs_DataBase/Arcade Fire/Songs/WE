I wanna get wild
I wanna get free
Would you want to get off this ride with me?

I wanna get down
Get down on one knee
Would you wanna get off this ride with me?

I wanna give in
I wanna give out
Wanna give away everything in this house

I wanna get going
Before the fires burn out
You can give away everything in this house

I wanna give up
I wanna give down
Wanna give away everything in my hometown

Already know I
I wanna know we
Would you want to get off this ride with me?

When everything ends
Can we do it again?
When everything ends
Wanna do it again?
When everything ends
Can we do it again?
When everything ends
Can we do it again?
