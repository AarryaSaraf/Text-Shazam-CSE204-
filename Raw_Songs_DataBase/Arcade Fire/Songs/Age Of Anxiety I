It's the age of doubt
And I doubt we'll figure it out
Is it you or is it me?
Age of anxiety
(Are you talking to me?)

Fight the fever with TV
In the age where nobody sleeps
And the pills do nothing for me
In the age of anxiety

When I look at you
I see what you want me to, see what you want me to
When you look at me
See what I want you to see
What I want you to see

In the age of
Living in the age of
Living in the age of
In the age of
Living in the age of
Living in the age of

It's a maze of mirrors
It's a hologram of a ghost
And you can't quite touch it
Which is how it hurts us the most

So we keep it all inside
And hide it deep in a drawer
Say your prayers tonight
Someone finds it after the war

And when I look at you
I see what you want me to, see what you want me to
When you look at me
See what I want you to see
What I want you to see is me

In the age of
Living in the age of
Living in the age of
In the age of
Living in the age of
Living in the age of
Anxiety

Gotta get this spirit out of me
This anxiety that's inside of me
Gotta get the spirit out of me
This anxiety that's inside of me

Gotta get this spirit out of me
This anxiety that's inside of me, baby
Gotta get this spirit out of me
This anxiety that's inside of me, baby

'Cause I can't stop crying and I really think I mean it but
The tears mean nothing to me
Another lost alien arriving on my spaceship in the age of anxiety
We can't stop crying and we really think we mean it
But the tears just fall on the sheets
Another lost soul just trying to feel something
Trying to feel something
Trying to feel something in the age of

Are you talking to me
Or about me?
Am I talking to you
Or about you?

It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you (It's not about you)
It's all about you (It's not about you)
It's all about you (It's not about you)
It's all about you (It's not about you)
