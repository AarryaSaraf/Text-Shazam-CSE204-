Fourth place anthem playing tonight
On a broken radio
Thought WE reached the mountaintop, but now
WE just feel so low
The sky is breaking open
WE keep hoping in the distance
WE'll see a glow
Lightning light our way
Till the black sky turns back to indigo

WE can make it if you don't quit on me
I won't quit on you, don't quit on me
WE can make it, baby, please don't quit on me
I won't quit on you, don't quit on me
I'll never quit on you

WE were born in paradise beneath a poisoned sky
Under a bad sign, the micro-age of gemini
And WE are still unlearning
Tires are burning in the middle of Rodeo Drive
You know that WE've been beat down and broken
But now WE can testify

WE can make it if you don't quit on me
I won't quit on you, don't quit on me
WE can make it, baby, please don't quit on me
I won't quit on you, don't quit on me
I'll never quit on you

It's not up to YOU some you win, some you lose
(When the lightning comes)
YOU don't get to choose, some you win, some you lose
(When the lightning comes)
