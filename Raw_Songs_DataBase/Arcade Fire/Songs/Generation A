This is Generation A and we're not gonna wait!

They say wait a little longer
And the times are gonna change
They say wait until tomorrow
Yesterday is always strange
They say wait until you're older
And you will understand
They say the generation's coming
But I don't think they understand
That I am not a patient man

I can't wait
I can't wait
Too little, too late
Too little, too late

(Wait)
They say wait until you're ready (Wait)
Wait until your number's called (Wait)
They say "Wait, all we need is love"
But darling, California's burning
New Orleans is waiting for the flood

I can't wait
I can't wait
Too little, too late
(They think they can take us)
Too little, too late
I can't wait
I can't wait
Too little, too late
It's too little, too late

This ain't the summer of love
This is the summer of rock
Racist running, cities burning
Children show you what they're learning
Whole world finally fade away
Walk like generation A

I can't wait
I can't wait
Too little, too late
Too little, too late
They think they can take us
I can't wait
I can't wait
Too little, too late
It's too little, too late
