Water

Scales falling from my eyes, I follow the bronco
If they ever ask you, tell them I'm upset, no

From the Maserati I only kept the headlights
From the promise to land, I only figured the fights
From this declaration I only tasted the tears
From the congregation, flames have been bursting for years

Ten, twenty years from now
Nobody will know how
Is it precisely why
You let the mire flow by?

Who is the stranger
Behind the barreaux
Water, forest animals?
Who is the stranger
Behind the barreaux
Water, forest animals?

It took courage to loosen their solid embrace
Force fields are flowing strongly with every display (Water)

From the Maserati I only kept the headlights
From the promise to land, I only figured the fights
From this declaration I only tasted the tears
From the congregation, flames have been bursting for years

Ten, twenty years from now
Nobody will know how
Is it precisely why
You let the mire flow by?

Who is the stranger
Behind the barreaux
Water, forest animals?
Who is the stranger
Behind the barreaux
Water, forest animals?
Who is the stranger
Behind the barreaux
Water, forest animals?
Who is the stranger
Behind the barreaux
Water, forest animals?
