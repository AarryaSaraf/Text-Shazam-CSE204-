Oh, Jamil, he said
What are you waiting for?
Oh, Jamil, he waited by the door
Oh, Jamil, he offered to cook for me
Oh, Jamil, he said I was an angel

Oh, cook for me
Oh, light up for me
Oh, tender boy I am
Oh, solid, my birdman

Wait 'til I feel ready
To give it all right now to you
Oh, Jamil, he said
He was right
I needed it, and I still do

Oh, cook for me
Oh, light up for me
Oh, tender boy I am
Oh, solid, my birdman

Good birdman
Birdman
Good flavor man
Good, magic birdman
Good
Magic birdman, good birdman
Good
