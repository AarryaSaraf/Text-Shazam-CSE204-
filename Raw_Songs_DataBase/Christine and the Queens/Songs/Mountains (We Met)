What are you saying
Do you think there's only one thing to do
To write a song about you now
Could make sense for other people too
Why are you leaving
If I can't touch your body too
I'll write a song about you now
Pretend that you're the one with me

Mountains, mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains, mountains, mountains
Since we met, we met, we met
We met, we met, we met, we met

I can speak in silence
If you can't hear then grey and blue
I'll write a song about you now, let me destroy this will of mine
What are you saying
Do you think now it's just my fate
To write a song about you, late, for other faces than just yours

Mountains, mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains, mountains, mountains
Since we met, we met, we met
We met, we met, we met, we met

Mountains, mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains, mountains, mountains
Since we met, we met, we met
We met, we met, we met, we met

Mountains, mountains, we met
Hm, we met, we met, oh
Mountains
