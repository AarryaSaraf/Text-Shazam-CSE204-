Sun don't shine
The moon don't move
The tides to wash me clean

Why so unforgiving
And why so cold
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs


Cold wind blows
And the gods look down
In anger of this poor child

Cold wind blows
And the gods look down
In anger of this poor child


Why so unforgiving
And why so cold
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs
