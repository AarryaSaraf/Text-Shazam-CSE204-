Autumn creeps away now, vanquishing mob rules
Torches in their eyes, prowling to unravel hidden jewels
Drown me in the lake where stones divide the mist
Inheritance of others courting the dismissed

Take me too away from here
Far away
Please don't leave me be

The forests waning beauty 'neath a drafted epitaph
It's our human duty as plastic in the rough
To tether on the heartstrings of a mythic century
Paving for destruction
Waving mock decrees

Watch yourself every day
You are dying
But please don't leave me be

Do it for yourself
Tomorrow is the past
Do it for yourself
Not even actual facts can last

Please don't leave me be

Is it true that the mirror shows the enemy?
