Follow the embers
into cities of dreams
What you'll be seeing
Is not all what it seems

Dawn of the liar
Future's a pyre

Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry
Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep
I wish this beating would so reveal the love I keep

Lock down your senses
Await the grating beyond
And in the morning
This darkness will trail along

Born as a failure
And died as a stranger

And your country's bleeding while you're forced to mourn

Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry
Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep
I wish this beating would so reveal the love I keep

Bring me back again
