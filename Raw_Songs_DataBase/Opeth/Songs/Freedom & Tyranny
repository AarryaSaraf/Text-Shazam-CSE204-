Let us refuse to wait 'til morning
Return the ghost from whence it came
A version of the forgery slipped through
Tampered with the facts and changed its name

Yet every night has its consoling agents
Close your eyes and see

The emperor will ride without direction
And give us submission as a price
Salvation is hidden in the fire
Fall to your knees, devour the lies

Yet every night has its consoling agents
Close your eyes and see

Sovereign smoke is overcast
Free will wasn't meant to last

Hidden in a dream
Suffrage reigns
The changing, unshackled yearning
Once again, same refrain
Echo through the kingdom
Songs of love and death
Wounds of love and death
