Album: Sorceress

// Persephone //

A beloved name inside my heart
A fleeting glance became the start
A missing word I am still awaiting
A wretched deception I am creating

// Sorceress //

I am a sinner and I worship evil
Blood is thinner but you will never know
Can you confess that you thrive in chaos?
You're a sorceress and your eye is on the lost

But you're dying
It's in your eyes

You're a charlatan
You get everything you wish
You're a harlot
Carry poison in your kiss

Beg forgiveness
With a dagger in your hand
Sow your death seed
And reap the dying lands

But you're crying
It's only vice

Empty vessel
Drained of hope
And none the lesser at the end of
A rope
Have you ever hated like I?
Know I still awaited the absence of lies

Watch your eager tongue
Attack me from behind

Riddle whispers
Bleak futile control
Like a twin sister
Adapting to a role

You're a murderer
Bloodlust increase
You're a harvester
Come close to spread disease

And you're hiding
I hear you cry

// The Wilde Flowers //

Sun hangs high, I turn away
Failure underground
Heart is sick and fever is high
Waiting for a sound

Like a trail of insects to me
I watch them from afar
Feeding, breeding, scheming
Tell me I am wrong

Hiding from discovery
Staring down into the ground
Had they seen the posion in me
A tide of spite wound be found

Moving faster lingering gaze
Feasting on my sanity
A grain of sand against endless waves
A wish for the slaughter of conformity

Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre

Inside me sleeps a violence waiting to be freed

Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre

Blinding light and the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Should I speak and they'll call me a liar
I'll retreat to my funeral pyre

My sanctuary, a thousand centuries
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting

// Will O The Wisp //

When you're tired of waiting and time is not on your side
When you're tired of hating me, you no longer want to hide

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

When there's trouble admitting that you have been wrong all along
When the words you have written down reads "everything is gone"

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

When you smother your friendships and take much more than you need
When you can't keep a secret to yourself and points to the source of the deed

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And you can never find the satisfaction
When you can't outgrow your false distractions

You know your soul is weighed on the silver scale of deceit and lies

// Chrysalis //

And on the furthest day when you lay down
Discard your disarray and your rusted crown
And face the wretched image of you and I
No trust in what you say, you are a dead poison seed
Stronger when you are away, you have nothing that I need
The rhyme has settled in the ghost of a sigh
Nothing now remains, now you will leave me be

Sunrise into the moonlight
A broken body lies in wait
Your prize won you the stark night
And you made peace with your fate
Blind eyes sensitive only to white light
Reacting just a bit too late

Preying on insecurity, a design of your schemes
A true believer of purity must tend to what it means
Or allow its gospel to turn into a lie
You forsake everything you feel in favor of despair
Immune and blind to everything that is real in your secret lair
And cast away the captive heart that was thine

And you will go and leave me be

Winter in your soul, building a wasteland
And you tread a thin ice 'neath your feet
Sneering, and everyone you would shun
Collecting flowers to your wreath
Lifeline, a river cuts deep in your cold hand
It is changing when you try to breathe

Leave it all behind you, there is comfort in giving up
A seed in a barren soil might curl up into a coil
Flourish into something new
Give back what you thought was "you"
And give way to all that is new

Leave it all behind you...

// Sorceress 2 //

Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line

And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away

Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line

And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away

Ice melting into the sea
Your river flowing back to me

And when you take your final breath
In many years from now, no less
I hope you feel a peace at heart
Don't be afraid to kiss the dark

And don't ever wonder if I stayed
My love for you can not die away

// The Seventh Sojourn //

Hold me in your arms
Never do me harm
Never do me harm
Hold me in your arms

A raging sea in your eyes
Gives away your disguise
Grants me the peace to leave
And finally leave you be

// Strange Brew //

An afternoon walk through the park
I keep to the shadows until it's dark

I am not educated nor free of sin
I carry thoughts of giving in

There is a void surrounding me
No sound, and in the black I can not see
There is a chasm between you and me
You have no face, no body, no words to speak

There is a wickedness in me
I can't seem to make it go away
I am a spiritual leper but I can see
A flock of believers gone astray

There's eternal night in my gaze
I'm cast out and I am not like you
Find my way on through the haze
I'm liquefied in a strange brew

An early morn walk through the park
I look to the sun when it is cold and stark

I blend with the crows of robot minds
Never a leader, I am always behind

A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears
A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears
A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears

A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears

// A Fleeting Glance //

Up until recently I have been alone
Leading a tranquil life but never at home
Something had changed and I turned to the wind
That blew through me and told me, "How long? How long?"

Silenced the voice of my heart now for years
I was perplexed by a fleeting blank stare
Biding my time until courage had build up inside me
Then came clean, "Or am I wrong"

I spend all my days contemplating my will
For the weak shall inherit the earth when it's still
A government bid for my life
I was sold as a cog in a machine, "I walk the line"

A fleeting glance again tells me everything
Took a chance in vain, drown to a futile idea
A pursuit of happiness as the storm rolls in
An idol of helplessness, paved the way and then gave in

I met with my mother and I asked her why
For ten years so more she would never reply
Suddenly she said we are all born to die
Gave me purpose, freed me, "How simple it can be"

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another "me" waiting behind

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another "me" waiting behind

// Era //

There's a sign in the rain
Every now and again
It is a symbol of hope
In the midst of a catastrophic episode

In the hour of death
There's a spiritual wealth
When we dance through the rain
And form the signs once again

If even for a second

I hear a voice on the air
It has a warning to share
"Don't believe what you see"
"You can't perceive what you feel"

But if I do what I'm told
And shun the spirit I hold
I'm no longer a human
And I will not shift with the sands

The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

There are moments of doubt when I don't know what to do
And giving in is the only way out
When there's too much shouting about how I should choose

Incapacitated, I'm left behind
In a sea of hatred I go blind
A storm is coming, I hide away
In the years of need reason leads astray

The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you
He lives in you
He lives in you

// Persephone (Slight Return) //

The years went by with disquieting grace
A past obsession sunk without a trace
I moved into winter and found my home
As my boiling blood had turned to chrome

// The Ward //

I am going away, I am going down
I am going away, I am going down

Sifting through a memory before it fades away
Adolescent secrecy, a million words astray

I can't remember happiness, I thrive within the dark
The security of a loneliness is a veil that keeps my calm

By the way, I'm doing fine
I have a place to stay, just behind the sunshine
And by the way, I don't need sympathy
I have a place to lay, I have more than you can see

I walk the streets alone at night, it helps to ease my mind
I lay me down come the morning light and leave all woes behind

// Spring MCMLXXIV //

On a wind that's sailing through the morning
I have cut the harness off of my heart
On a tide that's rising with the dawning
I find I belong inside the dark

And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page

Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home

Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home

There's a dream that tells me I'm haunted
It comes to visit every fortnight or so
I wake up having lost all I have ever wanted
And a bleak apparition wants what I hold

And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page

Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home

Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home

Should it disappear, should it go away?
Would it mend the wounds I bare, the wound of love?
Could it reappear like a familiar tale?
Like a broken friendship that snuffs the moonlight above
