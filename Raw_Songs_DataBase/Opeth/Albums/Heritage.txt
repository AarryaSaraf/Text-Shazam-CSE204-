Album: Heritage

// The Devil's Orchard //

This trail is obsidian, the grip of Winter uncoiled
A lover would follow me
Cast down and sworn to the dark

Take the road where devils speak
"God is dead"

The wealth of darkness
Inside you, tell you "now"
Your senses corrupted
Controlling a poisonous will

Take the road where devils speak
"God is dead"

In the corner of my eye
You are tearing flesh from bone

Led the blind in search to find
A pathway to the sun
Saw the signs intertwine
And forgave me all my sins

No stigmas revealing our vices
And there are no stigmas revealing our vices

God is dead

// I Feel The Dark //

I feel the dark when I see you
I feel the dark when I see you

Loosen the harness of trust
Survey an impulse of lust
The thespian is far away
Uprooted yet forced to stay

Sing a lie, ghost of the night
Give yourself to me
The road is long and winding still
And these bonds will start to fray
But another day

A flaking wish inside

Veiled comes the daylight through the glass
In the never-ending rain
This is no friend of mine
Stalking the comfort within

A flaking wish inside
The mother of lies

And you're going out to war
When the beast is coming home
And the sun is seen no more
For the devil's love you bore

I feel the dark when I see you

// Slither //

Summer's gone and love has withered
I believe in nothing yet nothing is what it seems
All is gone and promises slithered
You gave me nothing yet nothing is what it seems

Summer is gone

Your eyes gave away all your lies in the end
The dawning of a seething design
Kept a secret from the light
And felt the weight on my shoulders increase

A bleeding heart led by desperation
Like a bird on a wire
A broken promise of dedication
Never ever again

// Nepenthe //

Hope would fail me in the falling snow
And slake a wish inside

Friends would leave me in my darkest hour
Yet trust me with their lives

She would haunt my dreams and feed my demons
They tell me to go

// HÃ¤xprocess //

A lifeline in a drop of blood
A dying wish shun a God
Sought a dream inside the light
Finally relieved from plight

O this night is decieveing
One eternal Winter
Earth below and reeling
Moon is riding high

Father and a liar
One forgotten season
Secrets in the mire
Moor is riding high

Aligning

A name inside a memory
Waiting for you
When words can't win her
There is nothing to do

Save your children
Drenched in poverty
Tracks in the snow
Leading them to woe

// Famine //

I can't see your face
And I can't breathe your air
So I wonder why I get cold inside
When I hear your name

When we meet eye to eye
I will ask how and why
And when guilt has its way
One lesser reason to stay
And I will see her cry

Into the fire of our youth comes the devil again
And you feel your way, feel your way

Saw you standing nigh
In the corner
Told me that you had died
And I would die when my heart was empty
Become a ghost in perpetual void
And neglect all reasons why

// The Lines In My Hand //

We are dying in the wake of gods and decrees remain arcane
And everything around us is a consequence of pain

We are dying in the wake of gods and decrees remain arcane
And everything around us is a consequence of pain

We are dying in the wake of gods and decrees remain arcane
And everything around us is a consequence of pain

The writings on the wall depict a truth that no one sees
A government of puppets blinded by another creed

Burning voice of insanity
Nothing is the same
Barren lands for the idle man
Find all the lines in your hand

Blinding storms are surrounding us
Take control
In our caps, poisoned wine
Find all the lines in your hand

// Folklore //

Hey you, will you be true
When you can see through what I do
Feel the pain in your brain, insane
Will I see my name in your scars

And you will see what you mean to me

Lust between the lines
Do you feel the need
When the night comes down
And when the night comes down
A father is waiting

And you will see what you mean to me

Lost control and called your name
Left a home in the pouring rain
In a sea of guilt and shame
Will we sustain

// Pyre //

Follow the embers
into cities of dreams
What you'll be seeing
Is not all what it seems

Dawn of the liar
Future's a pyre

Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry
Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep
I wish this beating would so reveal the love I keep

Lock down your senses
Await the grating beyond
And in the morning
This darkness will trail along

Born as a failure
And died as a stranger

And your country's bleeding while you're forced to mourn

Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry
Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep
I wish this beating would so reveal the love I keep

Bring me back again

// Face In The Snow //

No more wishes for the past,
No lingering of sages and seers.
Desperations and fevers last,
The undertows are stronger here.

And here I lie, another morning arrives,
Too far away from coming home.

I see a face in the snow.
Inside my head a voice calls for me.
I see your face in the snow
And outside the sun's too far away to feel.

And here I lie, another morning arrives,
Too far away from coming home.

And here I lie, another morning arrives,
Too far away from coming home.

And could we live within the wake of aging lies
When we're too far away?
