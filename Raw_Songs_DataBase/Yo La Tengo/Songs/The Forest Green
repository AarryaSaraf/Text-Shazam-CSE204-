Says he's tired of people in black
The weight of the world on  backs
Life can hurt you, sit in the shade
 lemonade

This is through the way

Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't wait

She wakes up angry, says "I'll never learn"
Standing over her coffee and roasts til it burns
Can't eat the food here, it's made of chlorine
I want the path to the green, not the path to the gray

This is through the way

Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait
