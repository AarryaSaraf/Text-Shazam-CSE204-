Big sky looked down at all the people looking up at the big sky
Everyone was pushing one another around
Big sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry
Big sky's too big to let it get him down

Big sky's too big to cry
Big sky's too high to see
People like you and me

One day we'll be free
We won't care, just you wait and see
'Til that day can be
Don't let it get you down

And when I think
That the world's too much for me
I think of the big sky
And nothing matters much to me

Big sky looked down on all the people who think they have problems
They get depressed, they hold their head in their hands and they cry
People lift up their heads and look up to the big sky
Big sky's too big to sympathize

Big sky's too occupied
Though he would like to try
Then he'd feel glad inside
Big sky's too big to cry

One day we'll be free
We won't care, just you wait and see
'Til that day can be
Don't let it get you down

And when I think
That the world's too much for me
I think of the big sky
And nothing matters much to me
