Do you need someone to hide behind?
Well, I don't mind, well, I don't mind
Do you need to be alone to unwind?
Well, that's alright, that's alright

Sure I know it's hard
You know that it's that way for everyone, for everyone
Some things go wrong
Sink so low you even blame the sun

You blame it as the cause
Of the shadows on the wall
They're not as bad as they appear
Could it be that it's the season of the shark?

Do you need someone to help you through?
Well, I don't know, I don't know
Someone to take questions for you
I don't know, I don't know

I want to be
The one to make you feel okay right now, someway, somehow
When I fall short
I sink so low I even blame the clouds

For blocking out the sun
And the shadows on the wall
That's why you feel alone
Could it be that it's the season of the shark?

Please don't be afraid
No matter how much out there scares you so, scares you so
Just look around
If it's not me then someone else you know

You're not alone at all
Ignore the shadows on the wall
They don't mean a thing
Could it be that it's the season, I believe that it's the season of the shark

Could it be that it's the season of the shark?
