What am I wearing?

It passes me by
Why, oh why?

Why am I lonely?
I've just sat by
For so many years
Why, oh why?

I make the rounds to talk with you
A chance to causes number one
I wonder where my rabbit hole
I'm through changing
I'll be just who I want

My love

I came here to the city
When it wasn't hard to live
Manufacturer on a side street
Til I had to sell it out and move away
Why, oh why?

Many cold nights go by
I sit home wondering why
Did I get tired of hating?
I'm through caring
I'll wear bells if I wanna

Playing around
Playing around
Playing around
