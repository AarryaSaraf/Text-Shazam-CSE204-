He scribbled down a little note
To send news home from camp
And stuffed it in an envelope
And hunted for a stamp
His roommate had a scrapbook-full
Just sitting on a shelf
He didn't think his pal would mind
So he just helped himself

He had made mistakes before
In fact, he made more than his share
But this one was a big one
Because the stamp he took was rare
His roommate didn't mind it though
In fact, it made him laugh
For the stamp was worth half a grand
Insured for a grand and a half
