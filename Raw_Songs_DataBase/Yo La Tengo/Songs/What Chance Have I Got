Turn back, look at me
Believe in what you see
You may stumble away
I cannot
Fire at will
What chance have I got

Come back, can it be
How can you disagree
If your doubt's so strong
Though mine is not
Shoot to kill
What chance have I got

If that's not enough
And I know it's not
Stand your ground
What chance have I got

Hands outstretched
What chance have I got
