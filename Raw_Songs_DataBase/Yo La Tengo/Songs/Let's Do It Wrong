I've been outsmarted
Everybody's pawn
I'm the one that's easiest to string along
But now I know better
It's time for this dog to have its day
No advice, sweet and nice
Let's do it wrong

I've been a fool
Since I was born
I'd have to say more idiot than savant
But now I know better
This cat will tree its prey
I repeat, nice and sweet
Let's do it wrong

In a sense, a swan song
My critique, so to speak
Let's do it wrong
