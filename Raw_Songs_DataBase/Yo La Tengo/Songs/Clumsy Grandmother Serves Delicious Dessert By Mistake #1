She was too close to candles burning on her birthday cake
She meant to blow them out but blew them over by mistake
They flew across the table, bounced and scattered everywhere
One landed in my cup of juice, one landed on my chair
One landed in my ice cream bowl and yet it wasn't wasted
It made a Baked Alaska better than I'd ever tasted
