You are so distant, you're so all alone
You possess a reputation for being cold
Oh but lately when I look at you I see a trace of a smile
Oh know that I see a spark of interest for me in your eyes
And I'm not really worried cause

I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip
I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip

You always keep your feelings to yourself
You never share a moment with no one else
Oh but now it's like electricity every time our eyes meet
Your resistance is weakening and pretty soon you will be
My sweet baby cause

I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip
I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip

Your disguise is transparent and baby I can see right through you
Ooh I know that you care for me and lover I care for you
So baby stop pretending cause

I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip
I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip
Can almost feel it drip
