See you walking sometimes, circumstances start to happen after awhile 
and it's starting to seem like there's nothing left 
like there's nothing left at all 
Well it drags me down, it's pulling me down 
lower, lower 
I feel it pullin, here it comes 
So come on take the time, 
come on, to make up your mind, 
come on, Let's give it all away 
Starts to wear me down 
And I can't get it to stop 
When's it gonna stop 
Look on your face, just the look on your face 
Makes me feel all a little down, down inside 
Come on, take the time, come on, make up your mind, come on 
Let's give it all away 
Come on, take the time, come on, make up your mind, come on 
Let's give it all away
