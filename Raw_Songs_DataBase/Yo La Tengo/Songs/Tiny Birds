I will go if you say you'll go, do you want to go?
I won't talk at all, but I'll go for a ride
I will go if you just let go, do you want to go?
Is it all because of the time I took your advice?

I will go if you still want to go, do you want to go?
And I will show what you want me to show, do you want to know?
Until there's nothing left in the world to show you

On we go, but where I don't know, do you want to go?
You don't talk at all but it's alright
Feeling bold but your nose is cold like it's made of snow
Is it all because of the time you took my advice?

If you put your hand in my palm, I won't let it go
Until there's nothing left in the world to make me

Summer stinks and summer stays too long
Autumn comes and all of a sudden it's gone
Tiny birds sit patiently
Side by side on a wire

Darker days and leaves in shades so true
Wind unfolds on nights so black they're blue
Tiny birds fly by silently
Side by side in the sky

Don't be sad when it's time to say goodnight
I'll be there to make sure that you sleep tight
I'm your friend when you need a friend
Until there's nothing left in the world to make you cry
