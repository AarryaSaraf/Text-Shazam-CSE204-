He's hard at work in a secret lab
Making soap into chewing gum
He's trying hard to improve the taste
And he's hoping a breakthrough will come
For years now, he's worked on his formula
And some day, it will come

He's hard at work in a secret lab
Making soap into chewing gum
He's trying hard to improve the taste
And he's hoping a breakthrough will come
For years now, he's worked on his formula
But all that he has for his troubles
Is something tastes exactly like soap
But works pretty good for blowing bubbles

Someday it will come
His big breakthrough
