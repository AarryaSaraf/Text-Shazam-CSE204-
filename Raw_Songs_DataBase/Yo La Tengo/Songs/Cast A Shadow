The sandman is bringing me a special gift
A sleepy dream memory of our first kiss

Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction

The sandman comes tonight, I have a request
A snapshot dreamy keepsake of your embrace

Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction

Cast your shadow over here, we'll make shadow plays
We'll dig shallow graves in my shady shadow cave
Your shadow grows longer in my twilight sleep
I wallow in remember your lock me keep

Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction

Bring back shadows of your affection
Cast your shadow in my direction
Bring back shadows of your protection
Cast your shadow in my direction
