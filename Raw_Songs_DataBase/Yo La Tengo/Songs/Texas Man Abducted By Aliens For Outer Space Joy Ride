They cruised around the universe
They were looking for girls, I guess
All I could think of was:
How did I ever get myself into this mess?

I didn't have much money
They didn't have much class
I didn't even want to go
And they made me pay for gas

They swerved around the planets
At a thousand times a minute
Singings songs, I sang along
But my heart wasn't in it

They dropped me off at home
And in a wink they were gone
They didn't even apologize
For the skid marks on my lawn

They cruised around the universe
They were looking for girls, I guess
All I could think of was:
How did I ever get myself into this mess?

I didn't have much money
They didn't have much class
I didn't even want to go
And they made me pay for gas

They said that some day they might be back
I wish they would let me be
In fact, if I don't ever see them
It'll be just fine with me
