Stars will fall from the sky
And daylight will realise
Your pain would subside
If not for the weakest part
Of your heart

Bells ring out endlessly
Seem hard to ignore
But you, like a fool,
Just don't see
It preys on the weakest part
Of your heart

Some sunny day
The wind will come along
And scatter the dusty sleep
And you'll open your eyes

Stars could fall right out of the sky
If not for the weakest part
Bells will ring til the end of time
If not for the weakest part
Someday soon it'll be alright
