We are out of words
We're out of time
Believe the worst

While we, we gasp the air
Grasp at straws
No longer there

Eyes shut, blinded
Darkness without dawn
We, we had our run, we're gone

We ignore the crap
Don't answer questions
We didn't ask

Most days, we circumvent
Tune out the world
Except our friends

Eyes shut, blinded
Road remains clear
Always on the run, we're here
