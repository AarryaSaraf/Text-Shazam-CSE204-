Spun out in the world
Just in sync to break out of my mind
Out of this in the world
Nothing seems to take me out of my mind

Night time in
But with wind
Cold winds always push me back inside
I'll hide

When the sun comes in
Will you smile at me
And call my name
When it's dark
Will I come apart?

This day where we've been alone
I can't seem to get out of my mind
We'll win this race alone
Sometimes it really drives me out of my mind

Night time in
But with wind
Cold winds always push me back inside
I'll hide

When the sun comes in
Will you smile at me
And call my name
When it's dark
Will I come apart?

And when I see you
See you far up higher than me
I can hear it turn and look the other way

When the sun comes in
Will you smile at me
And call my name
But the rain she comes
Let the clouds come in
And the clouds will break
When the stars are overhead
Will the clouds come in
And carry me away?
When it's dark and it rains
Will I come apart?
