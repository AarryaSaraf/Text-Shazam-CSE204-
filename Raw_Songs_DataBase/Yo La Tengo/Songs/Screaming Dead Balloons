I sit on my lawn
Watching cars go by
I'd stay inside
Under 

I'm not lying no more
Not afraid or alone anymore
Not afraid of the daybreak
I feel like  or being alone
Being alone now

When it's all been decided for you
When I'm waiting for eternal fight
And it's all just a matter of facts
It's a long goodbye

I sit in my room
With the curtain pulled tight
Sleep away the afternoon
Stay awake all night

I'm not laughing no more
Not afraid or alone anymore
Not afraid of the daybreak
 being alone
All alone now

When it's all been decided for you
When I'm waiting for eternal fight
And it's all just a matter of facts
It's a long goodbye
