Laid in my room to reflect my mood
Facing my feelings with a life without you
Orange and yellow

Doesn't matter what's the use
Whenever I see him, there are shades of blue

Staring at walls when I'm feeling down
Staying indoors 'cause your not around
Indigo violet
Doesn't matter, what's the use?
Whenever I see him, there are shades of blue

Shades of blue

Choosing a color for my particular point of view
Kidding myself
There are shades of blue

Whenever I see him
Oh shades of blue
