I'd gone to the hospital
For simple surgery,
When the slippery-fingered doctor
Dropped his watch inside of me.
He tried to get it out.
He tried and tried and tried.
He couldn't get it!
So he sewed it up inside.
Now the ticking drives me crazy.
I put cotton in my ear.
The battery in that watch
Is guaranteed for years.
The doctor has a tip for me
To help relieve the shock.
He said, "Be glad it's a watch,
And not a cuckoo clock."
