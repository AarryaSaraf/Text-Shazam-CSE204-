Waited just a little bit too long 
Stopped mattering why 
When does a thing alright turn wrong 
And X turns to Y 
If there is a way she'll admit she's wrong 
She wonders why he went away. 
He never said that much at all. 
He's waited real hard for things to change 
to something she won't criticize 
He's real mad and thinks about nothing 
nothing at all, then the feeling dies 
If there is a way she'll admit she's wrong 
She wonders why he went away. 
He never said that much. 
If there is a way she'll admit she's wrong 
She wonders why he went away. 
He never said that much. 
If there is a way she'll admit she's wrong 
If there is a way she'll admit she's wrong
