Saw you at a party, you asked me to dance
Said the music was great for dancing
I don't really dance much, but this time I did
And I was glad that I did this time

And the song said "Let's be happy," I was happy
It never made me happy before
And the song said "Don't be lonely," it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more

Where I belong
Where I belong

I wasn't dressed right, I rarely am
You told me that you didn't care
I laughed as you wobbled in your platform shoes
You laughed when I called Andrea true Anita Ward

And the song said "Let's be happy," I was happy
It never made me happy before
And the song said "Don't be lonely," it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more

Where I belong
Where I belong

And the song said "Let's be happy," I was happy
It never made me happy before
It asked "Do you remember?" and I remember
Remember like it wasn't long ago

And the song said "Don't be lonely," it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more
Where I belong
Where I belong
