The sword-swallowing circus strongman
And his snake-charming tattooed wife
Decided that they would become regular parents
And just lead a regular life

They bought a big house in the country
With a hammock, a hill and a hedge
There's a swing on the porch, a pond in the yard
And a white picket fence around the edge

And they lead a regular life

The sword-swallowing circus strongman
And his snake-charming tattooed wife
Decided that they would become regular parents
And just lead a regular life

Now they're just a regular family now
Having regular family fun
With their fire-eating, fan-dancing daughter
And their dog-faced contortionist son

They lead a regular life

Each weekend now, they wash the car
And barbecue and jog
They bought a great big TV set
And a little Scottie dog
