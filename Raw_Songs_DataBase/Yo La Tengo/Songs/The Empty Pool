Too unpressed for strategy so dignity must be spared
Watch the leaves in the empty pool as the widow drew her shade

Season was here
No drums to calm their fear
Let's drink the leper's beer

The leper's playing his salsa game and tempest swept dark land
The lover's turns and parasites over the frying pan

Coffee's brewed
And the men playing cards
And the mystery plane
And the forest winds
Their searching out overy the sea
