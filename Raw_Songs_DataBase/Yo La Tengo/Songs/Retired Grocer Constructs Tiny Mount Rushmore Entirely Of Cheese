He'd been retired for a week or so
When his interest in art was renewed
He found he had extra time on his hands
And he kind of missed working with food
So he made a tiny Mount Rushmore
Constructed completely of cheese
Then he added a cute little forest scene
Made out of noodles and peas
Next came a little log cabin
He built using sausage-link logs
But sadly the whole thing was swallowed
By a couple of art-loving dogs
