Let's be still, be still for awhile
There's no place I want to be
Lose our way and sit side by side
Passing time so carelessly, so carelessly

Along the shore, a quiet night
Take off our shoes and watch the sky
Against the moon the clouds go by
I hold your hand, you start to cry

Lost in our dreams of summer love
The only place I want to be
Find a spot and hope no one tells
Time goes by unendingly, unendingly
