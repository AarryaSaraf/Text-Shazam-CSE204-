I am just some guy barely polite
The civil tongue and I barely collide
It builds inside until I just let it fly

I am just some guy with too much pride
And all that that implies
I won't tonight
Way too snide
It's not hard to verify

But if it's not too late
If I could protect you
Whenever you expect me to for you
When everything's hurting
Things are uncertain
Maybe I could be that guy

But if it's not too late
If I could protect you, whenever you expect me to for you
Whenever there's hurting things are uncertain
Maybe I could be that guy, I'd like to try
