We stared at the sun, too long
until the shapes before our eyes
turned into the sun, in our eyes
We lied to ourselves for awhile
in our usual style
I wish we could ride 
To ourselves again

We made up our minds 
to lose and never once looked back
We only looked back
just once
We opened our hearts, it's true
But not to any of you
Sold out of the myth
too soon

And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard

We stared at the road ahead
Closed our eyes and then
sped up to the turn, around the bend
With nothing to lose, we lost
Suffered every cost
It still causes pain to calm

And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard

And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard
And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
And we ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard

Refused to let go
of the air
There was something there
Sparks foam with gold
A million strong
and match forever lights in a row
I'm still flushed from the glow
I'm down on the road
back home
We stared at the sun, too long
until the shapes before our eyes turned back into the sun, into the sun in our eyes
We lied to ourselves for awhile
in our usual style
Now I wish we could ride, we wish we could lie to ourselves again
And we tried, we tried, we tried with all our might
we tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong, headlong in our way...
we tried so hard...
we tried so hard...
yeah we tried so hard...
