What if we're too black and blue
To spot our latest bruise
Me and you, the heavy bag
For here for now

For us one thing to do
See if this'll work for you
Cry and hue, let's push our way
Above the sound
Over sideways down, above the sound
Over sideways down, above the sound

What if we bear it with a grin
To take it on the chin
Me and you, point one way
For the ground

For all our heads may spin
See if we can look within
To find another way
Above the sound
Word gets round, goin' down, above the sound
Word gets round, goin' down, above the sound
