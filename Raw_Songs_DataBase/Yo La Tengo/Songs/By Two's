Wander along together
By the edge of the river
Hush little baby, don't you cry
Cross over to the other side of the water

You
And I
We could live in peace like this
In peace like this

Gaze up at the moon hanging low in the sky
Onlookers appear around us
Gaze up at the moon hanging low in the sky
As we slip away into the darkness

You
And I
We could live in peace like this
In peace like this

You
And I
Belong in dreams like this
You
And I
We could live in dreams like this
In dreams like this
