On the verge of somewhere he wanted to be 
Thought he'd take a chance, thought he'd take a dive 
He wandered away, wandered away from his nothing life 
He wandered away, wandered away from his nothing life 
Feeling sad and laughed at, misunderstood 
Just how dry have I become 
He wandered away, wandered away from his nothing life 
He wandered away, wandered away from his nothing life 
Passed the edge of nowhere 
he ever thought he'd be 
He pressed down, and then he took the bait. 
He wandered away, wandered away from his nothing life, his nothing life
