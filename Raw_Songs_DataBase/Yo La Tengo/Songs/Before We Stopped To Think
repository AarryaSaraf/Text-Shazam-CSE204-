There are black pots hangin' 'round the sink
Before we stop to think
We're not the ones that need a drink
Before we stop to think

And we stop to catch our breath
And we stopped fearing our death
That's when we die
And we stopped to tear apart the clock
From our beating heart

We would write our songs slow
And we tried to speed them up
We would write our songs soft
Then we'd try to make them tough

And we stop to catch our breath
And we stopped fearing our death
That's when we die
And we stopped to tear apart the clock
From our beating heart

We finish more than we could start
And we're smarter than you'd ever think
Now I think I need a drink
Cause for a cause I never named

And we stop to catch our breath
And we stopped fearing our death
That's when we die
And we stopped to tear apart the clock
From our beating heart
