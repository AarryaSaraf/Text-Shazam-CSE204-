Hey Mr. Tough
Don't you think we've suffered enough?
Why don't you meet me on the dance floor
When it's time to talk tough?

And if you need to tell me something once
You won't have to say it twice
And if you ask for a nickel
I'm gonna hand you a dime

And we'll forget about our problems if only for a little while
We'll leave our worries in the corner, leave them in a great big pile
Pretend everything can be alright

Hey Mrs. Blue
Time to think of something new
Please pause from spinning those hips
To the old soft shoe

And if you wanna last the rest of the night
There's nothing better I have to do
And if I tell you something
You won't have to ask if it's true

And we'll forget about our problems if only for a little while
We'll leave our worries in the corner, leave them in a heaping pile
Pretend everything can be alright

Alone and uptight on Saturday night
And in my room
I'm hiding at a crowded party
The record's playing for just me and you

Hey Mr. Tough
Don't you think we've suffered enough?
Why don't you meet me on the dance floor
When it's time to talk tough?

And if you need to tell me something once
You won't have to say it twice
And if you ask for a nickel
I'm gonna hand you a dime

And we'll forget about our problems if only for a little while
And leave our worries in the corner, leave them in a heaping pile
Pretend everything can be alright
Pretend everything can be alright
