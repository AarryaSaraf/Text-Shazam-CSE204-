Speeding motorcycle
Wont you change me
In a world of funny changes
Speeding motorcycle
Wont you change me

Speeding motorcycle
Of my heart
Speeding motorcycle
Always changing me
Speeding motorcycle
Don't you drive recklessly
Speeding motorcycle
Of my heart

Many girls have taken you out for a ride, 
hurt you deep inside but you never slowed down

Speeding motorcycle
Of my heart
Speeding motorcycle
Lets be smart
Because we don't want a wreck
We can do alot of tricks
We don't have to break our legs
To get our kicks
Speeding motorcycle
The road is ours
Speeding motorcycle
Lets speed some more

Because we don't need reason and we don't need logic 
because we got feelin' and were damn proud of it

Speeding motorcycle
There's nothing you can do
Speeding motorcycle
I love you
Speeding motorcycle
Lets just go
Speeding motorcycle
Lets go, lets go, lets go
