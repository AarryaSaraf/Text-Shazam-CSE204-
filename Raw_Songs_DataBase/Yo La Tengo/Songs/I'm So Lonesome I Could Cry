Did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
That midnight train rides alone
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Did you ever see a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the cloud
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
It means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of the falling stars
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry

And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
