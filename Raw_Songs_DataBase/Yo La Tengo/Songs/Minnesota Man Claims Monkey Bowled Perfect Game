He used to love to watch me
So I taught him how to bowl
He has fantastic upper body strength
And excellent control
He used to practice daily
And developed perfect aim
Which made out for him good
The day he bowled a perfect game
I didn't actually watch that day
But trusting him is not hard
He's an honest little monkey
And he showed me his scorecard
