It wasnt it more than a minute
That first one was the test
He was listening but i dont think he heard the rest
It was easy to fall, but not easy to take a stand
With the sound of her voice or the touch of her hand

Everyones heard the reasons why
A kid would let the poison creep inside
He said he wasn't scared, but you know he lied
The way some people die

He doesnt think of tomorrow
and he seldom looks back
When he did he saw failure
and a future so black
So, he sees himself through sad eyes
That have never caught the look of love
He'll never see what hes giving up

Everyones heard the reasons why
A kid would let the poison creep inside
He said he wasn't scared, but you know he lied
The way some people die

You might think hes a victim
He just thinks its a guess
Its not the question, its who you ask
and the boats fly on friday
and you're never gonna see him again
It wasn't love that did him in

Everyones heard the reasons why
A kid would let the poison creep inside
He said he wasn't scared, but you know he lied
The way some people die
