Hold it in your arms
Be still, be there
I'll hold you in mine
Before we run, we can start to sing

I know it's hard
Believing in all of this
And then we run
Running away from here
Running away from here
Running away to stay

Orange clouds before the sky rolls back
Before we lose our earth
Before we escape
Cross the dotted line

Too fast and wise
Slowly like the storm
Be still, be there
Running away from there
Running away from there
Running until we're there

Take me to the place, the lonely place
Take me out beyond the stress
Speak to me words we can't erase
Take me there, it's only us
