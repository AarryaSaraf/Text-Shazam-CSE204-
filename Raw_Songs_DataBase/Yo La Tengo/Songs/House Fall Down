I met a tugboat captain 
The stories he could tell 
Of a sailor's life in the shallow water 
The saddest yarn he'd spin, it happened on dry land 
He saw his house fall down 
It shed it's bricks and it dropped to the ground 
Ah, well, made him feel so bad, 
he thinks about it and he crys. 
Ah, well, made him feel so mad, 
Don't want to think about it now. 
You never walk out, or even look away 
He had a house torn down, swipe a deed and start breaking ground 
Drop some mortar, we'll be rippin' up your asphalt 
Another house goes down, and another house, 
and another drops to the ground, drops to the ground
