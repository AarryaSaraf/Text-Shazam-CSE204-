She's the youngest girl on record
To be awarded a degree
She started school at two years old
And finished it at three
She used to have to crawl to school
Before she'd learned to walk
She had to type her questions then
Before she'd learned to talk
At school she loves biology
History and math
At home, she loves her dolly
And the ducky in her bath
