// Here To Fall //

There will be some happy endings
There'll be dreams that don't come true
But in the times ahead, there's love and dread coming
All in all, it makes it that much harder for you

I know you're worried
I'm worried too
But if you're ready, I'm here to fall with you
What else is there for us to do?

You'll push back against the sorrow
Wait for the sun and we get through
And if it glares too bright, we'll pull the shades but dim the lights
That's just the way it is, but it makes it that much harder for you

I know you're worried
I'm worried too
But if you're ready, I'm here to fall with you
What else is there for us to do?

What else is there for us to do?

I know you're worried
I'm worried too
But if you're ready, I'm here to fall with you
What else is there for us to do?

I know you're worried
I'm worried too
But if you're ready, I'm here to fall with you
I'm here to fall with you

I'm here to fall with you
I'm here to fall with you
What else is there for us to do?

// Avalon Or Someone Very Similar //

Avalon, how did these things happen?
Avalon, tell me all you know
The perfect crime, we laughed about it, 
laughed the whole night through
When we were caught, it was because of you
Talkin bout all that we once knew

Avalon, the clock is falling back now
Avalon, we'd be if we could
You used to say "the water's fine, nevermind the view"
I didn't mind as long as I have you
Talkin bout all that we've been through

Somedays, somedays we might be tired of being tired
We claim, we claim to be one of one of one

We didn't know the things we said
Would turn out untrue
The day would come when I'd be somewhere new and what about you
Times have changed for me and times have changed for you, for you
Talkin bout all that we once knew

// By Two's //

Wander along together
By the edge of the river
Hush little baby, don't you cry
Cross over to the other side of the water

You
And I
We could live in peace like this
In peace like this

Gaze up at the moon hanging low in the sky
Onlookers appear around us
Gaze up at the moon hanging low in the sky
As we slip away into the darkness

You
And I
We could live in peace like this
In peace like this

You
And I
Belong in dreams like this
You
And I
We could live in dreams like this
In dreams like this

// Nothing To Hide //

We all decide 
How to draw the line 
We've all got something to hide 

Stairs suprise 
Glazes of any size 
We've all got something to hide 
We've all got something to hide 
Well wait, wait  
We're gonna see what comes after
We're gonna see what comes after
Wait wait, harder not faster
Harder not faster

We might do time
Set us stright like [?]
We've all got something to hide

Clear the drive 
Morsels not in sight
We've all got something to hide

Well wait, wait
We're gonna see what comes after
We're gonna see what comes after
Wait wait, harder not faster
Harder not faster

Well wait, wait
We're gonna see what comes after
We're gonna see what comes after
Wait wait, harder not faster
Harder not faster

We all decide 
We all like to draw the line
We've all got something to hide
We've all got something to hide

// Periodically Double Or Triple //

Never read Proust
Seems a little too long
Never used the hammer
Without somehow using it wrong
I've got time on my hands
That I can't wash off
I'm guzzling vitamin C but
I can't shake this cough

Walls are closing in
They often do
I'm seeing double and triple
Does this ever happen to you?
I don't have to make it rain
But I never argue with improving the view

Never wear a helmet
When I'm riding a bike
Never recall a face
To me, they all look alike
I've got a hole in my brain
Where what I meant to say lives
I'm livin' in the past
The gift that gives and gives

Walls are closing in
They often do
I'm seeing double and triple
Does this ever happen to you?
I don't have to make it rain
But I never argue with improving the view

Sometimes
In the future tense
I hope that you are safer
Put up an electric fence
Then and only then
We can all get along
Get it down in writing
Judge Judy tell me if I'm wrong
Walls are closing in
They often do
I'm seeing double and triple
Does this ever happened to you?
I don't have to make it rain
But I never argue with improving the view

// If It's True //

I hear the things you say
I read your mind and I understand
Baby the plans you make somehow got off the track
Maybe so or we just forgot to plan

If it's true
I don't mind
There's a million other things that keep me up at night
Maybe it's not quite right
But we'll find out
If it's true

The coast is never clear
Answers always beyond our reach
And though it's not my way won't you help me try
Let's make jam when life gives us a peach

If it's true
I don't mind
There's a million other things that keep me up at night
Maybe it's not quite right
But we'll find out
If it's true

With every passing year the end draws near
Another hope that's smashed
Tell me it doesn't matter anyway
And I don't feel let down
It's always better when you are near

Won't you try a little bit harder?
I could try a little bit more
If you could only stop thinking about all of
Maybe we'll find just what we're looking for

If it's true
I don't mind
There's a million other things that keep me up at night
Baby it's not quite right
But we'll find out
If it's true

I hear the things you say
I read your mind and I understand
Baby the plans you make somehow got off the track

// I'm On My Way //

Sun shines through the window
There's nothing I could do
I tried to be brooding and dark
But it all fell through

I made you wait such a long time
I had to find it myself
I had to find it myself
In an only child's dream
And I will let go
And now the time has come
To me

[Chorus:]
Just for a day
Just for an hour
For awhile
I won't delay
I'm on my way
I won't be late
I'll be there
Baby that's all

I use my imagination
As much as I can
But all I can think of is you
Can I hold your hand?

I never knew what a difference
A difference could make
Why don't we go for a ride?
Or just float into space
And that's what I thought

[Chorus:]
Just for a day
Just for an hour
For awhile
I won't delay
I'm on my way
I won't be late
I'll be there
Baby that's all

Why don't we float off in to space?
For a day
Just for an hour
For awhile
I won't delay
I'm on my way
I won't be late
I'll be there
Baby that's all

// When It's Dark //

Spun out in the world
Just in sync to break out of my mind
Out of this in the world
Nothing seems to take me out of my mind

Night time in
But with wind
Cold winds always push me back inside
I'll hide

When the sun comes in
Will you smile at me
And call my name
When it's dark
Will I come apart?

This day where we've been alone
I can't seem to get out of my mind
We'll win this race alone
Sometimes it really drives me out of my mind

Night time in
But with wind
Cold winds always push me back inside
I'll hide

When the sun comes in
Will you smile at me
And call my name
When it's dark
Will I come apart?

And when I see you
See you far up higher than me
I can hear it turn and look the other way

When the sun comes in
Will you smile at me
And call my name
But the rain she comes
Let the clouds come in
And the clouds will break
When the stars are overhead
Will the clouds come in
And carry me away?
When it's dark and it rains
Will I come apart?

// More Stars Than There Are In Heaven //

We'll walk hand in hand
Never understand
Take the hidden wish to death
And laugh and laugh and catch your breath
And forget that every word's been said
We'll walk hand in hand

We'll walk hand in hand
As the world expands
The pair must face the final fling
The hook and ladder, a fatal swing
The sign looks missed, the marks we've placed
The playful grin that won't erase
We'll walk hand in hand

We'll walk hand in hand
Across a foreign land
See your face with sultry pearls
In heaven snow makes caroler girls
Until when any burnoff glows ablaze
We'll walk hand in hand

We'll walk hand in hand
Never as we planned
And even those we never knew
Fast they disappear from view
Fading world without a price
Right before our very eyes
Melts before our very eyes
Dies before our very eyes

And even though we feel the burn
We careen past the heavy turn
Push, then pull to scale the hill
Then miss the cliff, don't take the spill
Until we can't withstand
We'll walk hand in hand

Running from the pull of tide
Fumbling from the creeping time
Running out...of whim and rhyme
We'll walk hand in hand
Till we understand
And everything to be despised
Right before our very eyes
Forced before our very eyes
Dies before our very eyes
We'll walk hand in hand (we'll walk hand, hand in hand)
We'll walk hand in hand (we'll walk hand, hand in hand)
We'll walk hand in hand (we'll walk hand, hand in hand)
We'll walk hand in hand (we'll walk hand, hand in hand)
Hand in hand (we'll walk hand, hand in hand)

// The Fireside //

And if I go
Leaving much of life
Somewhere
Beyond the fireside
Somewhere

And when I'm gone
Lemme imagine life
Sometime
Please think of me
Please think of me
