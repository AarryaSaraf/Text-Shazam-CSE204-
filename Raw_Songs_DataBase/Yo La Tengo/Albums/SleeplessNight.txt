Album: SleeplessNight

// Blues Stay Away From Me //

Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
I don't know why you keep on haunting me

Love was never meant for me
True love was never meant for me
It seems somehow we never can agree

Life is full of misery
Dreams are like a memory
Bringing back your love that used to be

Tears so many I can't see
Years don't mean a thing to me
Time goes by and still I can't be free

// Wasn't Born To Follow //

Oh I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crescents flowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountains
And wander through the forest
Where the the trees have leaves of prisms
And break the light in colors
That no one knows the names of

And when it's time I'll go and wait
Beside a legendary fountain
'Til I see your form reflected
In its clear and jeweled waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our vision
Flow into one another

I will want to dive beneath
The white cascading waters
She may beg, she may plead
She may argue with my logic
And mention all the things I learned
That really have no value
In the end she will surely know
I wasn't born to follow

// Roll On Babe //

Roll on babe
Don't you roll so slow?
'N' when the wheel don't turn
You don't roll no more

I dreamt last night
Ol' Lola was dead
I saw the apron string
All around her head

Roll on babe
Don't you roll so slow?
'N' when the wheel don't turn
You don't roll no more

Well I jumped a train
When I wanna go
And for where she's bound
Well, I don't wanna know

Roll on babe
Don't you roll so slow?
When the wheel don't turn
Well, you won't roll no more

Well, I've been drinkin' gin
I drank some whiskey too
Well, I got hooked
Oh, what you gonna do

Roll on babe
Don't you roll so slow
When the wheel don't turn
Well, you don't roll no more

// It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry //

Well, I ride on a mail train, baby
Can't buy a thrill
Well, I been up all night
Leanin' on the windowsill
Well, if I die
On top of the hill
And if I don't make it
You know my baby will

Don't the moon look good, mama
Shining through the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama
Flaggin' down the "Double E?"
Don't the sun look good
Goin' down over the sea?
But don't my gal look fine
When she's comin' after me?

Now the wintertime is coming
The windows are filled with frost
I went to tell everybody
But I could not get across
Well, I want to be your lover, baby
I don't want to be your boss
Don't say I never warned you
When your train gets lost
