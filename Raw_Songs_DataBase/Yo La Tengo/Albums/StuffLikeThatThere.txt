// The Ballad Of Red Buckets //

I wonder what's on your mind
I wonder what's on your mind
Look around and see
What it does to me
I wonder what's on your mind

Think I'll throw it all away
Think I'll throw it all away
If words come back to me
Pretend that I don't see
I'll just cover my eyes and stare

And it'll surely come
And it'll surely come
Here it comes again

Think I'll throw it all away
Think I'll throw it all away
If words come back to me
Pretend that I don't see
I'll just cover my eyes and stare

And it will surely come
It will surely come
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again

// Deeper Into Movies //

Late at night, gazing out into the late at night
I see deep in the world till I open my eyes
Every day brakes screech outside my window
Those crashing cars never seem to collide

Sometimes when I'm staring out my window
Catch the stars and watch as they go by
I've been sending signals tune to outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky - and it blows my mind

Every day I'm drawn to my window
I can hear it if I open my eyes

Sometimes flashing lights seem so familiar
I know I've seen them circling me at night
I've been getting messages from outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky - and it blows my mind

Every day the restlessness takes over me
I can hear it as I open my eyes
I've been getting messages from outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky - and it blows my mind

Like a finger in the sky... [repeat]

// All Your Secrets //

All of the thoughts we thought would stay unsaid
Have made their way here instead, before the riot
As the days ahead become behind
Replace the tape as we rewind, before the riot

Tell me all your secrets
Say it slow and clear, so you don't have to speak twice
And if there's things that I'm afraid to know
Should have learned them years ago before the riot

I don't believe we're hopeless as we fear
Or as good as we appear before the riot
I can be strong inside your sleeping eyes
Unafraid of truth, unafraid of lies, before the riot

Think of what we're missing
And then take that thought and put it out of your head
And if we can stop a restless night
Won't give up without a fight before the riot

I can feel the time is coming, sure it's coming soon
Do what we do, hiding out from view
Sure it's coming, say the worst should happen
Would we plan for that even if we could?

And if we can stop a restless night
Won't give up without a fight before the riot
Here it comes, before the riot

// My Heart's Not In It //

Since you left me I've been out with other guys
But they don't see the love light shining in my eyes
And when they want to kiss goodnight
I just can't seem to do it right

My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you

Cause when I think that someone else has won my heart
I find it's only wishful thinking on my part
And there's just nothing I can do
To get that feeling I had with you

My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you

I don't know just what my friends are telling you
But if they say I'm doing fine, it's just not true
I may run with the crowd and stay out late
But baby let me set you straight

My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you

My heart's not in it, oh no

// Rickety //

Way past late, rising sun
Four times four, one plus one
The path link home, the wait and see
Five times five, T minus three
Consult the map around the bend
Retrace our steps and until then
Through it all, we're on our feet
But rickety

Shady browns, setting sun
Stubby Kaye, Danny Dunn
Broken glass between our toes
Earl the Pearl Monroe
Nothing's gone and nothing lasts
The doors ajar and closing fast
Through it all, we're on our feet
But rickety

Steering gear to the side
Holding on, holding on to the other side

Dreaming on the astral plane
Where our worlds collide
Offering a love in vain
Holding on, holding on to the other side

Somewhere road, sometime soon
Teddy bears, Daniel Boone
More or less stick to the plan
Rag dolls, and Horace Mann
Drink until we're straight again
Make a fist and count to ten
Through it all we're on our feet
But rickety

// I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry //

Did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
That midnight train rides alone
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Did you ever see a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the cloud
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
It means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of the falling stars
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry

And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry

// Friday I'm In Love //

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate

I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Thursday, never looking back
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Oh Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday I'm in love

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate

Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love

Mondays you can fall apart
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love

// Before We Stopped To Think //

There are black pots hangin' 'round the sink
Before we stop to think
We're not the ones that need a drink
Before we stop to think

And we stop to catch our breath
And we stopped fearing our death
That's when we die
And we stopped to tear apart the clock
From our beating heart

We would write our songs slow
And we tried to speed them up
We would write our songs soft
Then we'd try to make them tough

And we stop to catch our breath
And we stopped fearing our death
That's when we die
And we stopped to tear apart the clock
From our beating heart

We finish more than we could start
And we're smarter than you'd ever think
Now I think I need a drink
Cause for a cause I never named

And we stop to catch our breath
And we stopped fearing our death
That's when we die
And we stopped to tear apart the clock
From our beating heart

// Butchie's Tune //

Don't give me a place for my memories to stay
Don't show me an inn or a light to find the way
I ain't got time for the things on your mind
And I'm leaving you today on my way

Please don't you cry when the time to part has come
It's not for what you've said or anything that you've done
I've got to go anywhere, anytime
And I'm leaving, gone today, on my way, I'm going home

Please don't stick around to see me when I'm feeling low
Don't pass the cards to me to deal the crashing blow
I'll leave and close the door so you won't see me go
When I'm leaving, gone today, I'm on my way

I'll walk away like a shadow in the night
I won't give cause for you to feel we have to fight
I'll make it easy so you won't really
Quite know I'm leaving you today on my way and now I'm going

// Automatic Doom //

Is there an automatic doom that's waiting for you?
Can there already be a bullet with your name emblazoned boldly?
As you lead your life with anxious and repetitive behavior
Automatic doom

Is there a magic floating chalice waiting for you?
And would you be depressed if you determined that your quest is over
And you lead your life with anxious and repetitive behavior
Automatic doom

Is there a crystal cosmic sparrow floating away?
Is there a neo-pterodactyl coming to prey?
Are you prepared to see the bad things that you say emblazoned boldly
In gold letters on your tomb?

// Awhileaway //

How do you turn from fear
How do you make dark thoughts disappear
When nowhere to go feels right
Maybe I can hide from the night
Maybe I'll just turn on my mind

So it's you and me
Hard times pass peacefully
Is that true? We'll see
Maybe once or twice in awhileaway

My heart skips every time
Your sleepy grin, your still closed eyes
I don't need anymore
I'm sure I've said all that before
Please don't laugh when I say it some more

When you and me
We don't even have to agree
Is that true? We'll see
Maybe once or twice in awhileaway

Things get better sometimes
But when we're not in
Takes forever, it's in the sign
If we're together

Please don't laugh when I say it some more

With you and me
Hard times pass peacefully
Is that true? We'll see
Maybe I'll believe what you say or
Maybe I can quiet my brain
Maybe once or twice in awhileaway

// I Can Feel the Ice Melting //

You are so distant, you're so all alone
You possess a reputation for being cold
Oh but lately when I look at you I see a trace of a smile
Oh know that I see a spark of interest for me in your eyes
And I'm not really worried cause

I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip
I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip

You always keep your feelings to yourself
You never share a moment with no one else
Oh but now it's like electricity every time our eyes meet
Your resistance is weakening and pretty soon you will be
My sweet baby cause

I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip
I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip

Your disguise is transparent and baby I can see right through you
Ooh I know that you care for me and lover I care for you
So baby stop pretending cause

I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip
I can feel the ice melting in your eye
Can almost feel it drip
Can almost feel it drip

// Naples //

In the morning light
Your eyes are bright in the sun
Have you heard what I heard?
The traffic chirp like a bird

It's a symphony
I need you close to me
Maybe I'm dreaming, I'm awake
And the horns are singing for our sake

The night is alive
We don't need nothing to do
The night is alive
The buildings get lost in the mist of a view
And the light pounces high off the city sky

We don't need nothing to do
We don't need nothing to do
