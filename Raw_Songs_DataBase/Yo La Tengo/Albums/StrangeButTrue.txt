// Helpful Monkey Wallpapers Entire Home //

A man taught his little monkey
How to help out with the chores
Together they sanded the woodwork
And painted all the windows and doors

They stained athe wood in the bedroom
And laid new tile in the hall
Then the monkey tried, all by himself,
To put paper on the wall

There was nobody home to help him
So he thought up his own little trick
He wasn't sure what he was doing
Or how to make the wallpaper stick

Instead of using paste
He stuck it up with monkey spit
Now the house smells like bananas
Wherever paper is hung in it

Helpful monkey wallpapers entire home

// Texas Man Abducted By Aliens For Outer Space Joy Ride //

They cruised around the universe
They were looking for girls, I guess
All I could think of was:
How did I ever get myself into this mess?

I didn't have much money
They didn't have much class
I didn't even want to go
And they made me pay for gas

They swerved around the planets
At a thousand times a minute
Singings songs, I sang along
But my heart wasn't in it

They dropped me off at home
And in a wink they were gone
They didn't even apologize
For the skid marks on my lawn

They cruised around the universe
They were looking for girls, I guess
All I could think of was:
How did I ever get myself into this mess?

I didn't have much money
They didn't have much class
I didn't even want to go
And they made me pay for gas

They said that some day they might be back
I wish they would let me be
In fact, if I don't ever see them
It'll be just fine with me

// National Sports Association Hires Retired English Professor To Name New Wrestling Holds //

The National Association Of Sports Administration
Had a problem with one of its games.
Some of the wrestlers were winning their matches
With holds that didn't even have names.
The ringside announcer and most of the fans
Were surprised and completely confused,
So they hired a retired college English professor
To name the new holds that were used.

A Slow Dance With Trouble
Appointment With Pain
And a Dunk In The Devil's Teacup
King Tut's Crunch
And the Rubber Wrist Twist
Were all names the professor thought up.

And then he came up with the Slow Poke
(That's a wind-up and slow motion slap)
And the Porcupine Hug
ANd the Polar Bear Rub
And the Snap-crackle-pop-crackle-snap
The Lip Pull Hip Throw
And Tongue Twister
The Chin Pinch
And High Diving Splat
The Hair Pulling Eye Poking Nose Tweak
And something called Shaving The Cat.

After naming new holds every day for a week
He got kind of carried away
He started to talk the same way at home
Every time he had something to say.
Like:
"Darling, please pass me the tiny white balls
From the table top tumbler vault."
When all that he really meant to say was
"Honey, please pass me the salt."

// Dedicated Thespian Has Teeth Pulled To Play Newborn Baby In High School Play //

He's very very very dedicated to his art.
He had the dentist pull his teeth
So he could get the part.
Now everything he does,
He does as practice for the play.
He kicks his feet and throws a fit
When things don't go his way.
Instead of sleeping in a bed,
He's sleeping in a crib.
And at the dinner table now,
He dribbles on his bib.
He puts his fingers in his food,
Then drops it on the floor.
Then he spills his cup of milk,
And screams for more.
His mother says his acting style
Is getting on her nerves.
He'll either give up,
Or get the spanking he deserves.

// Three-Year-Old Genius Graduates High School At Top Of Her Class //

She's the youngest girl on record
To be awarded a degree
She started school at two years old
And finished it at three
She used to have to crawl to school
Before she'd learned to walk
She had to type her questions then
Before she'd learned to talk
At school she loves biology
History and math
At home, she loves her dolly
And the ducky in her bath

// Embarrassed Teen Accidentally Uses Valuable Rare Postage Stamp //

He scribbled down a little note
To send news home from camp
And stuffed it in an envelope
And hunted for a stamp
His roommate had a scrapbook-full
Just sitting on a shelf
He didn't think his pal would mind
So he just helped himself

He had made mistakes before
In fact, he made more than his share
But this one was a big one
Because the stamp he took was rare
His roommate didn't mind it though
In fact, it made him laugh
For the stamp was worth half a grand
Insured for a grand and a half

// Principal Punishes Students With Bad Impressions And Tired Jokes //

Whenever students misbehave
Or break the rules in school
They have to watch the principal
Acting like a fool

He thinks he's very funny
He thinks he's really clever
He makes us sit and watch
For what seems like forever

We sit on hardwood bleachers
In the auditorium
While he acts like Jerry Lewis
But his jokes are twice as dumb

The punishment should fit the crime
That ought to be the rule
This punishment's a little too
Unusual and cruel

// Retired Grocer Constructs Tiny Mount Rushmore Entirely Of Cheese //

He'd been retired for a week or so
When his interest in art was renewed
He found he had extra time on his hands
And he kind of missed working with food
So he made a tiny Mount Rushmore
Constructed completely of cheese
Then he added a cute little forest scene
Made out of noodles and peas
Next came a little log cabin
He built using sausage-link logs
But sadly the whole thing was swallowed
By a couple of art-loving dogs

// X-Ray Reveals Doctor Left Wristwatch Inside Patient //

I'd gone to the hospital
For simple surgery,
When the slippery-fingered doctor
Dropped his watch inside of me.
He tried to get it out.
He tried and tried and tried.
He couldn't get it!
So he sewed it up inside.
Now the ticking drives me crazy.
I put cotton in my ear.
The battery in that watch
Is guaranteed for years.
The doctor has a tip for me
To help relieve the shock.
He said, "Be glad it's a watch,
And not a cuckoo clock."

// Clumsy Grandmother Serves Delicious Dessert By Mistake #2 //

There were close to sixty candles
Burning on her birthday cake
She meant to blow them out
But blew them over by mistake
They flew across the table
Scattered everywhere
One landed in my cup of juice
One landed on my chair
One landed in my ice cream bowl
Yet it wasn't wasted
It made a Baked Alaska
Better than I'd ever tasted

// Retired Woman Starts New Career In Monkey Fashions //

She made little tiny socks and slacks
And shorts and shirts and shoes
They'd be just right for a monkey
But too small for me and you
Her husband and her neighbors
And her friends all think she's funny
But she'll be rich if she can find
A monkey with some money

// Circus Strongman Runs For Pta President //

The sword-swallowing circus strongman
And his snake-charming tattooed wife
Decided that they would become regular parents
And just lead a regular life

They bought a big house in the country
With a hammock, a hill and a hedge
There's a swing on the porch, a pond in the yard
And a white picket fence around the edge

And they lead a regular life

The sword-swallowing circus strongman
And his snake-charming tattooed wife
Decided that they would become regular parents
And just lead a regular life

Now they're just a regular family now
Having regular family fun
With their fire-eating, fan-dancing daughter
And their dog-faced contortionist son

They lead a regular life

Each weekend now, they wash the car
And barbecue and jog
They bought a great big TV set
And a little Scottie dog

// High School Shop Class Constructs Bicycle Built For 26 //

Things got a little out of hand
In their high school metal shop
They constructed a bicycle built for two
Then decided they wouldn't stop
They welded together a number of bikes
So everyone had his own seat
After months of planning and welding and building
The project was finally complete
It had dozens and dozens of pedals
And plenty of headlights and bells
The frame and all the fenders
Were painted in pretty pastels
But it can't be removed from the classroom
The doorway is not very wide
And instead of the bikes lining up in a row
They connected them all side by side

// Clumsy Grandmother Serves Delicious Dessert By Mistake #1 //

She was too close to candles burning on her birthday cake
She meant to blow them out but blew them over by mistake
They flew across the table, bounced and scattered everywhere
One landed in my cup of juice, one landed on my chair
One landed in my ice cream bowl and yet it wasn't wasted
It made a Baked Alaska better than I'd ever tasted

// Ohio Town Saved From Killer Bees By Hungry Vampire Bats //

It used to seem so wonderful
To sit out in the breeze
Until the town was overrun
By stinging killer bees
The stinging pests
Were unwelcome guests
They had the town unnerved
'Til the mayor imported vampire bats
And announced that dinner was served
On the edge of town
Hanging upside down
From each limb of every tree
Sway giant, dangerous vampire bats
With their bellies full of bees
But now they've got to find a way
To rid the town of bats
So, they're thinking of importing
Hungry rabid mountain cats

// Nevada Man Invents Piano With 21 Extra Keys //

Most pianos have 88 keys
But his has a hundred and nine
It plays extra low and extra high
And it all sounds extra fine
The low notes sound like a buffalo's snore
The middle notes sound like bees
The other end of the piano plays
A note like a hummingbird's sneeze
But he's not satisfied just yet
He wants one twice as big
It would roar like a summer thunderstorm
And screech like a squealing pig

// Clever Chemist Makes Chewing Gum From Soap //

He's hard at work in a secret lab
Making soap into chewing gum
He's trying hard to improve the taste
And he's hoping a breakthrough will come
For years now, he's worked on his formula
And some day, it will come

He's hard at work in a secret lab
Making soap into chewing gum
He's trying hard to improve the taste
And he's hoping a breakthrough will come
For years now, he's worked on his formula
But all that he has for his troubles
Is something tastes exactly like soap
But works pretty good for blowing bubbles

Someday it will come
His big breakthrough

// Minnesota Man Claims Monkey Bowled Perfect Game //

He used to love to watch me
So I taught him how to bowl
He has fantastic upper body strength
And excellent control
He used to practice daily
And developed perfect aim
Which made out for him good
The day he bowled a perfect game
I didn't actually watch that day
But trusting him is not hard
He's an honest little monkey
And he showed me his scorecard

// Ingenious Scientist Invents Car Of The Future //

The bean-powered car comes with nose plugs
When it starts up, you'll see what for
If you're standing down wind while it's running
The aroma is hard to ignore

The gas is caught in a funnel
Attached to a hole in the seat
The fumes flow out through the tailpipe
And leave stinkbombs all over the street
