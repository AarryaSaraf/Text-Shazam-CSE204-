Album: Shenanigans

// Suffocate //

3 A.M., I'm drunk again
My head is standing underneath my feet
So make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Sedatives and dizzy spells
And spilling my guts out under my feet
So make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off

Well, slipped into a coma once again
Where's my organ donor? Lend a hand

So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
And I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate

One night stands and cheap regrets
I take another drag off of my cigarette
So stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off
One last stop for a one track mind
Just give me shelter, give me, give me something
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off

Well, slipped into a coma once again
Where's my organ donor? Lend a hand

So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
And I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate

So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
And I know now that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
And I know now that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate

// Desensitized //

Clenching my teeth tight
My head is like a sponge
Give it to me free

I wanna get ripped off
And drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck
On the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves
It all amuses me
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell
Another wise ingrate

Bring me blood and pain
Of a stranger's fate
Give it all away
Give it to me now
I'm desensitized
I wanna watch a bomb
Blow the masses high

I wanna get ripped off
And drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck
On the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves
It all amuses me
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell
Another wise ingrate

Bring me blood and pain
Of a stranger's fate
Give it all away

I wanna get ripped off
And drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck
On the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves
It all amuses me
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell
Another wise ingrate

// You Lied //

You got a problem you just can't hide
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath is taking up all the air
Your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head

Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse, you lied

Your mother allowed you just one white lie
But now she's dead and she left you with a problem
Pinocchio has pierced your tongue
Your nose is growing into the third dimension

Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse, you lied (Uh, you lied)

Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse, you lied

// Outsider //

I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of everything
Everything you know
Everything you know
It disturbs me so
I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of everything
Everything you know
Everything you know
It disturbs me so

Everybody's gotta push me
Push me around
Everybody tried to put me
Tried to put me down

All messed up, everyone
I've already had all my fun
More troubles are gonna come
I've already had all my fun
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Everybody tried to push me
Push me around
Everybody tried to put me
Tried to put me down

I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of everything
Everything you know
Everything you know
It disturbs me so

// Don't Wanna Fall In Love //

Don't want to have you hangin'
Around me like a leech
I think you're just a problem
So stay the hell away from me
Because I don't believe in you

And now, I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Don't wanna fall in love

Don't need security
I ain't no dog without a bone
Don't have no time for love
So stay the fuck away from me
Because I don't believe in you

And now, I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Don't wanna fall in love

This may sound a little rough
Don't wanna fall in love
This may sound a little rough
Don't wanna fall in love
This may sound a little fucked
Don't wanna fall in love

// I Want To Be On TV //

Wanna be a pretty boy
Wanna go on Solid Gold
Wanna date a millionaire
Wanna make people stare

I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TV

Studio 54
Gonna be out on the floor
Wanna make people dance
Gonna take off my pants

I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TV

Gonna wanna make a scene
Gonna get some free cocaine
Wanna wear my Calvin Klein's
Emmy Award will be all mine

I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TV

// Scumbag //

You come around every now and then
Your clothes look different, but you're still the same
Why else would you come here?
Scumbag on a mission
You're telling me that it's been a while
Shit eating grin and a brand new life
Somebody let you come here
Scumbag with permission

Never thought I'd see the likes of you around this place
What's the special occasion? Did you run out of friends?

Here you are coming 'round again
And things are different, but you still pretend
You've got a reason to come here
Scumbag with ambition
And now you're telling me that things will change
And that you'll be leaving in a couple days
You're gonna change the world someday
Scumbag with a vision

It must be nice to know you got it all figured out
But from where I'm sittin'
It's just the same thing again and again

You need to stop to think before you open up your mouth
'Cause every time you do
It's the same thing again and again

// Tired Of Waiting For You //

I'm so tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul, I had nobody 'til I met you
But you, keeping me waiting, all of the time
What can I do?

It's your life, and you can do what you want
Do what you like, but please don't keep me waitin'
Please don't keep me waitin'
Cause I'm so tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul, I had nobody 'til I met you
But you, keeping me waiting, all of the time
What can I do?

It's your life, and you can do what you want
Do what you like, but please don't keep me waitin'
Please don't keep me waitin'

Cause I'm so tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you
For you
For you

// Sick Of Me //

Why can't you just admit it? You've had it, you're sick of me
You're fed up with all my bad habits, you're sick of me
To your lies, you've become so desensitized, sick of me
Lost regrets, and you say that you're mad, and feel sick of me

Wandering out the door
I am on to you
You're coming back for more
Am I losing you?

Like a dog that just pissed on your barbecue, sick of me
Losing faith, and you still don't know what to do, sick of me
Loss of health, now you hate everything and you're sick of me
It's a waste, but we still keep on trying, you're sick of me

Wandering out the door
I am on to you
You're coming back for more
Am I losing you?

So you got your problems
So you got it alright
Do you have a conscience?
Do you have a reason?
Now I'm sick of you too

Wandering out the door
I am on to you
You're coming back for more
Am I losing you?
