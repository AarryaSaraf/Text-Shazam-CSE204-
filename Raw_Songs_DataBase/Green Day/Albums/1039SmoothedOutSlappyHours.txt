// At The Library //

Ha!

Hey there lookin' at me
Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don't have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit grey

Staring across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

What is it that drives me mad?
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore?
What makes me feel so much pain?
That makes me go so insane
What is it about you that I adore?

Staring across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

Why did you have to leave so soon?
Why did you have to walk away?
Oh, well, it happened again
She walked away with her boyfriend
Maybe we'll meet again someday
Maybe we'll meet again someday
Maybe we'll meet again someday
Someday! Go!

// Don't Leave Me //

I'll go for miles
Till I find you
You say you want to leave me
But you can't choose
I've gone through pain
Every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane
Something I can't fight

Don't leave me
Don't leave me

A blank expression
Covering your face
I'm looking for directions
For out of this place
I start to wonder
If you'll come back
I feel the rain storming after thunder
I can't hold back

Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me

I'll go for miles
Till I find you
You say you want to leave me
But you can't choose
I've gone through pain
Every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane
Something I can't fight

Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me

// I Was There //

Looking back upon my life and the places that I've been
Pictures, faces, girls I've loved, I try to remember when
Faded memories on the wall, some names I have forgotten
But each one is a memory I look back on so often

I look into the past
And I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I look into the past
And I want to make it last
I was there, I was there

Looking back what I have done, there's lots more life to live
At times I feel overwhelmed, I question what I can give
But I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrow

I look into the past
And I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I look into the past
And I want to make it last
I was there, I was there

Looking back upon my life (on my life)
Faded memories on the wall (on the wall)
Looking now at who I am (who am I?)
I don't let it get me down (I don't let it get me down)

Looking back upon my life and the places that I've been
Pictures, faces, girls I've loved, I try to remember when
But I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrow

I look into the past
And I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I look into the past
And I want to make it last
I was there, I was there

// Disappearing Boy //

Now you see me, now you don't
Don't ask me where I'm at
'Cause I'm a million miles away
Treated like a forbidden heel
Don't say my thoughts are not for real
Or you won't see me again

Am I here or am I there
Or am I playing on the stairs
Am I in my room with my toys
I am the disappearing boy

When I walk in crowded rooms
I feel as if it is my doom
I know that I don't belong
In that room I see her
I see her and she's with him
I turn around and then I'm gone

Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
I am the disappearing boy

I have my doubts
Of where I belong
It's something to think about

Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
I am the disappearing boy

// Green Day //

A small cloud has fallen
The white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
Vegging on one detail
The rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red

Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new

Laying in my bed
I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
You're standing so damn close
My body begins to swell
Why does one and one make two?

Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new

Laying in my bed

You're standing so damn close

Why does one and one make two?

Picture sounds

// Going To Pasalacqua //

Here we go again, infatuation
Touches me just when I
Thought that it would end
Oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but
I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking

Well, I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
Well, I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
That's when I say
What the hey!

Would it last forever?
You and I together, hand in hand
We run away (far away)
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can
Give that comes my way, yeah (far away)

// 16 //

Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are all these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead?

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?

Look at my friends and see what they've done
Ask myself why they've had to change
I like them better when they were young
Now all these times are rearranged
I look down and stand there and cry
Nothing ever will be the same
The sun is rising, now I ask why?
The clouds now fall and here comes the rain

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair...? Go!

Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are all these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead?

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?

// Road To Acceptance //

I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I'll never do exactly what I want
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance

I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I'll never do exactly what I want
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance

And I feel forgotten
Feel like rotting
(Do you feel the same?)
(Do you feel the same?)
Adolescence
Just can't make sense
(It's calling my name)
(It's calling my name)

I take a look around
And all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop a while
And maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that
We're all the same

It's just like our brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain

All my life I've seemed to have this need
I think at times it even turns to greed
We all want to join some family
We'll even sacrifice a moral changing

And I feel forgotten
Feel like rotting
(Do you feel the same?)
(Do you feel the same?)
Adolescence
Just can't make sense
(It's calling my name)
(It's calling my name)

I take a look around
And all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop a while
And maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that
We're all the same

It's just like our brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain

I take a look around
And all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop a while
And maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that
We're all the same

It's just like our brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain

// Rest //

Hey, can you hear me?
I'm calling your name
Hello, or is this goodbye?
That gleam in your eye
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again?

So I can rest my head

Angel, (Angel!) dancing away
As all of my thoughts get rearranged
Angel, (Angel!) turning away
Just when things
Seem to have changed

So I can rest my head

Hey, can you hear me?
I'm calling your name
Hello, or is this goodbye?
That gleam in your eye
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again?

So I can rest my head
So I can rest my head

// The Judge's Daughter //

Princess in a school girl's dream
May I please speak with you?
I'm having troubles with control
And it's all because of you
Today I kept on falling down
I thought it was the street
So I look down at my shoes
They were on the wrong feet

And I find it hard to be myself
(Can you please explain?)
And I do not think that it's my health
(You're the one to blame)
You're the one I wish I had
And now my girlfriend is getting mad
(I cannot call this sane...I cannot call this sane)

Today as I was walking down
You bumped into me
You said, "Excuse me," and walked away
As I dropped to my knees
I prayed to the being in the sky
That my parents told me of
I asked about you, but no reply
No clues about your love

And I find it hard to be myself
(Can you please explain?)
And I do not think that it's my health
(You're the one to blame)
My girlfriend left me on the phone
I'm pathetically left here alone
(I cannot call this sane...I cannot call this sane)

Can we find a way
So that you can stay?
I think I'm gonna pop

And I find it hard to be myself
(Can you please explain?)
And I do not think that it's my health
(You're the one to blame)
You're the one I wish I had
And now my girlfriend is getting mad
(I cannot call this sane...I cannot call this sane)

Can we find a way
So that you can stay?
I think I'm gonna pop

// Paper Lanterns //

Now I rest my head from
Such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness
That had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems
As if I'll get some rest
But now and then I'll see you again
And it puts my heart to the test

So, when are all my troubles gonna end?
I'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you

As the days go on I wonder
Will this ever end?
I find it hard to keep control
When you're with your boyfriend
I do not mind if all I am is
Just a friend to you
All I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too

So, when are all my troubles gonna end?
I'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you...yeah

So, when are all my troubles gonna end?
I'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you

// Why Do You Want Him? //

I saw you standing alone
With a sad look on your face
You call him on the phone
Looks like he left without a trace
Tears falling outta your eyes
He's living in a disguise
You've been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it's right or wrong

Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?

Now many days have gone by
You still just sit there and cry
You're feeling bad for yourself
His memory will always dwell
You're so obsessed with his love
That's why push came to shove
You've been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it's right or wrong

Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?

I thought a way out
Throw it all away
Just think about
Yeah, something to say

Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?

// 409 In Your Coffeemaker //

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted
In a daze

It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted
In my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break through these chains
These chains that control
My future's aims, oh no

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted
In a daze

Maybe I'm just too damn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed to think that way
And all of your time gets wasted
In my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break through these chains
These chains that control
My future's aims, oh no

I'm looking
Back now at
Where I have
Have gone wrong
And why I
Could not seem
Could not seem
To get along

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break through these chains
These chains that control
My future's aims, oh no

// Knowledge //

I know things are getting tougher
When you can't get the top off
The bottom of the barrel
Wide open road of my future now
It's looking fucking narrow

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
We get told to decide
Just like as if I'm not going to change my mind

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing...hey!

Whatcha gonna do with yourself
Boy better make up your mind
Whatcha gonna do with yourself boy
You're running out of time

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

And that's fine...yee-ha!

// 1,000 Hours //

Starlit night
The moon is shining bright
You are the one that I need
Up at your window
I see a shadow
Silhouette of your grace
Here's this flower
I picked for all the hours
That you've spent with me
The one I love
That I've been dreaming of
Sailing across the sea

Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer, a kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

Nothing's more
Than what our love is for
As I kiss your cheek
Oh, so softly
Hands flowing down my back
1,000 hours, I'll never leave
Our romance
Is a love trance
And now we'll never part
1,000 hours
Of such a love shower
We'll never stop, once we start

Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer, a kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer, a kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

// Dry Ice //

Late last night I had a dream
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky
Flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she'll dry the tears
Left on my face, I've cried

Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

I'll send a letter to that girl
Asking her to be my own
But my pen is writing wrong
So I'll say it in a song
Oh, I love you more right now
More than I've ever loved before
Here's these words straight from these lips
I'll need you forever more

Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart

Late last night I had a dream
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky
Flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she'll dry the tears
Left on my face, I've cried

Oh I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart

// Only Of You //

I wish I could tell you
But the words would come out wrong
Oh, if you only knew
The way I felt for so long
I know that we're worlds apart
But I just don't seem to care
These feelings in my heart
Only with you I wanna share

The first time I caught
A glimpse of you
Then all my thoughts
Were only of you

I hope that when time goes by
You will think the same about me
Many nights awake I lie
I only wish that you could see
I know that we're only friends
I hope this feeling never ends
If I could only hold you
It's the only thing I wanna do

The first time I caught
A glimpse of you
Then all my thoughts
Were only of you

// The One I Want //

Sitting in my room last night
Staring at the mirror
I couldn't find a reason why
I couldn't be near her

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you'd say, and
Pictures going through my mind
When we're together
All these long and sleepless nights
Will I ever get better?

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you say

'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want

Now you know how I feel
This love is forever
You make my life seem so unreal
Will I ever get better?

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you say

'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want

'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want

// I Want To Be Alone //

I lock myself inside my room
I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wanna be alone
It's been disturbed by my thoughts
I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wanna be alone

Please don't think I'm crazy
I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To hell with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone?
This conflict is my own
Keep yourselves away from me, that's all

I lock myself inside my room
I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wanna be alone
It's been disturbed by my thoughts
I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wanna be alone

Please don't think I'm crazy
I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To hell with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone?
This conflict is my own
Keep yourselves away from me, that's all

I lock myself inside my room
I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wanna be alone
It's been disturbed by my thoughts
I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on
I wanna be alone

Please don't think I'm crazy
I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To hell with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone?
This conflict is my own
Keep yourselves away from me, that's all

I wanna be alone
