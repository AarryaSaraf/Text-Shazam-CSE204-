I got under the grip between this modern hell
I got the rejection letter in the mail and it was already ripped to shreds
Seasons in ruin and this bitter pill is chased in blood
There's fire in my veins and it's pouring out like a flood

Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

This diabolic state is gracing my existence
Like a catastrophic baby, baby, maybe you're the chemical reaction
I am the atom bomb, I am your chosen one
Toxin your reservoir and then return man to ape

Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
