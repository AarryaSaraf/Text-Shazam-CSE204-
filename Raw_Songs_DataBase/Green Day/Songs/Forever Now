My name is Billie and I'm freaking out
I thought therefore I was well I can't really figure it out
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers
Scream out my memories as if I was never there

Standing at the edge of the world
It's giving me the chills
But looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tango, it's freaking me out
Burning lights and blackouts

(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!
(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!

I'm like a punk rocker on Labor Day
How the hell did I work so hard to be born this way?
I never learned to read or write so well (freaking out)
But I can play the guitar until it hurts like hell

Standing at the edge of the world
It's giving me the chills
But looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tango, it's freaking me out
Burning lights and blackouts

(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!
(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!



If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die
If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die

Oh I
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
Don't wanna think about it, oh
It doesn't matter anyway

Oh I
I wanna start a revolution
I wanna hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day

I want a new conspiracy
And the silence of a thousand cries
So hurry up
I want a better way to die



I'm running late to somewhere now that I don't want to be
Where the future and promises ain't what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side ever get so full?

Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere

Oh I
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
Don't wanna think about it, oh
It doesn't matter anyway

Oh I
I wanna start a revolution
I wanna hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day

(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
Oh I
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
Don't wanna think about it, oh
It doesn't matter anyway

(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
Oh I
I wanna start a revolution
I wanna hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day
