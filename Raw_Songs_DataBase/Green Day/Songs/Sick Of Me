Why can't you just admit it? You've had it, you're sick of me
You're fed up with all my bad habits, you're sick of me
To your lies, you've become so desensitized, sick of me
Lost regrets, and you say that you're mad, and feel sick of me

Wandering out the door
I am on to you
You're coming back for more
Am I losing you?

Like a dog that just pissed on your barbecue, sick of me
Losing faith, and you still don't know what to do, sick of me
Loss of health, now you hate everything and you're sick of me
It's a waste, but we still keep on trying, you're sick of me

Wandering out the door
I am on to you
You're coming back for more
Am I losing you?

So you got your problems
So you got it alright
Do you have a conscience?
Do you have a reason?
Now I'm sick of you too

Wandering out the door
I am on to you
You're coming back for more
Am I losing you?
