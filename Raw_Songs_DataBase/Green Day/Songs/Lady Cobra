Well, I met a girl named Lady Cobra
Her black heart beats crimson and clover
She gives me chills and fever blisters
She's serving spells and voodoo shakes

Well, she just wants to get me high (she don't want)
Stick a needle in my eye
Reeks like hell, lost in temptation (she don't need)
Rubbing on my inner demons

I don't wanna suicide
I don't want this to end
I just wanna be your friend

Cuddle up with me real tight
Talk to me by candlelight

Do you wanna play a game of Twister (she don't)
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter?

I don't wanna suicide
I don't want this to end
Well, I just wanna be your friend

Well, I don't want to make you cry (she don't want)
Cross my heart and hope to die
Drawing blood and lonely stars (she don't need)
Drinking piss for cheap guitars

I don't wanna a suicide
I don't want this to end
I just wanna be your friend

Oh, your friend
