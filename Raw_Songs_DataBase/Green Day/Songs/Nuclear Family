Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
Like a ferris wheel that keeps breaking down
Drinking angel's piss, gonna crash and burn
I just want some action, so gimme my turn

Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in hi-fidelity for me too

Can you hear the sound coming over the hill?
Gotta move my feet, it's coming in for the kill
Ba-baby, baby it's a blow out, oh yeah
Like a nuclear bomb and it won't be long 'til I detonate

Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in hi-fidelity for me too

Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
Like a ferris wheel that keeps breaking down
Scream, screaming, screaming bloody murder
Like a nuclear bomb and it won't be long 'til I detonate

Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in hi-fidelity for me too

I say ten! (Whoa-oh) Nine! (Whoa-oh)
Eight! (Whoa-oh) Seven! (Whoa-oh)
Six! (Whoa-oh) Five! (Whoa-oh)
Four! (Whoa-oh) Three! (Whoa-oh)
Five, four, three, two, one!
