Smell your Technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like it's so enlightening
Staring in the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud, and it goes

Wearing a psychotic red alert
Your bouquet of flowers in the dirt
Radioactive and primal, nuclear and so delightful
Wearing Day-Glo where you know it hurts

Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud, and it goes

Smell your Technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like it's so enlightening
Staring in the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud, and it goes
