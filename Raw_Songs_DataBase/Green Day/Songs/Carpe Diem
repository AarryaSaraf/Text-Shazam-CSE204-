Breaking in a sweat like a bomb threat
Is your silhouette fading out?
Nothing left to lose, detonate the fuse
Another breaking news blowout
Ain't it beautiful? So unusual
Life's a gas and it's running out
Living a cliche, gonna seize the day
Bottle rockets that celebrate, celebrate, celebrate

Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Are we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Are we all too young to die?

Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving, alright?

A blink of an eye, barely scraping by
Dominated by passersby
Feeling out of luck when the traffic's stuck
And you're feeling so left behind
Getting off a binge, get a second wind
Another promise to make a change
Got a broken wing, hear the angels sing
When the signal is out of range
Ain't it strange? Ain't it strange?

Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Are we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Are we all too young to die?

Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving, alright?

Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving, alright?

Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Are we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Are we all too young to die?
Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Are we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Are we all too young to die?
