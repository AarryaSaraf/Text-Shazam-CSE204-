How do you get your sleep at night?
How did you get your noose so tight?
Like chewing on tinfoil, it's so much fun
Gonna be dead before you're gone

Just look how things have gotten
And I'll be happy, so I won't pretend
And I'll be cheering that you're going down
And I'll be laughing, I'll be laughing

How many feelings can you steal?
Gotta be part of your appeal
And I can see through you
'Cause you're wearing thin
Like chewing on tinfoil once again

Just look how things have gotten
And I'll be happy, so I won't pretend
And I'll be cheering that you're going down
And I'll be laughing

Haha, you're dead, and I'm so happy
In loving memory of your demise
When your ship is going down
I'll go out and paint the town
Haha, you're dead, haha, you're dead, haha, you're dead

Ha, ha, ha!

Haha, you're dead and I'm so happy
In loving memory of your demise
When your ship is going down
I'll go out and paint the town
Haha, you're dead, haha, you're dead, haha, you're dead
Haha, you're dead, the joke is over
You were an asshole, and now you're gone
As your ship is going down
I'll stand by and watch you drown
Haha, you're dead, haha, you're dead, haha, you're dead

Haha, you're dead, you're gonna be dead
Just remember what I said
Haha, you're dead, haha, you're dead, haha, you're dead
