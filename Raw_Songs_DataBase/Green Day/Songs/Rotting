I'm rotting inside, my flesh turns to dust
Whisper, "Are you dying?" in my ear
I'm so sick to death, tumors in my head
Whisper, "Are you dying?" in my ear

Black rose of death in my fist, I clutch
Thorns shred my fingertips it drips toxic blood

Kiss me one last time, wash off my sweat
Whisper, "Are you dying?" in my ear
As my bones, they rust, read vows of trust
Whisper, "Are you dying?" in my ear

Black rose of death in my fist, I clutch
Thorns shred my fingertips, it drips toxic blood

I'm rotting inside, my flesh turns to dust
Whisper, "Are you dying?" in my ear
Kiss me one last time, wash off my sweat
Whisper, "Are you dying?" in my ear
Whisper, "Are you dying?" in my ear
