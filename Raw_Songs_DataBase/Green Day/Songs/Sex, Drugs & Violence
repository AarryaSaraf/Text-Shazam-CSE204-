All my life, trouble follows me like a mystery girl
I've been chasing round a memory like a mystery girl
I've been getting lost searching my soul all around this town
I took a wrong turn at growing up, and it's freaking me out

Back at school, it never made much sense
And now I pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die, I guess, but that's the way it goes
Sometimes, I must regress to

Sex, drugs, and violence
English, math, and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger

Well, I don't wanna be an imbecile
But Jesus made me that way

All my life I've been running wild like a runaway
Wherever the night takes me, like a stowaway

Back at home, it never made much sense
Now I pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die, I guess, but that's the way it goes
Sometimes, I must regress to

Sex, drugs, and violence
English, math, and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger, hey!

Back at home, it never made much sense
And I can pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die, I guess, but that's the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex, drugs, and violence
English, math, and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger
Sex, drugs, and violence
English, math, and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger
Sex, drugs, and violence
English, math, and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger
