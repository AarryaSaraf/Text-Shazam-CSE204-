Shut your mouth, 'cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a damn anyway
You always seem to be stepping in shit
And all you really do is complain

It's your lie, tell it how you like
Small minds tend to think alike
Shut your mouth, 'cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a fuck anyway

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!

Cut the crap, 'cause you're screaming in my ear
And you're taking up all of the space
You're really testing my patience again
And I'd rather get punched in the face

You're getting on my utter last nerve
Everything you said, I've already heard
I'm sick to death of your every last breath
(Shut the fuck up!)
And I don't give a fuck anyway

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!

Always fuck, fucking with my head now
Always fuck, fucking with my head now
Always fuck, fucking with my head now
Always fucking with my head and I gotta

Let it go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
