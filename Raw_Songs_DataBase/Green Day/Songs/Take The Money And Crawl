High on a low life
Hit me with a dull knife
Sweet soul sickness
Can I get a witness?

This is the wildlife
I'm gonna take a dive
Take the money and crawl
Do I dare say "please"
When I'm on my knees?
Take the money and crawl

Illegal tender
Going on a bender
Cold-blooded killers
Of all motherfuckers

Well, I'm a nervous wreck
Enough to make you sick
Take the money and crawl
Oh yeah, it's just my luck
But I don't give a fuck
Take the money and crawl

This is the wildlife
I'm gonna take a dive
Take the money and crawl
Do I dare say "please"
When I'm on my knees?
Take the money and crawl
So you can take a walk
Or you can suck my cock
Take the money and crawl
Oh yeah, it's just my luck
But I don't give a fuck
Take the money and crawl
