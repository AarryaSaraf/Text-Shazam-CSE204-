There's a trouble in the air
A rumble in the streets
A "going out of business" sale
And a race to bankruptcy
It's not one to ninety-nine, it's ninety-nine to one
A common cause and a call to arms
For the health of our daughters and our sons

It's ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight

There's a rat in the company
A bailout on easy street
How the fuck did the working stiff (Whoa-oh)
Become so obsolete?
Hit the lights and bang the drum
And let your flag unfold
'Cause history will prove itself
In the halls of justice and lost souls

It's ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight

We live in troubled times
From the ghettos to an empty suburban home
We live in troubled times
And I'm ninety-nine percent sure
That something's wrong
It's all wrong!

It's ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight

Nine! Nine! To one! To one!
