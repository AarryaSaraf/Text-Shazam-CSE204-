Her man's been gone
For nigh on a year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here

Her man's been gone
For nigh on a year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here



Down your street your crying is a well-known sound
Your street is very well-known throughout your town
Your town is very famous for a little girl
Whose crying can be heard all around the world



We have a remedy
You'll appreciate
Don't need to be so sad
He's only late

We'll bring you flowers and things
That'll pass your time
We'll give him eagle's wings
So he can fly to you

Fa la la la la la

Fa la la la la la

We have a remedy
Fa la la la la la la

We have a remedy

Little girl, stop your crying (Stop your crying...)
Ivor the Engine Driver's gonna make you feel alright



My name is Ivor
I'm an engine driver

I know him well
I know why you feel blue
Just 'cause he's late
Don't mean he'll never get through

He told me he loved you
He ain't no liar, I ain't either
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver



We'll soon be home
Soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

We'll soon be home
Soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

We'll soon be home
We'll soon be home



Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang

Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello

I don't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?

It's like a dream to be with you again
It's like a dream to be with you again

I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the engine driver's lap
Laid with him, and had a nap

You are forgiven, you are forgiven 

You are all forgiven
