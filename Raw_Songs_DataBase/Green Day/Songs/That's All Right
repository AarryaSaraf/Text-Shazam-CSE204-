Well that's all right, mama
If that's all right with you
Well that's all right, mama
Just stand the way you do
Well that's all right

That's all right
Now Mama, any way you do

Well mama she done told me
Papa then told me too
Son that girl you foolin' with she ain't no good for you
That's all right
That's all right
That's all right
Now mama, anyway you do

1, 2
1, 2, 3, 4!

Stop when the red lights flash, baby!
