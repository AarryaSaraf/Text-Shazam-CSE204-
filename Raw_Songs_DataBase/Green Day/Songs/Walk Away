This time
I've gotta put my guard down
And pick myself up off the ground
And take the pain
It'll pass
The swelling never really lasts
But the scar remains remind me
That I'm still living

Well, it's not too late
Oh, it's really not worth the fight
No one's right
Well, it's time to walk away

Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Well, the bigger that you come
All the harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away

Did you win?
Or maybe did you lose?
Now you're gonna lick your wounds anyway
It goes back to you
When you fall
You're gonna need a parachute
Or a used pair of shoes to go
And walk away

Well, it's not too late
Oh, it's really not worth the fight
No one's right
Well, it's time to walk away

Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Well, the bigger that you come
All the harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away

Walk away
Ay, ay-ay-ay, ay, walk away
Ay, ay-ay-ay, ay, walk away

Well, the bigger that you come
All the harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away

Walk away
Walk away
