Every time I'm falling down
You take the repercussions
Headaches and anxiety
Advancing my frustrations

Rush into my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well, now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me, stuck with me

Oh, hang up your soul to my wrists
And I'll vow my trust to you
Moving here, I always said
Now I realize you've imagined

Rush into my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well, now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me, stuck with me

Rush into my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well, now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me, stuck with me
