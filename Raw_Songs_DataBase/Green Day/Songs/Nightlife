Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife


What's that I hear? You want to go for a ride?
Oh, don't be afraid, boy, to come inside
I got that thing that you want, the fix that you need
And have this with a little lust and greed
I'll be the devil on your shoulder saying, "Hey, boy, come over"
For my black heart beats crimson and clover
So operator, operator, patch my boy in
This is nightlife, and I'll get under your skin


Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife


Short of breath, heartbeat fast
Sounds like love but you know it won't last
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route
Red velvet halls line these sugar-coated walls
Girls hang on bar stools for late last calls
This town is full of snakes, mistakes, and whiskey shakes
It's too late, I already cut the brakes


Well, I am rolling, strolling into town (Come inside)
Is it me, or am I going crazy? (It's just you)
This dirty city is my sugar town (Sugar town)
My little angel of death is my nightlife


Come inside
It's just you
Sugar town

Gonna make a move before I get bored
If you wanna explore my vocal chord
Baby girl coco dancing the cooch
One hand on my knee, one hand on the hooch
Why don't you stick around for one more round?
This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown
'Cause I'm a ringleader, I run the show
And only when I tell ya it will be time to go


Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife


(Hey, boy) She is my nightlife
(Hey, boy) She is my nightlife
(Hey, boy) She is my nightlife
(See you later) She is my nightlife
