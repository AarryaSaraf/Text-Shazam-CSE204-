Say "hello" from your window
Say "goodbye" from your car
Say "goodnight" from your pillow
Say "so long" from the stars

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Take a walk out of my life
Sing to me a lullaby
Cradle songs for a mid-life
Don't forget to pass me by

As my imagination runs away
On this 8th Avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the whispering wall
Before all the flames burn out

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

As my imagination runs away
On this 8th Avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the whispering wall
Before all the flames burn out

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
