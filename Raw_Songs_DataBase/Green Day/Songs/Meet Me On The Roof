I'm crawling on the dance floor (Dance floor)
I think I lost my phone
Feeling like a toothache (Toothache)
My face is going numb
I beg a thousand pardons
All my friends are crazy
Hanging from the window (Window)
And all you gotta do is jump

Come meet me on the roof tonight girl
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?

I'm hanging with the cholos (Cholo)
Cruising down the strip
Sleeping with a pillow (Don't wake me up don't wake me up)
Waking up in spit
I'm taking drowning lessons
Secret words and true
Confessionals (Confessionals)
And the worst is yet to come

Come meet me on the roof tonight girl
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?

So meet me where the good times go, ooh
How high is your low? As far as I can go

Come meet me on the roof tonight girl
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?
