Lights out
Here comes the night
As the darkness falls over the light
Lights out
There goes the day
And this fear that comes won't go away

And I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide (Lights out!)

Lights out
I lost myself
In the space between heaven and hell
Lights out
Finding my way
Did I waste my time losing the way?

And I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide (Lights out!)

Lights out!

Lights out
Here comes the night
As the darkness falls over the light
Lights out
I lost myself
In the space between heaven and hell

And I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide (Lights out!)
