Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I do
I got a sentimental illness for you
Please don't go away, oh yeah

I was a high school atom bomb
Going off on the weekends
Smoking dope and mowing lawns
And I hated all the new trends
Me and my friends sang
"Woah-uh-oh-oh-oh (woah-uh-oh)
Here's to the middle of the road
At least it's better than here"

Looking for a buzz
But all I got was Santa Claus
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high, too scared to dream
But too dumb to die

My daddy always was on strike
Going off with the teamsters
He said that everything will be alright
Not every Sunday can be Easter
The picket line screamed
"Woah-uh-oh-oh-oh (woah-uh-oh)
Don't cross, don't cross the line
Because you'll be a scab, not a martyr"

Looking for a cause
But all I got was Camouflage
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high, too scared to dream
But too dumb to... (haha, yeah, hey!)

Looking for a cause
