She, she's my wild one (Wild one)
My heart is in panic, her eyes look so manic, now
She, little wild one (Wild one)
My heart is a chaser, she's strung out on razors, now

She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinkin' the Kool-Aid, I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow, hello

She, she's my wild one (Wild one)
My heart is in danger, from shadows and strangers, now
She, little wild one (Wild one)
She's covered in angels and demons and halos, now

She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinkin' the Kool-Aid, I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow, hello

Wild one
Wild one

She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All fucked up with nowhere to go
I'm drinkin' the Kool-Aid, I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow, hello

Little wild one (Wild one)
My heart is in danger, she's strung out on razors now
My heart is in danger, she's strung out on razors now
