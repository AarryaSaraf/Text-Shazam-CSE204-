I been working on my body
You ever seen a nigga hit Pilates?
No, I ain't feeling sorry
Been in the kitchen bumping NASARATI
Shit
I been in the crib going crazy
I been movin' work on the daily
Baby, I ain't tryna be your baby
Understand I'm just tryna be the daily

Scoop, scoop, skrrt
Scoop, scoop, skrrt
Scoop, scoop, skrrt
Scoop, scoop, skrrt

Blue stones at the kickback
They lookin' at my wrist, now watch it hit back
My ex hittin' my phone tryna get back
Don't you hit me with that, "Miss you," I ain't with that

Now it's, he get flown and he sit back
And I won't call on the phone if I hit that
And I'm tryna fuck, little nigga, fuck the chitchat
Ain't talkin' guns when I ask where your dick at

I been working on my body
You ever seen a nigga hit Pilates?
No, I ain't feeling sorry
Been in the kitchen bumping NASARATI
Shit
I been in the crib going crazy
I been movin' work on the daily
Baby, I ain't tryna be your baby
Understand I'm just tryna be the daily

Scoop, scoop, skrrt
Scoop, scoop, skrrt
Scoop, scoop, skrrt
Scoop, scoop, skrrt

Tomorrow is my day off (Okay)
All them rehearsals got me tight, look at the payoff (Okay)
And now my body look like something you'd eat cake off
I just got my veneers out, bitches wanna get they face up
But you thought you'd have a chance after you wanna disrespect me
Let him apologize, I need it in a Bentley
He named my right cheek Jennifer and left one, Lopez
Can't call me stupid with this big ol' fucking forehead, motherfucka'
Let me-

Scoop, scoop, skrrt (Okay)
Scoop, scoop, skrrt (Okay)
Scoop, scoop, skrrt
Scoop, scoop, skrrt

I don't wanna lie-ie-ie
I really only need you for the night
No, I don't wanna lie-ie-ie
I really only need you for the night
Can I-

Scoop, scoop, skrrt
Scoop, scoop, skrrt
Scoop, scoop, skrrt
Scoop, scoop

Shit
I been working on my body (Yeah)
Working overtime to make sure I'll be the scoop
They gon' know me, scoop
Roy baby
(Daytrip took it to 10, hey)
