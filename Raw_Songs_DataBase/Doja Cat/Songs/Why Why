Baby, when I go wild like that
When I ain't shy like that
Steppin' out and look fly like that
He ain't touchin' on it
Make him wanna go cry like that
When I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"
And I know you hate it when I tease you, baby
See when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"
Lemme hear you tellin' me, "I need you, baby"
See, when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"

Hit me when you're frustrated (boy)
You ain't picky and get ignorant 'round all my ladies
I could come fix you, but you broke-headed
You want Whitney, you want Britney, Jennifer and Halle
(Baby)
They ain't cold like me
Put them bitches in my old winter coat
That is so last week (week)
Them other niggas, they been waitin' for it
They gon' hold my seat
Kryptonite when I'm throwin' ass, 'cause I know your weakness
I can't forget how it used to be
In your thoughts, livin' good with me
And it feel so right, when I make you scream, "Please"

Baby, when I go wild like that
When I ain't shy like that
Steppin' out and look fly like that
He ain't touchin' on it
Make him wanna go cry like that
When I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"
And I know you hate it when I tease you, baby
See when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"
Lemme hear you tellin' me, "I need you, baby"
See, when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"


I know I'm not your type like that
But I'm gon' still try
Her pretty face, ass fat, waist snatched
It ain't got no size
Her Kelly crocodile fifty stacks (Yeah)
You don't even know why, you don't know why
But it's all on me (It's all on me)
Make you smile just to help you show your all-white teeth (Your all-white teeth)
Bust down with a purple dial, this a flawless AP (Flawless AP)
She said, "You can have any girl around this town, why me?" (Why, why me?)
'Cause I can see loyalty and ambition and style like me
Arch her back into position, I'ma tryna dig deep (Tryna dig deep)
I gave her some racks towards her business, she don't need a degree (She don't need a degree)
We flew a genie-nie-nie to the Philippines, our backyard a sea
She make Wunna ease, we infinity, I don't never wanna leave


Baby, when I go wild like that
When I ain't shy like that
Steppin' out and look fly like that
He ain't touchin' on it
Make him wanna go cry like that
When I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"
And I know you hate it when I tease you, baby
See when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"
Lemme hear you tellin' me, "I need you, baby"
See when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"
When I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"
See, when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"
