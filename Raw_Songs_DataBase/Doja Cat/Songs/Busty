Jeans just ripped, buttons poppin' off my blouse, uh
Poppin' off my blouse, poppin' off my blouse
Jeans just ripped, buttons poppin' off my blouse (Yeah)

She just got some money
She just got her tummy tuck
Look mom a money flood (Look mommy)
Only thing that's ugly is them hoes who talk funny
I ain't really said nothing, I just show em how it's doney
Mix my whip cream, and caramel, with that syrup and that honey
Yeah that big thing go slam
Said this bitch need no hands
Got him licking on his lips, I'm lookin' like hickory smoke ham
With my thick thighs and no tummy
Shake that maker of that money, huh

Must be genes, man, I'm lucky
Collard greens, yams, I'm yummy
If I see ya man I'm bussing, bussing, bussing
'Cause I'm brrr, uh, busty, busty, busty

Hey, I can't take my dress off 'cause my titties still big, uh
She just wanna scissor
Tongue out like a lizard
I just made that nigga disappear, I'm like a wizard
I just got my hair done, I'm feeling like SZA
I ain't won the lotto, I am just a winner
If she is a snack, then I'm a candle-lit dinner
Think I got him shooken, watch him fidget like a spinner
I been getting thinner and thinner and thicker

I'm, I'm, I'm brrr, uh, busty
Must be genes, man, I'm lucky
Collard greens, yams, I'm yummy
If I see ya man I'm bussing, bussing, bussing
'Cause I'm brrr, uh busty, busty, busty

Poppin' off, poppin' off my blouse
Poppin' off my blouse
