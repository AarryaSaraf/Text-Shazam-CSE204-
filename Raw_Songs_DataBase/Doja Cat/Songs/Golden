How the fuck you live so golden?
How you make your mouth and your wrist all frozen?
No handlebars but my hits so Hogan
Pockets make the thou when I'm feeling so bloated
Click, bang, pow, now your speakers are loaded
New JCs, I can't wait to put my toes in
Posin' and all them little niggas start jonesin'
We might have something in common 'cause I admit I'm focused
I've been riding through The Hills like Heidi
Twerkin' on his suit like Miley
He chasin' like Coyote, Wile E
So I ain't surprised if his bitch tryna bite me, hold up
