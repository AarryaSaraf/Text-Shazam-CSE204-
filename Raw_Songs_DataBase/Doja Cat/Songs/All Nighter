Let me break it to you, boy, I, I, I, I
I can give it to you all night
All in all, we pullin' all-nighters
We ain't gotta turn on them lights

Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, yea-uh, finna be up, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh

Yuh, we up 'til the day break off
Make up when I take, take off
No sleep, you my sunshine, though
Just me, you, and some wine, look
'Cause we tryna unwind, look
We sleep baby, sometimes, look
Yeah, we got the same schedule, sexual drive
Speed through, I just led you
Spent 15 on it and that's fine
'Cause we already been around five
Lil' weed, Hennessy, kinda sound nice
Finna need new sheets by around nine
Feelin' weak in the knees
Make it bounce like blap-blap-blap
Bed smack to the wall tap-tap-tap
Wait, let me throw it all back-back-back
Neighbor bangin' on the door

Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies, okay, yeah

Let me break it to you, boy, I, I, I, I
I can give it to you all night
All in all, we pullin' all nighters
We ain't gotta turn on them lights

Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, yea-uh, finna be up, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh

Baby I just clocked out
In the middle of the night, need a snack, oh
Ain't tryna knock out
Still workin' on my wine, need a back rub
Wish we could rewind to the bathtub
First night, wreckin' this suite, no pack up
Tuck me like money in a mattress
But we ain't finna sleep on a mattress
Practice, knee-deep in your tactic
Back it up, beep beep, no U-Haul
Tossed salad, no cheese, no croutons
Said it don't taste cheap, no coupon
No drugs, just me's that you's on
Five star, that's sweet, no futon
Dem a' other girl tired, huge yawn
I ain't talkin' 'bout the tea when I oolong

Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies, okay, yeah

Let me break it to you, boy, I, I, I, I
I can give it to you all night
All in all, we pullin' all-nighters
We ain't gotta turn on them lights

Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, yea-uh, finna be up, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
