I got a message
Can you guess what it said?
Drive alone
Drive straight home

I did as instructed
Closed my door and locked it
Disappearing ink
But the words still sting

Sat and wrote a letter
I described the weather
And the scene
Remembering

I forget tomorrow
All sickness and sorrow
Disappearing ink
But the words still sting

What was I thinking?
What was I thinking?
