Your cage is what you make it
If you decorate it
It goes back faster
Goes quick, laughter
Permeates the carnage
Laying out in sunlight
At daybreak, oh
Daybreak, oh
Oh

You look cute in plastic
My existence drastic
And lake of flowers
Burning flowers
Try to make it faster
Crayons in the laughter
A screen of gel
Patient hell

Call it what you want, dear
I call it fear
And I am an expert
Laying out brick by brick
Call it what you need to
I left behind reason
Faith I take, I, faith I take, I
