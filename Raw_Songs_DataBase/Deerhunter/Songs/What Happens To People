What happens to people?
Their lives up in arms
What happens to people?
They quit holding on
What happens to people
And what can they do?
They're only returning
The powers of youth
What happens to people?
What happened to you?
What happens to people?
They fade out of view

I can't remember
Your face
It's lost to me
It's lost to me
Now it's ending
The wounds remain
On the page
On the page

What happens to people?
They quit holding on
What happens to people?
Their dreams turn to dark
The rust in your castle
You're trying to fill

Old lady
Let me into your rotting house
Your rotting house
Old man
Take a step back
And figure it out, out
Figure it out

Old lady
Cover your branches
Winter is coming
Beware
Old man
Oil your engine
You're rusting out
You're rusting out

What happens to people?
They quit holding on
And they're locked out
They get locked out
Locked out
They get locked out
Locked out
They get locked out
