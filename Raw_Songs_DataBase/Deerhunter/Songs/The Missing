Open up my thoughts
tell me if you see
some meaning.
Take me all apart.
So that I can see
the pieces.

And I could walk for miles.
And on every street
is the same scene.
Follow the telephone wires
until I feel this air beneath me.

Oh and if you don't mind,
would you show to me
the missing?
With my weak eyes
I would only see
the missing.

Open up my thoughts
Tell me if you see some meaning.
Take me all apart,
So that I can see the bleeding.

Oh if you don't mind,
could you show to me
the missing?
With my weak eyes
I would only see
the missing.
The missing.
The missing.
The missing.
The missing.
The missing.

And I would understand
(I could understand)
if you show to me
the missing.

And I could understand
(I could understand)
if you showed to me
the missing.

And I would understand
(I could understand)
if you show to me
the missing.
