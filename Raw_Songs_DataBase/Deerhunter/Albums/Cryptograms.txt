Album: Cryptograms

// Cryptograms //

My greatest fear I fantasized
The days were long, the weeks flew by
Before I knew I was awake
My days were through, it was too late

My greatest fear I organized
Into something more realized
And now what's left I get to spend
Knowing that it's about to end

My greatest fear I can't decode
A cryptogram whose seeds weren't sewn
My last few months I arised out
My vision blurred, there was no sound

There was no sound, there was no sound

// Lake Somerset //

It pays to kill anyone who has information
In the park we hide behind rocks
We urinate on rocks until the sun comes up

Encrypted in flesh, concrete soaked in sweat
We lived in Lake Somerset
It was south of Dallas Highway, just east of a drained lake

Orchids dissolve, equations solved, psychic landscape
To know there is a limit to what you can experience
These walls I know, I grew up here

No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction

// Octet //

I was the corpse that spiraled out

I was the corpse that spiraled out
Into phantom hallways

I was the corpse that spiraled out

// Spring Hall Convert //

So I woke up in a radio freeze
Occupied by a
Couple of girls I knew from
Way back when where

Oh, I had my face like the ocean
So I'd radiate but
Too much radiation
I walk around like a walker

Always choosing where to go
And where to be
Oh, radiation
Oh, radiation

Oh, so long
Oh, so long, so long

So long loneliness, so long loneliness
So long loneliness, so long, so long

So long, yeah, so long, yeah
So long, yeah, so long

So far from home, so far from home
So far from home, so far from home

// Strange Lights //

What direction should we choose?
We're lost and still confused
I walk into the sun
With you, the only one

Who understood the ways
The hours become days
The weeks turn into months
We walk into the sun

So glad to have a guide
Less lonely for the ride
And should this car ascend
At least I'm with a friend

In space all things are slow
No sound with speakers blown
The silence fits the scene
The prince is now the king

We walk into the sun
We walk but cannot run
Because walking's half the fun
We walk into the sun

And neon blurs my sight
I'm guided by strange lights
And I'm rattled and I'm stunned
As I walk into the sun

// Hazel St. //

There was no connecting my actions with words
In the bright sunlight the movement of birds
The car ride home was blinded again
The light would not focus, the light would not bend

There's no use calling, I know what you'd say
Over and over, it ended today
Words lost their meaning and could not explain
Why the subject was always just out of frame

I was sixteen
I lived on Hazel Street
Protect me from the scene
And guide me with your heat

I was sixteen
I lived on Hazel Street
Protect me from the scene
And guide me with your heat

Ice forms in sheets
They're melting in the street
The ice forms in sheets
They're melting in the street

// Heatherwood //

In the beginning the world was a map
Out through the back door and into the trap
Home is an echo reflecting a place
I disappeared then and without a trace

I was arranged to leave on that day
There were complications, I've chosen to stay
I saw the curtains and it was the end
When one life is over a new one begins
When one life is over a new one begins
When one life is over a new one begins

Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again

Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again

Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again

Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again, was not seen again
Was not seen again
