// Young Girls //

I spent all my money, bought a big old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honies
Oh, yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long

All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like "Everything will be okay"
Oh, I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist
When you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long

All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

You, you, you,
You, you, you
Yeah, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

// Gorilla //

Ooh I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down

You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

Look what you're doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
'Cause what I got for you
I promise it's a killer,
You'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas

Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You just smile and tell me, "Daddy, it's yours."
'Cause you know how I like it,
You's a dirty little lover

If the neighbors call the cops,
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT ‒ we don't stop,
We keep rocking while they're knocking on our door
And you're screaming, "Give it to me baby,
[Clean version:] Give it like you wanna!"
[Explicit version:] Give it to me motherfucker!"

Oh, look what you're doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run

I promise it's a killer,
You'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah

// Moonshine //

Hello
You know you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips you know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free
Oh

Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

I know, I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they know that I'm not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world, is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright

Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, oh

Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Don't look down, don't you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, oh

Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

// When I Was Your Man //

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, ohh…
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

// Natalie //

Oh, I never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Wrong turn on a dusty road
I did it to myself, I can't pretend
Well, I learned just a little too late
Good God, I must've been blind
'Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright

Like my daddy I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little Miss Snake eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her doors
'Cause once I get my hands on her, Imma oh

Natalie
She ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie
She's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch
For this gold-digging bitch
Watch out
She's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named
Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run

The good lord better bless your soul
'Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, please, please, please
And now I look at you and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night

I spend a lifetime in jail (yeah, that's what I'll do)
I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah, thinking bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
So there ain't no use in trying
Once I get my hands on you, Imma oh

Natalie
She ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie
She's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch
For this gold-digging bitch
Watch out
She's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named
Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run

I should've known better (I should've known better)
'cause when we were together ('cause when we were together)
She never said forever (she never said forever)
I'm a fool that played in her game, hey

Natalie
She ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie
She's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch
For this gold-digging bitch
Watch out
She's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named
Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run

// If I Knew //

Oh, oh, oh I, I was a city boy
Riding to danger's where I'd always run
A boy who had his fun

But I wouldn't've done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come

Now baby, now baby, now baby, now baby

Oh, oh, oh, I, I know it breaks your heart
To picture the only one you wanna love
In someone else's arms

But I wouldn't've done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come

Now, baby, now, baby, now, baby

Oh, baby, please
Let's leave the past behind us, behind us
So that we can go where love will find us
Yeah, will find us

I know most girls would leave me
But I know that you believe me

Baby, I, I wish we were seventeen
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me

No, I wouldn't've done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you'd come
If I knew one day you'd come

// Old & Crazy //

Will you still call me baby when I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby when I'm old and crazy?

Will you still hold my hand when my clothes are out of style?
My teeth all ran away and I don't have the same smile

Will you still call me baby when I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby when I'm old and crazy?

Will you still wanna dance even if my hips are weak?
My ears don't hear so well and I can't find the beat

Will you still call me baby when I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
