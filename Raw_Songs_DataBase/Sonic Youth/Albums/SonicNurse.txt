// Pattern Recognition //

I'm a cool hunter making you my way

Like a brand name you'll replay 


I will know you 

I won't show you, yeah yeah 

You're the one [x4] 


Heat-seeking missile freak 

Black magick 

Scared to speak 

I will know you 

I won't show you, yeah yeah 

Will you buy me a shaky heart 

Let's forget has torn me apart 


I will know you 

I won't show you, yeah yeah 

You're the one [x4] 


Can you sell me 

Yesterday's girl 

Cuz everyday I feel more like her 

Oh baby baby 

Please don't go 


Pattern recognition 

Is kind of slow 

Like a cool hunter watch the disarray 

Keep your secret foolish head away 

I will know you 

I won't show you, yeah yeah 

Close your eyes and feel the fun 

Pattern recognition's on the run 


I will know you 

I won't show you, yeah yeah yeah 

You're the one [x4]

// Unmade Bed //

[Thurston]

Look who's come back home again

Loser looking for his lucky break

This time he says he just needs a friend

Ain't on the run he ain't on the take


Can you unlock this door babe

Will you just undo the chain

Will you take yr time before you

Mix up love, his love and pain


Loneliness lays down his head

Wants to get you high, better take it now

A man like that's like an unmade bed

Stained eyes searching for another way out


Do you really even want this

Maybe you just don't care

All I know it takes just one kiss, babe

For you - he's never there


Hey I know it's kinda hard

And maybe this time it will never end

Hit and run lover back in yr heart

All those answered prayers that you never have sent


Cuz now that yr in his arms babe

You know yr just in his way 

Suckered by his fatal charm, oh girl

It's time we get away

// Dripping Dream //

Single fold sick insert design in junk

Grocery bag sleeve all the colours drunk

Texts of confusion and joy

Pink plastic pressing for bratfink

That's right

he's gone

wrapped up

chiffon

Sealed tight

hung up

street mouth

sad pup

Shards of sweetshine of voice and flute

Street mouth decodes the bluesking dude

Girlfriends will love the way we clip

Our split release on the thrashman

On top

a drop

fake blood

fresh mud

They're gone

for good

except

this one

Howling scriptures to the mother earth

O mother Africa awake yr son

To all the mommas with the money eyes

This kind of love comes as no surprise

Caught shadow

in sex meadow

Little darlings describe the scene

Purring notions of the dripping dream

We've been searching for the cream dream wax

Lathe killers make the meters crack

Caught shadow

in sex meadow

Purring notions of the dripping dream

The kinda girls with the money eyes

Howling scriptures to the mother earth

O mother Africa awake yr sun

Caught shadow

in sex meadow

Little darlings describe the scene

To all the mommas with the money eyes

Purring notions of the dripping dream

This kinda love comes in any size

Sensation shaking us from sleep

Hey Ethiopia were free

The dripping dream in cream-o-wax

Disk drops from yr hand and it cracks

// Kim Gordon And The Arthur Doyle Hand Cream //

[Kim]

Yr bounce to the ounce makes us wanna pounce

Yr just being totally perfect

On Larry King you said you were tired

Time to put to bed yr competitive edge

They say you can't say no to Brahma

Now you don't have to try so hard

The label says you don't have to wear less clothes

It's time to take a bubble bath

[Chorus:]

Hey hey little baby breakdown

Button up baby you come undone

Hey hey little baby get down

Before you fall and hurt someone


You say you need privacy

Broken glass everywhere

Maybe you need an emo boy

No underwear on the director's chair

You are seemingly unconscious 

Of what yr body is doing

Like Miss Monroe yr head don't know

Exactly what yr body's doing

[Chorus]


On TV you're soft and whispery 

Delicate like angel food cake

They say if you press too hard on it

It will squish into a dense ball 

It will lose its fluffiness

That's what you get when you use a box mix

Can you get some satisfaction

How much are you willing to pay?

[Chorus]


What's yr gut feeling about the new deal

How's the label gonna remake you?

How was yr date with Eminem

Did he bake you and then forsake you

Is innocence gonna still overtake you

Like Arthur Doyle they can't fake you

Oh Mariah you are endless

Like the wind, you feel defenseless

[Chorus]

// Stones //

Lights on the stones on backed-up drain 

What lovers list on languid stain 

We've come together to gather star 

Shooting up stones a pallored heart 


Dead or alive 

There's danger 

The dead are alright 

With me 


We're not gonna run away 

We're not gonna leave you stranger 

We turn the light on your lonely home 


Camera on the haunted stones 

Blood-shadow gentle painted scorn 

Now it's dancin' ink across your skin 

Hieroglyphic-lover nature-friend 


The dead are alive 

There's danger 

The dead are alright 

With me 


We're not gonna run away 

We're not gonna leave you stranger 

We turn the light on your lonely home

// Dude Ranch Nurse //

Keep on runnin' in the dark 

Dude ranch dream is fallin' apart 

Stolen kisses let's pretend my friend 

You play sick and I will mend 

Let the action begin again my friend 

You be patient and I'll attend 


Let's rehearse let's do it again 

Dude ranch nurse yr brand new friend 


Let nurse give you a shot it's something to do 

Took my pulse 

Let nurse give you a shot it's something to do 

I could love you I could love you 


Deep sleep coming along 

Like a newborn colt you found 

You're wrapping around the gauze 

Dizzy reminder 

Ouch she found 


Let nurse give you a shot, don't slip too far 

I could love you 

I could have you 


You be cowboy and I'll allow 

Let me ride you 'til you fall 

Let's pretend there's nothing at all 

Nobody knows the shape I'm in 

Kiss me now it's just a sin 

Nobody knows the shape I'm in

// New Hampshire //

Trace paper flying word

Trace paper flying word break

City skoot hi

City skoot hi alert

Kill us your skum fight blooze

Kill us yourr skum fight blooze blues

Johnny winter

Johnny winter no show


B.B. King just turns on

The New Hampshire boys

Steve and Joe

Have gone beyond

Doing it for life


Unlike buddy guy who has

Decimated the riff bat with one

Hypertonic

Note lead on

Lead on

// Paper Cup Exit //

Skimmin' the tops of tall trees 

Through the clear light of free speech 

A sudden memory disease 

Claims the air all around me 


I'm gettin' lost in the slipstream 

Maybe relive the same dream 

Of comin' in from the cold 

And losin' half of my soul 


Memory disease 

Across United States 


That I had told the truth 

Feel so high 

Architectural 

I look to the skies 

To see our bodies 

They were rising up 

Out of the paper cup 


A sea change is due 

I don't seem to (?) you 

Touchdown on the new mason-dixon 

Line-up map was ripped and torn 

Jilted frame with all hope gone 

And I don't mind if you sing a differnet song 

Sing a different song 

Just as long as you sing 

Sing along 


It's later than it seems [x3]

Time everyone came down (?) 

It's what you didn't say it's what you didn't say 

Don't wanna be a slave 

It's what you didn't


Skimmin' the tops of tall trees 

Through the clear light of free speech 

I'm comin' in for a landing 

I've got a soul (sole?) understanding 

It all comes down to a word 

It's just like nothin' I heard 

Over the rainbow in time 

Will be one hell of a climb 

Eye lights bright 

The lights sweep high clear sky 

Sky 

Reminiscent 

Of money in your eye 

Unwind 


I don't mind if you sing a different song 

Sing a different song 

Just as long as you sing 

Sing along 

It's later than it seems 

It's later than it seems 

It's later than it seems 


New ears are listening 

It's what you didn't say 

It's what you didn't say 

Don't wanna be a slave 

It's what you didn't say 

Nothing to give away

// I Love You Golden Blue //

Dead boy stares 

Strange to meet you 

Dead boy cares 

So great to see you 


Is it time to go 

It's a place I know 

I can't read your mind 

I can't find the time 

I can't feel the thrill 

I don't have the will 


Dead boy dares 

Believe in you 

Dead boy stares 

Afraid that you will see him 


Is it time to go 

Is it a place I know 

I can't read your mind 

I can't find the time 

I can't feel the thrill 

I don't have the will 


I love you 

A metallic blue 

I love you 

Golden blue 

I miss you 

Shine all alone 

I miss you 


Don't know what to do 

I don't glitter like the stars above 

I don't glow like neon alone 

Don't blush it's just the wind outside 

Don't rush to be by my side
