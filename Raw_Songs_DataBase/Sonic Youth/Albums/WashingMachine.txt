Album: WashingMachine

// Becuz //

Wish I could change the way that you feel
Standing with him you feel more real
Looking so sweet with all your might
Trustin' in him to fully ignite

Holding his hand like a brand new kite
Blue eyes sparkle, open, alright
Wish I could see, the girl who'd fight
Playing and laughing and trying to show it

Running and falling and dying to know it
Staring you down with her gaze hold it
Wish I could free you but I can't don't blow it

Angel, gonna show it
Lord
The devil, go on hold it
Angel, gonna show it
Lord
Blow it

Becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you
Becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you
Becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you
Becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you

Wish I could free you, but I can't, don't blow it
Wish I could free you, but I can't, don't know it

// Junkie's Promise //

A hundred dollars used to be more than enough
And now a hundred times a day and still it's not enough
People always tell me you get what you deserve
All I know is all and all is all I've heard

I heard you say: "you know I hate myself
But I love everybody else"
And did you say: "I can't escape myself"
And then you did and now there's no one else

To blame you know that I know yeah that times are rough
I'd like to help you out but things are rather tough
People always tell me that you've got to lend a helping hand
Nothing in return is all I expect from you my friend

I heard you say: "you know I hate myself
But I love everybody else"
And did you say: "I can't escape myself"
And then you did and now there's no one else

I heard you say: "you know I hate myself
But I love everybody else"
And did you say: "I can't escape myself"
And then you do and now there's no one else

// Saucer-Like //

Swirling whirling through the city of ages
You sink a bit whenever angels fly
Do you have a feeling for their fuzzy faces?
Are you close enough to see into their eyes?

You're magic fit and free
Taxi holds on the breeze
A dream's a dream of feelings
That never fall at all
Holds his thoughts in chains
And tries to bust up the walls

Every day it's just another breath
Every night another little death
Do you scratch and itch when your head feels tight
Or wave it away and just stay out all night?

Got your head in the trees
If that's the way you're feeling
It's not good or bad
Channels of thought revealing now
Some things we all had

I'm having a wonderful vision of the city today
Buildings all lined up neat on straight sun lit blocks
Avenue canyons stretch forever
Handcut panes grooved like a record
Flat bridge
Peer, boat, docks
I'm slipping round the bottom edge [line echoes]

Do you trip and breeze
Down city streets
Just a little free
With your head in the trees

// Washing Machine //

Yeah, I take my baby down to the street and I buy him a soda-pop
He's so sweet

Alright now, alright now, alright now
You said that

If you want I'll be the one
Take you out and have some fun
I never never ever ever tell no one
Till the end, till the morning comes

Yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and
I buy him a soda-pop
Hmm hmm

Alright now, alright now, alright now

If you want I'll be the one
Take you out and have some fun
Flip a quarter for the toss
I'd like mine with apple-sauce

Yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and
I buy him a soda-pop
'Cause he's so neat, sweet

Alright now, alright now, alright now
Okay now

If you want I'll be the one
Shake my legs and have some fun
My hearts spinnin' round like a washing machine
Never saw the devil look so damn clean

Yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and
I buy him a soda-pop
And he said: "honey, you look so fine"
And I said: okay, alright, okay, alright

I was walking up Lafayette street
It's real empty
And I looked out and it turned into a big field
And I looked up in the sky
And I looked up in the clouds
And I saw this face looking down at me
And it's a women's face
And she threw a quarter down at me and she said:
"Honey, here's a quarter go put it in the washing machine"
And then I looked up at her,
I looked up

// Unwind //

Lay down your lucky hand, upon her heart
Morning becomes a kite, tangled up in stars
Laugh in the midday light, and leave - it behind
Move out into his sundry eyes, and sing, unwind

Hang down your lucky head, a sign to time
Morning becomes the sun, for the dandy line
Sooner than the midday light, we leave behind
Love is out into the sundry light, you sing, unwind
