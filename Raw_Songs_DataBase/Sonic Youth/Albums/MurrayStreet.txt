// The Empty Page //

These are the words but not the truth

God bless them all when they speak to you

But that's alright

On an empty stage

Sing out when

There's no other way


Come drift the town where secrets lie

Where friends and neighbours keep drifting by

But that's alright

You're here to stay

Sing out tonight

The empty page


I always thought I'd see

Your name in flashing light

You did it all for free, girl

And freely ripped the night

You're free to fight


These are the words but not the truth

God bless them all when they speak to you

But that's alright

You're here to stay

Sing out tonight

The empty page


Do you remember the time

When you were new in town

You smashed your head in the mirror, baby

And kissed the frozen ground

Yr ripped up sound


The empty page has wasted down

The empty page is ripped

The empty page will waste this town

The empty page has slipped

// Disconnection Notice //

Did you get your disconnection notice?

Mine came in the mail today

They seem to think I'm disconnected

Don't think I know what to read or write or say

Glossaries injected daily

Words and numbers spell out the price to pay

It simply states "you're disconnected baby"

See how easily it all slips away


This is no direction

Prepare for the city

Angels turn on heaven's light


Hurry up, the stage awaits you

Don't forget to memorize your lines

Can you hear them congratulate you?

Out of step just can't find the time

Will we pass thru undetected?

Everything's right here inside our file

You're not so free to be so unprotected

A secret Mona Lisa hides behind her smile


This is no direction

Prepare for the city

Angels turn on heaven's light


Did you get your disconnection notice?

Mine came in the mail today

They seem to think I'm disconnected

Don't think I know what to read or write or say

Glossaries injected daily

Words and numbers spell out the price to pay

It simply states "you're disconnected baby"

See how easily it all slips away

// Rain On Tin //

We all hope

To signal kin

Rays of gold

Now rain on tin

Gather round

Gather friends

Never fear

Never again

// Karen Revisited //

Heard your name the other day

It's been a long, long time

Ancient history, some would say

Another state of mind

You smell of memory

Felt-tipped electric child


She takes a plastic pill

She plays the weatherman

She screams "Religion kills

More than it saves you, man"

She painted filigrees

She was the acid queen

She claims society

Is just a fever dream


Now you live in the trees and salty seas

Trippin' out in the blue skies

You shut the door on everything

Too busy getting high

And me, just another dream theory

Lost inside your eyes


She's not in your history books

Lost her mind and kept her looks

Down beneath the radar screen

She's lit up like gasoline

Been thru a million kix

Looking for the one that sticks

Never would've known it then

I might not see her again


Top hats and tails for thrills

Red lips and famous hands

Sidelong and glancing still

In tiny dancer land


We kissed

Time slipped

Hard edged

Tight lipped

See you

Some time

Ask me if I care


Karen

Miss communication

Karen

// Radical Adults Lick Godhead Style //

Send the moon thru the skylight

Bells together outrageously

Noiseball, flirtatious example

Bless her soul to further degree

Theatre goddess, film destroyer

New York girls are sure to enjoy her

Fuzzy peach, teenage computer

A shocking figure in the eye of the universe


I am dead by the beauty of strangers

In horror my eye-head transforms them

Into smiling beautific roommates

From dust to dust they create rock and roll

Here comes something: you are Lou Reed

Transformer cracked by the backyard stream

Killer tunes, bubblegum disaster

Radical adults lick godhead style.

// Plastic Sun //

Plastic girl with plastic gun

Plastic smile under plastic sun

You burn my heart with your frigid stare

Rip me off with your greasy hair

([JANE:] "britney spear")

I hate you and your fishy friends

I hate you and it never ends


Plastic girl with plastic gun

Plastic smile under plastic sun

You burn my heart with your frigid stare

Rip me off with your greasy hair

([JANE:] "britney spear")

I hate you and your fishy friends

I hate you and it never ends


Tired of the times I wound up dead

Tired of the dogs inside your head

Tired of the needles beside your bed

Tired of the crap you keep me fed

Tired of the people you keep misled

Your blood is turning my blue eyes red

Get your hands off my tomato

Cherry juice on a rotten potato

Subway slasher's on my ass

Steals my money and smokes my grass

Watch your back or you're dead meat baby

Throw a dog a bone and you still get rabies


Plastic girl with plastic gun

Plastic smile under plastic sun

You burn my heart with your frigid stare

Rip me off with your greasy hair

([JANE:] "britney spear")

I hate you and your fishy friends

I hate you and it never ends

// Sympathy For The Strawberry //

Let me introduce you

(feel the wind soooo)

Since you saw my shadow self

Living underneath you

(over here)

She can't resist a tickle out

I'm a girl scout

Searching for the new stuff


Did I mention that it melts away

(all gone)

She puts a sign out

(I want a)

Out of order

(I want a building that stays)

Makes you strongly disobey

Guiding you away

(I promised you)

Chiding you away


So quick to hide when I turn around

She will rise just to embarass me

She likes to dance when it's dark inside

Just a flashlight there, for a guide

Try to catch me if you can

It's free and wild, watch where you stand

Below the net, desire it grows and grows

Like a strawberry not a rose

Prickly patch don't you stand on me

Squishin' down in the mud

Aah!

In your eye
