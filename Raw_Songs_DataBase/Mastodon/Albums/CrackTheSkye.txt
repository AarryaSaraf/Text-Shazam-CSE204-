Album: CrackTheSkye

// Oblivion //

I flew beyond the sun before it was time
Burning all the gold that held me inside my shell
Waiting for you to pull me back in
I almost had the world in my sight

Lost love, bright eyes fading
Faster than stars falling
How can I tell you that I've failed?
Tell you I failed

Falling from grace cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion

I tried to burrow a hole into the ground
Breaking all the fingers and the nails from my hand
The eyes of a child see no wrong
Ignorant bliss, impending doom

Lost love, bright eyes fading
Faster than stars falling
How can I tell you that I've failed?
Tell you I failed

Falling from grace cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost...

Falling from grace cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion

Falling from grace cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost...

Falling from grace cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion

// Divinations //

It's gone away
It's gone away
It's gone for good
Animal spirits come calling me home
Through the tunnels of brilliant light
The magnet of wisdom is pulling
Burrowing faster the fabric of time

No escape
Binding spirits
No escape
Trapped in time space

Rapid descendants
The wormhole is empty
The center of Khlysty surrounds me
The fire is dancing in a silvery sheet of breath
Black robe
Necromancing
Summon the soul of the spectre

No escape
Binding spirits
No escape
Trapped in time space

Fire in the eye
Realm of mystic majesty

No escape
Binding spirits
No escape
Trapped in time space

Fire in the eye
Realm of mystic majesty

// Quintessence //

The demon skin is covered in fine mist
Opened his hand in my hand
Holding my eyes to the future
Hovering above myself
Letting loose the guided
Punching these holes in my head
The space time paradigm

Omnipresence
Primal instincts

Let it go

Calling reason
Finding you
These wild hearts run
Even deeper
Burning through
These wild hearts run

Let it go

Letting me free the quintessence
In fine mist
Opened his hand in center
Holding my eyes to the future
Hovering above myself
Letting loose the guided
Punching these holes in my head
Losing my skin to the landslide

Omnipresence
Primal instinct

Let it go

Calling reason
Finding you
These wild hearts run
Even deeper
Burning through
These wild hearts run

Let it go

Shield failure
Speed farewell

// The Czar //

Don't stay; run away
He has ordered assassination
Don't stay; run away
The henchmen are gathered and waiting
Don't stay; run away
Your role as usurper is found out
Don't stay; run away
Tsarina has warned of the danger

It's your own fault
That is what we wanted
It's your own fault
This is where we lay

By the light of the moon
You must escape into the deep black of the night
Fight the devil inside
Enemies poison deep within my second sight
Wasting valuable time

Ride the tides of blood
Illumination
Beauties sudden hand
Shattered crown
Stretching arms up high
We're on our way now
Leave the Czar to die

Spiraling up through the crack in the sky
Leaving material world behind
I see your face in constellations
The martyr is ending his life for mine

// The Ghost Of Karelia //

Wrathful ones nine eyes gaze
Holding skulls
Filled and laced
With human blood

Shades of darkened skies
Emptiness
Twilight holding through
Offering

Life in zenith
Bulls blood shot eyes
Flattened portrait of the night sky

Feel crust hum
Facing the North
Vapor space

Between heaven and Earth
Wisdom and the knower
A planet collide
Divisible we fall

Hear dirt waves
Wading forth
Vapor space

How long has it been since we flew through the shadows
I have walked on many other planets

Sinister twin
Choking on fear
Bonded iron
Sink to the core

// Crack The Skye //

[Scott Kelly:]
Blessed visionary cut me with your sun
The rivers ran in blood
Spark fueled to fire

[Brann Dailor:]
Deep within the endless void
Searching for a sign

[Kelly:]
The vessel forged inside me
Watches over
Like the death of the moon

[Dailor:]
Strike the shepherd, sheep will scatter
Mountains of despair

[Dailor:]
I can see the pain
It is written all over your face

[Kelly:]
The screaming arrows tear through my soul
In the dawn your face is haunting
White ghostly dreams

[Dailor:]
Weight of worlds is on your shoulders
Hear the voice of gold

[Hook: Dailor]
I can see the pain
It's written all over your face

[Dailor:]
Desperate heathens flock to sirens
Guard your heartache well

[Kelly:]
Momma don't let them take her
Take her down

[Dailor:]
Please tell Lucifer he can't have this one
Her spirit's too strong

[Dailor:]
I can see the pain
It's written all over your face
I can see the pain
You can make it all go away

// The Last Baron //

I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze

Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

It is hard to see
Through all the haze at the top of the trees
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around

Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

Faltering footsteps
Dead end path
All that I need is this wise mans staff
Encased in crystal he leads the way
I guess they'd say we could set the world ablaze

Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

I guess they would say we can set the world ablaze
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around

Take my black soul
Arrive in the fires that burn my skin
Guide my eyes all through this maze
I guess they'd say we could set the world ablaze

All that I have seen
Standing on the edge
The foot of precipice
Floating in the sea
Past the king of swords
Quickly to the shore
The last baron
The last baron

Ghost of man surrounds me in my slumber
I have no fear as your wing is my shelter

Cyanide he craves
Coursing through his veins
Providing him with strength
To see this to the end
Afraid of psychic eyes
Faith in mystic power
The last baron
The last baron

Will he save me?
Will he save me?

I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it

I was standing staring at the world
And I still can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I still can't see it

I was standing staring at the world
And I still can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I still can't see it

All that I have seen
Standing on the edge
The foot of precipice
Floating in the sea
Past the king of swords
Quickly to the shore
The last baron
The last baron

Ghost of man surrounds me in my slumber
I have no fear as your wing is my shelter

Cyanide he craves
Coursing through his veins
Providing him with strength
To see this to the end
Afraid of psychic eyes
Faith in mystic power
The last baron
The last baron

Will he save me?
Will he save me?

I guess they would say we can set the world ablaze
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around

It is hard to see
Through all the haze at the top of the trees
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around

Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

Faltering footsteps
Dead end path
All that I need is this wise mans staff
Encased in crystal he leads the way
I guess they'd say we could set the world ablaze
