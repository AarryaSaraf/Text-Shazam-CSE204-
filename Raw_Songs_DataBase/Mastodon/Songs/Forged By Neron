All beneath the foot of man abed of oil and bone
A stampede where I may roam
As we swallow into earth's mouth of muck and mire
I rescue me from myself

Anywhere but here
Anyplace with a pale blue sky
Anywhere but here
All the signs tell me to fly

Come to reason where the land is dry and bones decay
A new guidance will be found
And you'll see the message in the tar of all I said
Reckless spirit lead the way

Anywhere but here
Anyplace with a pale blue sky
Anywhere but here
All the signs tell me to fly

Save your weak and dying
Save your own
Save your weak and dying
Bring them home
