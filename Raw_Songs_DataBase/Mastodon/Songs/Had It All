A thousand lights in the night
Alone in the spectrum
On this sand, I find
And realize

The light will guide you alone
I can position your way
You're going to make it

Enduring the tireless fight
Death in slow motion
I'm growing tired of this scene
Echoes in your past

The light will guide you alone
I can position your way
You're gonna to make it

You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna to make it

You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna to make it

You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna to make it

You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna to make it
