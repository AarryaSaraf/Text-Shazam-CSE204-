You reached two hands outward
Two birds spreading our wings
Today's arms turn numb
When I turn it inward

We live and breathe all your thousand words
Now you sleep, we'll finish your work

To my detriment
To my detriment
To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment

You painted us with effort
Always praising us high
The day has come to face the storm
As lightning strikes me in two

We live the dream onward as it were
Endless days we'll carry on as one

There's no doubt of what we're here to do
You laid it out
A promise of yourself

To my detriment
To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment

To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment
