Will them White Walkers?
Will them all dead?
Then come on an winter
They come on in winter
Here rebel soul to shred
Hear rebel soul to shred
Hide away your children
Then hide away yourself
Dig deep into mountain
Dig far beyond the spell

They come down
They come down the Wall
They come down
They come down the Wall

You can hear their footsteps
Crush the fresh-felt snow
You can hear them fiesting
Oh, tell me where's my crow
Harping every armory
Sharpening their blade
I pray for every one of them
And sacrifices made

They come down
They come down the Wall
They come down
They come down the Wall

So we're waiting 
We're waiting 
Hiding inside the  for winter has come

They come down
They come down the Wall
They come down
They come down the Wall
To save our souls
To save our souls
