Blessed visionary cut me with your sun
The rivers ran in blood
Spark fueled to fire


Deep within the endless void
Searching for a sign


The vessel forged inside me
Watches over
Like the death of the moon


Strike the shepherd, sheep will scatter
Mountains of despair


I can see the pain
It is written all over your face


The screaming arrows tear through my soul
In the dawn your face is haunting
White ghostly dreams


Weight of worlds is on your shoulders
Hear the voice of gold


I can see the pain
It's written all over your face


Desperate heathens flock to sirens
Guard your heartache well


Momma don't let them take her
Take her down


Please tell Lucifer he can't have this one
Her spirit's too strong


I can see the pain
It's written all over your face
I can see the pain
You can make it all go away
