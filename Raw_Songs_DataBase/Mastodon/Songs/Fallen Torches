Bring forth the enemy
Let him beg for his life
Bring forth the enemy
I want his neck on the knife
Incinerate the figurehead
I plan to erase you first
Flooded rain slathering
Bringing what you deserve

Spirits warn that danger's coming
It's coming closer now
Bad ways lit by fallen torches
Burn your insides out

Find me the remedy
Searching the ends of the earth
Bring me the entity
Snuff out the light in his eyes
Eliminate, obliterate
The image in my sight
Bring me the head, bring me the head
Finish and erase

Spirits warn that danger's coming
It's coming closer now
Bad ways lit by fallen torches
Burn your insides out

The whole world is a tragedy
Another crashing wave
Pinning you on the ground

Another living travesty
A never-ending game
Fear is the leash you shake

Free
Bring me in
Heal my heart
Break my hands

What a lesson, God
Be in my heart
Be in my heart
And when I love anew
Let it be true
Let me shield
I need to leave the shadow

The whole world is a tragedy
Another crashing wave
Pinning you on the ground

Guard the station
Mark the station
Down
