You got me wondering what to do
I can't believe it but it's true
I never fell in love again
Tonight I feel that I would fall in love with you

I keep running, I keep hiding
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running, I keep hiding
I keep wondering, got to get away from you

I don't want to be depending on
And I never needed anyone
I'm not the kind of guy to share
My life and dreams but you
Should make it seem like fun

I keep running, I keep hiding
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running, I keep hiding
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running (running) I keep hiding (oh hiding)
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running (just keep me running) I keep hiding (oh yes)
I keep wondering, got to get away from you

I keep running (keep running)
I keep hiding (and hiding)
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running (keep running)
I keep hiding (and hiding)
I keep wondering, girl, I don't know what to do
You got me running
You got me hiding (hiding)
You got me wondering, got to get away from you
You got me running (uh huh)
You got me hiding (oh yeah)
You got me wondering, what am I supposed to do?
I keep running, I keep hiding 
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running, I keep hiding 
I keep wondering, girl, I don't know what to do
You got me running, you got me hiding
You got me wondering, got to get away from you
You got me running, you got me hiding
You got me wondering, what am I supposed to do?
