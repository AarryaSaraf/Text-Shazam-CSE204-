There comes a time when it's all on the line
Where is the road gonna lead?
Ooh, you just don't know if it's safe to let go
Am I the one that you need?

Lay back and let somebody into your love (to your love)
Lay back (let it begin)
Don't they just feel "The Power of Love"?
Girl, it's real
Lay back tonight, I wanna come in

There are no walls you can build around your heart
Only to hide from the pain
We take a chance from the moment we start
Time to come in from the way

You gotta lay back and let somebody into your love (to your love)
Lay back (let it begin)
Don't they just feel "The Power of Love"?
Girl, it's real
Lay back tonight

Destiny has written less in ending
Are we old enough to let it slip away? 
Open up, time to start depending
On the one you really need, baby, trust in me and lay back

Lay back and let somebody into your love (to your love)
Lay back (let it begin)
Don't they just feel "The Power of Love"
Girl, it's real
Lay back tonight, I wanna come in

Lay back and let somebody into your love (to your love)
Lay back, oh
Don't they just feel "The Power of Love"
Girl, it's real
You got to lay back tonight, I wanna come in
Ooh, come on and lay back
(I want you to lay back)
Lay back and let me into your love
(I want you to lay back)
(Baby, lay back)
Come over, baby
(I want you to lay back)
(Baby, lay back)
(I want you to lay back)
(Baby, lay back)
(I want you to lay back)
(Baby, lay back)
(I want you to lay back)
(Baby, lay back)
