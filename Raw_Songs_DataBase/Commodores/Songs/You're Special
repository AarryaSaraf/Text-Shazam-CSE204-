Good morning sunshine
A sweet morning too
A flower that blooms every day

Such a perfect smile
That makes me dream a while
About all the things I see in you

It's all because
You're special
What else can I say
I can only say how much I love you sweet baby

You're special
It's how I feel when I am with you

You're special
Each and every way

You're special

You are a friend in time of need
Whatever I need I know you'll be there

Yeah. Yes I'm a man and a man is supposed to be strong,
But I can't go on without your love

That's all because

You're special
There's so much more I wanna do for you baby

You're special
I'm so in love with you

You're special
Touch me tenderly

You're special
Sugar. All the things you do to me. Yeah!

Girl you're so special
Uh baby. Some kind of lady
You're my kind of lady

You're special
Uh. Some kind of lady

You're special
Some kind of lady
My kind of lady

You're special
Some kind of lady

Nobody would know what you do to me
Lord knows what you've done for feeling free
Girl you give me what I never ever had before
You keep me risin' back for more
