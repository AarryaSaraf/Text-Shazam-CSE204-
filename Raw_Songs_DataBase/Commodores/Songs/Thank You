I've been thinking lately
'bout the time you spend with me
and I've been wondering 
if you really knew

Everybody needs someone 
To help them through the maze
Did you realize my someone's you

I've been down and out and you've been there
I've been less then kind sometimes I know
I don't have to see your face to know you care
And you've been a friend to me

Thank you, for being mine forever girl
For being by my side
You know I love you
And I need you too.. Thank you

Sometimes when it's late at night
And everything is cold
I think about you and I feel warm inside
Maybe I've neglected you
And so its time you told
You have helped me make it through my life

Let me say the words that you should hear
Let me say them till I made it clear
You're my lady
I believed that love is more than just a kiss
And you have shown me this
