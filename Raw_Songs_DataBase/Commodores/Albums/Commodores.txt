Album: Commodores

// Zoom //

I may be just a foolish dreamer
But I don't care
Cause I know my happiness
Is waiting out there, somewhere

I'm searching for that silver lining
Horizons that I've never seen
Whoa, I'd like to take just this moment
And dream my dream, whoa dream my dream

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind, oh Lord, is fresh and clear
And I'll find the love that I long to see
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

Whoa, I'd like to greet the sun each morning
And walk amongst the stars at night
I'd like to know the taste of honey
In my life, in my life

Well, I've shared so many pains
And I've played so many games
Ah, but everyone finds the right way
Somehow, somewhere, someday

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind can be fresh and clear
And I'll find the love that I long to see
People can be what they wanna be

Ooh, ooh...

Whoa, I wish the world were truly happy
Living as one
I wish the world they call freedom
Someday would come, some day would come, baby

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind can be fresh and clear
And I'll find the love that I long to see
Everybody can be what they wanna be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, baby

(I-I-I-I) Zoom-zoom (baby)
I'd like to fly away (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom-zoom (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom (zoom, baby)
I'd like to fly away (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom-zoom (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom (zoom, baby)
I'd like to fly away (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom-zoom (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom (zoom, baby)

Zoom (I-I-I-I)
(Babe) Zoom-zoom (baby, yeah)
Zoom (you and me, baby)
(Walking free)
(Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go)
(Hey, yeah, babe, babe, babe, babe)
(Yeah)
(Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go)

// Won't You Come Dance With Me //

I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
Sitting home on this lonely night
With nothin' much to do
I remember the good times
When they all were spent with you
How I long to see you smile
And to dance the night away

I wanna be with you..whoa

[Chorus:]
Cause I feel like laughin'
..let's laugh together
Cause I feel like singin'
..let's sing forever
Cause I feel like dancin'
..let's dance together

Find a hideaway..getaway for two

I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
Hey I sure think the time is right
I've got so much in store

Cause I just wanna be with you
And do the things we did before
Don't wanna seem like I'm begging you
But I think tonight's the night
Why can't I be with you

[Chorus]

Can I slip away..faraway with you

I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me

I'll play the music

Do dah do dah yeah
Do dah do dah yeah
Do dah do dah yeah
Do dah do dah yeah

I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me

// Brick House //

She's a brick house
She's mighty, mighty
Just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick house
I like ladies stacked
And that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

She's a brick house
Well, we're together everybody knows
This is how the story goes

She knows she's got everything
That a woman needs to get a man
How can she lose with the stuff she use?
36-24-36, what a winning hand

'Cause she's a brick house
She's mighty, mighty
Just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick house
I like ladies stacked
And that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

She's a brick house
She's the one, the only one
Built like an Amazon

The clothes she wear, her sexy ways
Make a old man wish for younger days
She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sure enough can knock a strong man to his knees

'Cause she's a brick house
She's mighty, mighty
Just lettin' it all hang out
A brick house
I like ladies stacked
That's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

Shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now

Brick house
She's mighty, mighty
Just lettin' it all hang out
Brick house
She's the one, the only one
Built like an Amazon

Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it, shake it

Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it!

A brick house

// Funky Situation //

Well, it's a little bit funny
Or so it seems
How I met this girl
Was like a dream
It was late one night
She was a beautiful sight
Standin' thin and tall
Her dress mostly nothin' at all
She's bad..I know
I'm glad..wow
She's more than I ever had..more than I ever had

She dance so close to me
Moves so differently

[Chorus:]
Could it be love..it's a funky situation
Could it be love..it's beyond my imagination
Could it be love..she's such a sweet temptation
Could it be love
It's funky..it's funky..it's funky
It's a funky situation
It's funky..it's funky..it's funky
It's a funky situation

She goes for me
She sets my soul on fire
Every day and night
I have such desire
To hold her close to me
To touch her tenderly

Ohh..it's so thrilling
To know she's willingâ€¦yeah
..makes me scream
..she's a love machine

Oww..I just can't describe
This feelin' that I have inside

[Chorus]

Could it be love
Could it be love
It's funky..it's funky..it's funky
It's a funky situation
It's funky..it's funky..it's funky
It's a funky situation

Funky situation
She's so fine
Mine all mine
Funky situation
Oww..yeah
Sweet thing
Sweet thing

// Easy //

Know it sounds funny
But I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl
You know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole
And I borrowed

Ooh, that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

Why in the world
Would anybody put chains on me?
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be
What they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it!
No!

Ooh, that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know
The things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me, babe!

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
Because I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning
Because I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning
