// Young Girls Are My Weakness //

Young girls are my weakness
Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
Young girls are my weakness

Hey girls let's mess around
I wanna party with you on the town
Some girls really make me swing
There ain't nothin' like a pretty young thing

Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness

Young girls are really mellow
You don't believe me then just try this fellow
(I know what to say when they call me on the phone)
You call me back when your dad leaves home

Young girls you make me move
Young girls you set the groove
Young girls sweet as honey
Young girls take all my money

(pretty girl what ya gonna do?)
I just wanna get me hands on YOU

Hey girls let's mess around
I wanna party with you on the town
some girls really make me swing
There ain't nothin' like a pretty young thing 

Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness

Young girls you make me move
Young girls you set the groove
Young girls sweet as honey
Young girls take all my money

Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness

// I Feel Sanctified //

Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified

I just left my baby's house
And I got the strength I needed
Knowing that the beast of man
Is very hard to please

I'm so glad the sun is shining
To brighten up the day
Cause behind last night
I see things in a different way

Yeah, I feel sanctified
(Feel it, feel it my soul, yeah)
Yeah, I feel sanctified

She led me to the peak of love
And no words could ever describe
Oh, when you get that kind of loving
It's a blessing to be alive

Ooh, the sacred feeling
Just blows through my soul
Searching for sanctuary
To rest it must explode

Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified

She led me to the peak of love
And no words could ever describe
Oh, when you get that kind of loving
It's a blessing to be alive

Ooh, the sacred feeling
Just blows through my soul
Searching for sanctuary
To rest it must explode

Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
