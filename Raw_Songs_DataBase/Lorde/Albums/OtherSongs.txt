// Break The Ice //

[Britney Spears:]
But I'm here now

[Lorde:]
I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
And I was thinking 'bout how you say my name
You got my body spinning, like a hurricane
It feels like I'm going insane

So, let me get it up

Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
That ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
That ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

// Easy //

Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy

Easy, easy
You switch the screens over the
Rest of your flows
Easy, easy
They poke around until they
Get what they want
Easy, easy

Oh, easy, easy
Throw out the lunch you paid for
Thought it would suck, but now it's
Easy, oh, easy
Throw out the lunch you paid for
Oh, easy, easy

Easy, easy
Pull out the heart that keeps you
Feeling alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy

// Everybody Wants To Rule The World //

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own desire
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom
And of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad we had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world

// Flicker (Kanye West Rework) //

I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat

// Good Fights //

Face the world, tell your friends
You don't really love them
But you really love when
Braid your hair and give in
We could try to get in to the place where it ends
Where everything ends, it spins again

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people that are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

There's a place in your head for what doesn't make sense
For the things you don't get
Look them up when you get in
We could try to get in, get rejected again
Laugh it off again, I guess oh well

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

Incurred on to bright green eyes
You used to love to spend up time
Driving like a coil in the little lights out
Money, we solve our safe
She'll toss her head and play again
Examine every face and realize
Oh, it's good to feel again

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

// Homemade Dynamite (Remix) //

[Lorde:]
A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flyin' with nowhere to be, ooh-ooh
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome, right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
See me rollin', showin' someone else love
Dancin' with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?

[Lorde (SZA):]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
(Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite)

[Khalid:]
I wanna feel the light
Pushing our limits, unbuckled for the ride, mm
We're way too far from home
Let's be honest with ourselves
We're way too high to drive
So let's take on the night (Mmm)
If the light is in the air, open, finally
We're going and we're free

[Khalid & Lorde:]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[SZA:]
I checked your girl at the door
I sent your friend to the store
It's only me and you, finally us two
And I don't regret drinkin' this liquor
Makin' you listen
Yeah, I know you don't know me well
My girl's at the door and I left my pretense at home
And it ain't no goin' back (Goin' back)

[SZA & Lorde:]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Post Malone:]
Walk, never fall, but we still run
So pour up, pour up another one
I know, I know we on to somethin'
We got, we got a loaded gun, yeah
Go and shoot me that look in your eyes
And you're here, I'm yours, you're mine
Find each other when we're losin' our minds
Then we take it all off
You're a runaway train, yeah
And you got me so faded
And I don't wanna chase it, no
You know I think you're awesome, right?

[All (Post Malone):]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite (Yeah, yeah)
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
(Blowin' shit up)

[Lorde:]
Now you know it's really gonna blow

// Ladder Song //

No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying

I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship
Let my mama hang and my sister sit

It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sundowns
And a twisting mind

If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine

Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagine freedom

All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling, that rope will break

We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky

See now, a star bursts
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine?

Will I know when it's finally done?
This whole life's a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be

// Mama Do //

Every night I go
Every night I go
Sneaking out the door
I lie a little more
Baby I'm helpless

There's something about the night
And the way it hides all the things I like
Little black butterflies
Deep inside me

What would my mama do
She knew about me and you?
What would my daddy say
She saw me hurt this way?

Why should I feel ashamed?
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name
Yeah, here we are again
It's nearly perfect

What would my mama do
She knew about me and you?
What would my daddy say
He saw me hurt this way?

// Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard //

Mama pajama rolled outta bed
And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout
He started the investigation

It was against the law, it was against the law
What my mama saw, it was against the law

And the mama looked down and she spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
And the papa said "Oh, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"

Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
And I'm on my way, it's taking to town but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, queen of Corona
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard

In a couple of days they're gonna take me away
When the press let the story leak
I have no reason, I have no reason
And we was all on the cover of Newsweek

Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way, I'll take to town but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, queen of Corona
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Oh, me and Ella in Golden Gate Park

// No Better //

We roll in heavy summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to

And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short-lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath a ceiling or a roof try come out and steal our thunder

Now the days are getting cooler
And the burning of our limbs doesn't happen quite as bad and the burn is just
Skin-deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter like the movies
That we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go I can feel a subtle taste of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning but you come over at night and we practice all the breathing

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

// Precious Metals //

The Chanel, the Dior and the Prada
Take it home, make a fire in the garden
Sundance kids, so godless
One day it's gonna be not like this
Black sand on all our beaches
Witchcraft, split lip and a bee sting
But what I really wanna know is

Do I look like a fool?
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do, I do, I do
To hold on to precious metals like I do, I do, I do

The Chanel, the Dior, and the Prada
Give my best to the ones that are bothered
Take a flight trip to Jakarta
All the kids at the shows make it louder
All of the feelings and all of the tears are going
All of the secrets and all of the schemes that don't go my way
I wish you would come back, didn't want to run back
Come back, bet you want to come back
And I'll find you

Do I look like a fool?
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do (ah), do (ah), do (ah)
To hold on to precious metals like I do (ah), do (ah), do (ah)

Ah, ah, ah...

// Supercut (El-P Remix) //

[Lorde:]
In my
Supercut of us
Supercut
Supercut of, supercut of, supercut of us

In my head
I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us

In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the supercut of us
We keep tryna talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watchin' our love
In your car, the supercut of, supercut of

[Killer Mike:]
We is the villains, and there ain't no chillin'
Get body bags and the toe tags, yeah
Scoundrels in housin', we tore through your town
And we reload it and now we back, man
Forgiato rollin' on a '96 Impala
With a pretty thing, show me where I'm slayin'
I ain't playin' with you lames, 700 horse in the Hellcat
Take ya bitch, where ya at?

[El-P:]
Dirty, all-black Jeep, 2018
With the clean rhyme rappers on deck, check
Came with the bad bars, bully with the big box
Shush when the runners on set
G-G-Give it up, you don't got a bit of luck left
Nah, not even a itty bit of fresh (Good lord)
Fall on your sword for the crime abhorrent
That's your reward for the mindless whorin'

[Killer Mike:]
This for everybody that hated
Michael and Jamie, we made it
Every debt due, we paid it
My cadence is heinous
You keep tryna play us, and you gon' be famous
And just like the top on my 7-5 drop
I'm just hittin' a button and you gon' be brainless
And that's from the back of a 'lac where I'm smokin' the sack
With my girl, watchin' seasons of Shameless

[El-P:]
There's no manual, Run The Jewels publish shit annual
Every minute I'm in it, I'm runnin' a clinic
Wild animal, livin' like a Fine Young Cannibal
Citizen of cynics, admit it, the kid get it
Earth's a hot block, the pot get chop-chopped
You walk and watch blocks my heart should pop off
The hot rocks shooters will knock your whole op off
That's why I don't got tocks on the clock to rock soft

[Lorde:]
So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a su–

Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of, supercut of, super, super

// Swingin' Party //

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, I never learned how to swim now

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

// Use Somebody //

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
