But I'm here now


I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
And I was thinking 'bout how you say my name
You got my body spinning, like a hurricane
It feels like I'm going insane

So, let me get it up

Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
That ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
That ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
