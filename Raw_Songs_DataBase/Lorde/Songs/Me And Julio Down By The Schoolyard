Mama pajama rolled outta bed
And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout
He started the investigation

It was against the law, it was against the law
What my mama saw, it was against the law

And the mama looked down and she spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
And the papa said "Oh, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"

Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
And I'm on my way, it's taking to town but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, queen of Corona
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard

In a couple of days they're gonna take me away
When the press let the story leak
I have no reason, I have no reason
And we was all on the cover of Newsweek

Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way, I'll take to town but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, queen of Corona
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Oh, me and Ella in Golden Gate Park
