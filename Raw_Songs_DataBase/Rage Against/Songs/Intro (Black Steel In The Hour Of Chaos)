 Hey check this out right about now....

I wanna introduce a brotha...who came all the way outta here 

from Long Island, New york. And he's one of the fathers of 

revolutionary music in our time period. He was a huge influence

on us and we wanna bring him out right now. So check it out, we 

got a man by the name of Chuck D, from Public Enemy. Yeah.
 Wassup, wassup! Zack: Yo....


 "I got a letter from the government

The other day

I opened and read it

It said they were suckers

They wanted me for their army or whatever

Picture me given' a damn - I said never

Here is a land that never gave a damn

About a brother like me and myself

Because they never did

I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute...

It occured to me

The suckers had authority

Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell

How long has it been?

They got me sittin' in the state pen

I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before

I contemplated a plan on the cell floor

I'm not a fugitive on the run

But a brother like me begun - to be another one

Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all

To criticize me for some crime - never the less

They could not understand that I'm a Black man

And I could never be a veteran

On the strength, the situation's unreal

I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel"


Yeah!
