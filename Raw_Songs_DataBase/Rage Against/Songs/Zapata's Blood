Zapata's blood

Wasn't spilt in vain

So now the most poor wage war

To reclaim their name


Zapata's blood


Wasn't spilt in vain


So now the most poor wage war

To reclaim their terrain


On January 1st , 1994

The indigenous farmers of Southern Mexico

Declared war on an unjust

and illegitimate government


Out of the debt of the most wild, the most poor

Came a just arm struggle

for democracy, justice, and liberty

And it won't stop until that 65 year old dictatorship, 

the Partido Revolucionario Institucional

(Institutional Revolutionary Party) is buried in the 

ground

and the people's voice is heard once again


Yeah


So check it out:

On January 1st, of 94 they became known as 

the Zapatista movement

And they have a saying, and I want you all to 

sing along with me real quick.

It goes something like this

It goes everything for everyone...

and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Yeah, sing that shit...

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves...
