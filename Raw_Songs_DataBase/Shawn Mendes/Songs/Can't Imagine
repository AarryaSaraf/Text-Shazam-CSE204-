I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine what a world would be
Without you
All the birds would stop their songs
Without you
All things right would feel so wrong
I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
Without you

I'd always be alone
Without you
I don't know where to go
I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world could be
I can't imagine what a world would be

I can't imagine
I can't imagine, no
I can't imagine, no, what a world would be

Without you
I'd always be alone
I'd always be alone

Cool, that's good for now
