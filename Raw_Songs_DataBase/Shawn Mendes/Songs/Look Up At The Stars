Look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground

It's a Friday night
And the streetlights are all saying your name
They always say your name
Before you go home
I should let you know
I'm so glad that you came
I know that we went late, but

Look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far
The universe is ours
I'm not gonna let you down

I am feeling so lucky (Lucky, lucky, lucky)
The sun shining down on me (On me, on me, on me)
Got these angels all around me
I'll never be alone

Look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far
The universe is ours
And I'm not gonna let you down

Finally we've met
Now the lights are set
It's taken us till now
To be together in this town, yeah
A couple of years we've been making plans
Somehow you always seem to understand
So let me spend the night in wonderland with you

I am feeling so lucky (Lucky, lucky, lucky)
The sun shining down on me (On me, on me, on me)
Got these angels all around me
I'll never be alone

Look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far
The universe is ours
And I'm not gonna let you down
