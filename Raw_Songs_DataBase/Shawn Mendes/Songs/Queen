It's hard to believe you don't remember me at all
Am I hard to recognize?
You say "Nice to meet you" every time, yeah
And I made you laugh, I still remember what I said
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
You say "Nice to meet you" every time

I know we got a lot of mutual friends
Don't say my name, don't come up in your conversations, yeah

Who crowned you
Queen of "You think you're too cool"
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me
Like I got nothing on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

I shouldn't stress about the fact you're not impressed
Are you playing hard to get
Or maybe you're not interested
I don't understand why everybody thinks you're sweet
'Cause I see the opposite
No, you're not so innocent

I see the way you're lookin' through me right now
To see if there's somebody cooler around, yeah

Who crowned you
Queen of "You think you're too cool"
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me
Like I got nothing on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

No no no no no
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?

Who crowned you
Queen of "You think you're too cool"
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
Yeah... naaah, yeah
You treat me
Like I got nothing on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?
Yeah, you think you're too cool, nah
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?
