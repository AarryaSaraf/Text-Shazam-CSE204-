It's a fairy tale I can't explain
Full of words I don't know how to say
And without a little twist of fate
I know I'd still be searching, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you

And you've seen all my darkest fears
Like you've known me for a thousand years
The boy who's really underneath
All the scars and insecurities, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

It's always been you, yeah!
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
