You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You're just like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last, love has arrived
And I just thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothin' else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
So if you feel how I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you, baby
And if it's quite alright
I need you, baby
For the lonely nights
My, pretty baby
Just know that it's true

Oh, pretty baby
Don't hold me down, I pray
I need you baby
Now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you

You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off of you
You're just like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I just thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off of you

I love you, baby
And if it's quite alright
I need you, baby
For the lonely nights
I need you baby
Just know that it's true, yeah

Oh, pretty baby
Don't hold me down, I pray
I need you baby
Now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you
