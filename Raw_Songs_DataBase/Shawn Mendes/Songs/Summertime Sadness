Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

She's got her red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done her hair, real big beauty queen style
High heels off, feelin' allive

And, oh my god, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
If I die tonight, I'll be alright

And, oh my god, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness

Summertime sadness...

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness, yeah
