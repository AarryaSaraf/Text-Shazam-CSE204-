The only substitution when it's not your eyes, yeah
Can't get enough, it's official
I want a lot and not a little
If we keep it us it's so simple
Wherever you are, wherever you are

Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are

Twenty minutes till I'm home
And tell me all the ways you wanna make this go
No, I can't get enough now, it's official
You want a lot and not a little
If we keep it us it's so simple
Wherever you are, wherever you are

Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
