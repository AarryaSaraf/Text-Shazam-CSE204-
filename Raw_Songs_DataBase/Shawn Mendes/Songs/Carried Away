We had nights of endless music
We were dizzy dancing 'til the dawn
We were free, singing sweet harmonies with the city
But maybe that was someone else's song

Back to Earth again
You knew where this was headed and honestly you're better off
Better here where you belong

You got caught up in the colors
You got wrapped up in the ride
You thought the feeling was forever
And the stars were on your side
It was lovely while it lasted
But it wasn't meant to stay
Still, you let yourself get carried away
I guess I let myself get carried away

We got carried away, carried away
Got carried away, carried away

So we got mixed up in the madness
But wasn't it a perfect mess we made?
Well you live and you learn, you read signs and it's safe and it's simple
And behind our walls we fall back into place

Back to Earth again
You're through with pretending 'cause this is how the ending goes
Now you're here where you belong

We got caught up in the colors
We got wrapped up in the ride
We thought the feeling was forever
And the stars were on our side
It was lovely while it lasted
But it wasn't meant to stay
We just let ourselves get carried away

We got carried away, carried away
Got carried away, carried away
Carried away (Lost in the fantasy), carried away (Of all we were gonna be)
Carried away, carried away

It was lovely while it lasted
It was never meant to stay
But we let ourselves get carried away
I guess I let myself get carried away
