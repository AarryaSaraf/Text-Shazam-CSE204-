Ooh, your body's like an ocean
I'm devoted
To explore you
Ooh, what do you desire
I'm inspired
I'll do it for you

Won't you draw a map for me
Laced with strawberries
And I'll get on my knees

Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you
Teach me how to love
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love

Your imagination
Now I'm fixated
And I'm dying to learn
Every inch of you, there's something new
F'ing me up
I'm what you deserve

Just draw a map for me
Laced with strawberries
And I'll get on my knees

Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you
Teach me how to love
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love

How to love
How to love
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love

Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love

Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love

Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush

Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you
Teach me how to love
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love

How to love
How to love
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
How to love
How to love
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love

Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love

Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop till you feel the rush
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
