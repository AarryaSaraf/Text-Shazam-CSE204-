I wake up
A little drunk
Check my phone
I'm all alone
Ten missed calls
A couple texts
None of them are who I'm looking for
Who I'm looking for, yeah

This is a song for no one
This is a song for no one

Get on a plane
Fly to the most beautiful place you've ever been
Close my eyes
Things are better in my dreams
'Cause I'm with someone
Someone I adore

This is a song for no one
I wrote this song for no one

Yesterday, I got pretty drunk
Said some things that I shouldn't of
Told you that I really love you
You did not reciprocate those feelings
But that's okay, I'll be fine anyway

Oh, yeah

I wrote this song for no one
I wrote this song
Woo, woo, woo, woo
No, I wrote this song for no one
