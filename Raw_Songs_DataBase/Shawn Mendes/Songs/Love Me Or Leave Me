Can I open my mouth and let the words come spilling now?
Show you the side of me that I hadn't figured out
And I want you to know all the things that I think about
Can I let it out?
Cause I want you to be there
Yeah, I want you to be there

If I told you my secrets
And I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts
And showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?

Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?

Could you talk to the night if I told you I never sleep?
Could you be the air in my lungs when I can't breathe?
And sometimes when I quite as strong as I wanna be
Swear I want you to be there
Be there, be there

If I told you my secrets
And I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts
And showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?

Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?

Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?

So much of me I wanna let go
So many things I need you to know
So much of me I wanna let go, oh
So much of me I wanna let go
So many things I need you to know
So much of me I wanna let go, oh, oh

If I told you my secrets
And I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts
And showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?

Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
