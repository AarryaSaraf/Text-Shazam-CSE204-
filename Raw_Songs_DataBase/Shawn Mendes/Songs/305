It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
Never been so sure in my life

You're my sunlight on a rainy day
Would take my heart with you if you walked away
I'm a mess right now
I'm a wreck right now
I'm waiting for the moment that you let me down

If you cut the cord
I don't know what I'd do
Don't wanna skydive without my parachute
I'm a mess right now
Baby, help me out
I'm scared I'm gonna wake up
And you'll let me down

This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night

It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
Never been so sure in my life
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
I've never been so sure in my life

If there's a door to heaven, baby, you're the key
And if I had to beg, I'd be on my knees
Oh, please don't say
Anything has changed
You're the one I wanna wake up next to every day

This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night

It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
Never been so sure in my life
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
I've never been so sure in my life

(I want to be with you)
(I want to fly with you)
(I want to be with you)

It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
Never been so sure

Baby, I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
(Hoping you don't change your mind)
Please, don't change your mind (I don't wanna let go)
(I've never been so sure in my life)
