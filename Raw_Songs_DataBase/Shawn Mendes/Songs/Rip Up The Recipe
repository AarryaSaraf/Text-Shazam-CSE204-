When you're cookin' somethin' up
And only tryin' the tried and true
You stick to the predictable you've known
Measure out the same amounts
Every teaspoon, every ounce
No surprises when the rules are set in stone

But when the sugar hits the fan
You make a mess of your perfect plan
And you're facin' the face of somethin' strange and new
If it's not what you had prepared
In the scramble, you can't get scared
Let somethin' wild and wonderful break through

Start rippin' up the recipe
Let go of how it has to be
You forget about right and wrong
When you lose yourself in the song
It's perfect unexpectedly
When you rip up the recipe

Doot-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

Livin' life inside the lines safe and simple, by the book
You keep sweepin' the uncertainty aside
But an unfamiliar spice might bring somethin' extra nice
Somethin' twice as good as what you woulda tried

'Cause when the sugar hits the fan
You make a mess of your perfect plan
And you're facin' the face of somethin' strange and new
Somethin's ready to wreck your day
You can pray that it goes away
Or let somethin' wild and wonderful break through

Start rippin' up the recipe
Let go of how it has to be
No, you can't plan it in advance
Gotta lose yourself in the dance
It's perfect unexpectedly
When you rip up the recipe

Doot-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

Start rippin' up the recipe
And make a little mess with me
You forget about right and wrong
When you lose yourself in the song
It's perfect unexpectedly
When you rip up the recipe

Doot-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo, doo

When you rip up the recipe
