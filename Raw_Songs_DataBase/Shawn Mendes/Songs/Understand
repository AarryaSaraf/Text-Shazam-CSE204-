Am I asking all these questions for nothing?
I'm wondering if anyone's there, yeah
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared, yeah

But I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Praying that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
I'm praying that I don't forget just who I am

I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand

I'm calling all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody cares

Cause I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
I'm praying that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
I'm praying that I don't forget just who I am

I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand, yeah

Oh yeah

Cause we all get lost sometimes, yeah
Yeah we all get lost sometimes
But don't leave your heart behind, no, yeah
Cause we all get lost sometimes

I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah
No I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, oh who I am


When you wake up
Your whole world's flipped
It's just different and you gotta, you know
You gotta, you gotta go with it and
That's just simply growing up
And not see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it's been given to you
I mean, as much as times can be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
You're not gonna feel out of place anymore
You're gonna feel like that's where you are meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go and, and grow with it
And you can't hold on
To the old you
Or the old this
Or the old that
Because you know you change
And it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing
Because that's what happens in life
You grow up
Everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing
It never was
But at the end of the day, you know
You're the same person
And, and where your heart is
That doesn't change

And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am

I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah
No I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, oh who I am
