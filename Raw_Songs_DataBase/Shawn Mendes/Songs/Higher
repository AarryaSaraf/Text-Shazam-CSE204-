I can't get much higher

New York in the summertime
Get close with a bottle of wine
Last year was a broken heart
Last year was a broken heart
Last year was a broken heart
Damn, flip it around, what a beautiful start

You and me on the top of the roof
Slow dance in the light of the moon
Never thought it would get this far
Never thought it would get this far
Never thought it would get this far
Wow, flip it around, what a beautiful start

The drinks are getting better
The view is looking nice
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever
I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No, I can't get much higher

All eyes are looking at us
But I can't stop falling in love
Always been the one that I want
Always been the one that I want
Always been the one that I want
Wow, look at us now, damn, what have we done
I almost can't believe it
So please don't wake me if I'm dreaming
Whenever I'm with you

The drinks are getting better
The view is looking nice
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No, I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever
I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No, I can't get much higher

Say
Say you won't let go
All I know is I can't get much higher
I can't get much higher

The drinks are getting better
The view is looking nice
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No, I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever
I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No, I can't get much higher
