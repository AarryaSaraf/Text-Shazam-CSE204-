All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you

I don't know how this will go
I promise that I'll love you so
I'll bet it all on me and you
I'll bet it all you're bulletproof

Let's throw away our backup plans
And people might not understand
Who cares about if they approve
I'd face them all to be with you

All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
We could dance, you could throw the flowers
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you

I heard that once a wise man said
Only fools go rushing in
But I'm not the type to overthink
When something feels so right
And I promise I mean every word
I'll paint the world that you deserve
Every color you'd imagine
I can't wait for it happen

'Cause all it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
We could dance, you could throw the flowers
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you

I heard that once a wise man said
Only fools go rushing in
But I'm not the type to overthink
I'm not the type to overthink
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you

All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you
