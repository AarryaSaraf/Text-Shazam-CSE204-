You can pack your bags and start skipping town
Hang up your hat when the show shuts down
But when the world says you ain't quite world-renowned
Don't count yourself out yet

When you hit that lonely and lowest low
Well, up's the only way left to go
You're meant to reinvent the show
So ain't you glad we met?

Turn that dull and dusty solo
To a dazzling duet

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la

We started pretty small
But take a look at us now

Take a look at us now

Suddenly standing ten feet tall
Take a look at us now

Take a look at us now

Though we have no way to stay afloat
We were scared and saying "That's all she wrote"
We're ending on a sky-high note
Somehow
Buddy, you were all it took
So take a look at us now

When that perfect plan's going off the rails
A heap of trouble is on our tails
It's time to polish up those scales
And give it all you've got

If you're out of step

If you're out of sync

If you care too much what those critics think
Well, when you find your missing link
Don't give it a second thought
'Cause in the center of the spotlight
We just might have found our spot

Finding our luck with every leap
Take a look at us now
Take a look at us now
The road could be scared, it could be steep
Take a look at us now
Take a look at us now
Though we might look sun at first glance
Who'da thunk that we had a chance
Our life could be a song and dance
Somehow

Buddy, you were all it took

So take a look at us now

So even when you're terrified
Just find a smile a mile wide
'Cause bud, when you and I collide
Standing side by side
We're gonna take a great big bow
Would you take a look at us now?

Give us a spotlight and a crowd
Take a look at us now
Ready to sing our song out loud
Take a look at us now
Won't you take a look at us
Take a look at us
Take a look at us now
