The walls are built up, stone by stone
The fields divided one by one
And the train conductor says, "Take a break, Driver 8
Driver 8, take a break, we've been on this shift too long"

And the train conductor says (Driver 8)
"Take a break, Driver 8 (Driver 8)
Driver 8, take a break
We can reach our destination
But we're still a ways away
But we're still a ways away"

Saw a treehouse on the outskirts of the farm
The power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged
The bells are ringin' through the town again
The children look up, but all they hear is sky-blue bells ringin'

And the train conductor says (Driver 8)
"Take a break, Driver 8 (Driver 8)
Driver 8, take a break
We can reach our destination
But we're still a ways away
But it's still a ways away
But we're still a ways away
But it's still a ways away"

A way to shield the hated heat
A way to put myself to sleep
A way to shield the hated heat
A way to put myself and my children to sleep

He piloted this song in a plane like that one
And she is selling faith on the Go Tell Crusade
Locomotive 8, Southern Crescent, hear the bells ring again
And the fields of wheat is lookin' thin

And the train conductor says (Driver 8)
"Take a break, Driver 8 (Driver 8)
Driver 8, take a break
We've been on this shift too long"
And the train conductor says (Driver 8)
"Take a break, Driver 8 (Driver 8)
Driver 8, take a break
We can reach our destination
But we're still a ways away
But it's still a ways away
But we're still a ways away
But it's still a ways away"
