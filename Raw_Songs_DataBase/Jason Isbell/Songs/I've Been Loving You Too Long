I've been loving you too long to stop now
You are tired and you wanna be free
My love is growing stronger as you become a habit to me
I've been loving you a little bit too long, I don't wanna stop now

With you, my life has been so wonderful, just can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, affair grows old
And I've been loving you a little bit too long, too long to stop now

Oh, oh
I've been loving you a little bit too long
I don't wanna stop now, oh
Don't make me stop now
Don't make me stop now
I don't wanna stop now
I don't wanna stop now
'Cause I love you
I love you, I love you
Oh yes I do
I don't wanna stop now
Don't make me stop now
