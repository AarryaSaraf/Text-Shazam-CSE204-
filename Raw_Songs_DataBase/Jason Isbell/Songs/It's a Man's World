This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl

You see man made the cars, we make the road
Man made the train, we're still carrying the heavy load
Man made electric light to find a way out of the dark
Man made the boat for water, he run away from Mother Earth's arms

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Without a woman or a girl, oh

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't mean nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Just think about our little bitty baby girls and our baby boys
Man makes 'em happy 'cause man buys them toys
And after man makes everything he can
You know that man makes money
He makes all that money to steal from another man

This is a man's world, a man's world
Wouldn't mean nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

The fire, the pouring rain
Can't take us, the ones you bring
You bring your package and cut the string
You're not the only ones living in the world full of pain, full of pain

You say it's a man's world
But you wouldn't have nobody in the world
Without a woman or a girl
