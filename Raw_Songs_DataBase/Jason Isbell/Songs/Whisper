I see your rage and your quivering lip
The lines in your face, that hitch in your hips
I know this time there's no going back
The things that I owe you are things that I lack

And I found it in me to say I was wrong
Girl, you spin like a parasol and sing like a song

And I beg you to whisper
I beg you to whisper
But I know you won't whisper
'Cause folks need to hear

I should have cried for you, I did my best
I was so right for you and we were so blessed
We were the best thing that they'd ever seen
We've made them come, now they're coming between

You make me out to be made out of stone
Tell all the world that I did you so wrong

And I beg you to whisper
I beg you to whisper
But I know you won't whisper
'Cause folks need to hear

Two of us tied down to live through the ride
One could pull off anything that he tried
Two of us postmarked too long in advance
Too young to stand here and too old to dance

And I beg you to whisper
I beg you to whisper
But I know you won't whisper
'Cause folks need to hear
