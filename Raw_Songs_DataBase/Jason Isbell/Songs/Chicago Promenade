My door is locked, my debts are paid.
I'll do the Chicago promenade.
My back was turned I did not see
that shadow climbing up on me.
I took my turn at fixing hearts
but that goes bad before it starts.
I'm desperate now, I must say.
I'll do the Chicago promenade.
If I die now before I'm old
my story will be less than told.
There's so much more to suffer through
before I meet again with you.

I've tried so hard and I've been so blind.
I thought we could all grieve one at a time.

I lost a friend. It felt like five,
a man who wouldn't compromise.
I'll think of him on New Year's Day
and do the Chicago promenade.
