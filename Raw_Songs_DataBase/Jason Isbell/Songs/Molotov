Another life but I still remember
A county fair in steamy September
In the Year of the Tiger 19-something
I was broke and you were unbroken
A little jokes to keep it unspoken
Even when I knew you were the last one

I broke a promise to myself
Ride the Throttle 'til wheels came off
Burn out like a Molotov
In the night sky
I broke a promise to myself
Made a couple to a brown eyed girl
Who rode with me through the mean ol' world
Never say die

Time flies when you're making babies
Do you miss your little black Mercedes
Do you miss the girl you once had time to be
When you said we had the same three wishes
I hope you weren't being facetious
And I hope you still see fire inside of me

I broke a promise to myself
Ride the throttle 'til the wheels came off
Burn out like a Molotov
In the night sky
I broke a promise to myself
Made a couple to a browneyed girl
Who rode with me in the mean ol' world
Never say Die

I broke a promise to myself
Ride the Throttle til the wheels came off
Burn out like a Molotov
In the night sky
I broke a promise to myself
Made a couple to a brown eyed girl
Who rode with me through the mean ol' world
Never Say Die
