Your sister like to go to the drive-in movie
Your sister liked to listen to the radio
I used to think that she got off on the things I hated
She used to call me a Racetrack Romeo

'Course she wanted to know you better
I think she knew that it was her own fault
She didn't do it just to make you suffer
I think she did it just to piss me off

So merciless
So merciless she was
So merciless

There's nothin' I could say that would make this better
There's nothin' I could do that could make this worse
No, she didn't leave a note underneath my pillow
No, I didn't find an answer in her purse

Yeah I guess I shoulda seen it coming
It makes me wish I could've done it myself
After this, I'll prob'ly keep on running
There's a couple miles of highway left

So merciless
So merciless we are
So merciless

Why do people always knock so loud?
Why does everybody seem so lonely?
She would say that I should watch the crowd
Never focus on the faces only

Yeah I guess I should've seen it coming
She was givin' me the wrong advice
My is a racetrack honey
With the windows up it sounds real nice

So merciless
So merciless we are
So merciless
So merciless we are
So merciless
So merciless we are
So merciless
