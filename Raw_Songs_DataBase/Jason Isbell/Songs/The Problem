Remember Katie White?
She jumped the fence that night
She ran away in tears
Your sister drank her beer
We were just 18
The older girls could be so mean
Talking just to talk
You were still in shock

And all I could think to say
Was, "Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright
I'm on your side
I'm on your side"

What do you wanna do?
I'm scared to even say the truth
This has been the hardest year
Is it even legal here?
Trying not to think of names
Will you look at me the same?
Do you need the reasons why?
Is a chrysalis a butterfly?

And all I could think to say
Was, "Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright
I'm on your side
I'm on your side"

And no one has to know
The scars won't even show
At least that's what I've heard
No bigger than a baby bird (no bigger than a baby bird)
No bigger than a baby bird (no bigger than a baby bird)

Do you think God still sees me?
Coming out of this twilight sleep
I'm not sure who I am
Staring into my empty hands

And all I could think to say
Was, "Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright
I'm on your side
I'm on your side"
