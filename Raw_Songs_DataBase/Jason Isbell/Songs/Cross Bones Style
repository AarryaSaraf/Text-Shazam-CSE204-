Oh, how time flies with crystal clear eyes
And cold as coal when you're ending with diamond eyes

Oh, come child in a cross bones style
Oh, come child, come and rescue me
'Cause you have seen some unbelievable things
Hater, I have your diamonds and still

'Cause you have seen some unbelievable things
Oh, come child in a cross bones style
Oh, come child, come and rescue me

'Cause you have seen some unbelievable things
Hater, I have your diamonds and still, so still

Oh, how time flies with crystal clear eyes
And cold as coal when you're ending with diamond eyes

Oh, come child in a cross bones style
Oh, come child, come and rescue me
'Cause you have seen some unbelievable things

Come child
