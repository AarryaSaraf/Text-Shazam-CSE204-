Come run away with me
This ain't the world we signed up for
Echoes cross the open sea
In a place without any range war

And this is the last song I will write
This is the last time I will ever fight
For you
For you

Mama lost her second love
At a time when she really needs him
He could not have been enough
So small but still bumping the ceiling

And this is the last dream I will have
My lady, my lord, my mom and dad
All floating away into spring
All floating away into spring

You work up on your feet
And then turn away from the sunshine
It's you who've seen my worst defeat
Crawling through crumbling coal mines

And these are the last words I will sing
'Cause this is the end of everything
I'm crawling away to the sea
I'm crawling away to the sea
