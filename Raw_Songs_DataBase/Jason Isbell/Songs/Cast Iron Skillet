Don't wash the cast iron skillet
Don't drink and drive, you'll spill it
Don't ask too many questions or you'll never get to sleep
There's a hole inside you, fill it

Shower up and shave
Put flowers on the grave
And ask the Lord to save his soul
Although you know it's too late

Was it 27 times, or was it 29?
I heard the blade broke off inside the man
And he took a while to die

How did he get so low?
Seems like just a week ago
We were 10 and 12 years old

He was sweet and soft
Shied away from the inside fastballs
And died doing life without parole

Don't wash the cast iron skillet
That dog bites my kid, I'll kill it
Don't walk where you can't see your feet
Don't ask questions, just believe it

Jamie found a boyfriend
With smiling eyes and dark skin
And her daddy never spoke another word to her again

The old man at the Quickstop
Lying to the county cops
And laughing like his soul was without sin

How did he get so low?
Seems like just a week ago
She was sitting on your shoulders watching fireworks in the sky

He treats her like a queen
But you don't know 'cause you ain't seen
It's hard to go through life without your daddy by your side

Don't wash the cast iron skillet
This town won't get no better, will it?
She found love and it was simple as a weather vane
But her own family tried to kill it

Don't wash the cast iron skillet
Don't wash the cast iron skillet
Don't wash the cast iron
