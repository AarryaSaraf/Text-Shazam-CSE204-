Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum
Hoist the main sails, here I come
Ain't no room on board for the insincere
You're my witness, I'm your mutineer

I was born to rock the boat
Some may sink, but we will float
Grab your coat, let's get out of here
You're my witness, I'm your mutineer

Long ago we laughed at shadows
Lightning flashed, thunder followed
They could never fight us here
You're my witness, I'm your mutineer

I was born to rock the boat
Some may sink, but we will float
Grab your coat, let's get out of here
You're my witness, I'm your mutineer

Long ago we laughed at shadows
Lightning flashed, thunder followed
They could never fight us here
You're my witness, I'm your mutineer
