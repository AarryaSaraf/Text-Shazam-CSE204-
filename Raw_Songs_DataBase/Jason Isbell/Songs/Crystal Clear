Daylight's comin' in
I guess the blanket's gettin' thin
And every shadow on my skin's
A different shade

There's nobody here
I heard 'em call it Crystal Clear
When you get by yourself
And you're still wide awake

Stay away from that place
For your own sake

Manny's fast and cheap
His daughter never goes sleep
She lost thirty-seven pounds
In ninety days

He don't cook that much
He says he does it for the rush
And as for makin' money,
He's got other ways

Stay away from that place
For your own sake

Stay away from that place,
It ain't about somebody seein' you
And it really don't matter
If he helps you pay the bills

If they take your kids away,
You know you don't need 'em
If you ever get 'em back,
You'll prob'ly get 'em both killed

Summer went too fast I think
As I lay off the gas
And I roll onto Manny's Street
And smell the flames

Big red truck sits still
And all the water looks surreal
And I think, Manny's had the skill
But not the brains

Should've stayed away from that place
Now it's too late

Stay away from that place,
It ain't about somebody seein' you
And it ain't about havin' your name
On the Sheriff's list

Well I told you, one day
You'd burn down the whole avenue
I thought your mama raised you
Better than this

Manny's in the ground
Oh man, he burned that trailer down
Nobody gave a good goddamn
About him or his

Baby's in the dirt
She finally fit into that old skirt
But I guess that don't make much difference
After this

She should've stayed away from that place
Boy, I'm glad I did

Stay away from that place,
It ain't about somebody seein' you
And it ain't about havin' your name
On the Sheriff's list

Well I told you, one day
You'd burn down the whole avenue
I thought your mama raised you
Better than this
