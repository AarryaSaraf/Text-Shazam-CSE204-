What do I do to make you smile?
You been hurting for a while
What can I do to make you laugh?
Get St. Peter's autograph?

What's that distance in your eyes?
Has your faith been compromised?
What can I do to help you sleep?
I'll work hard and work for cheap

Sometimes it's nothing but the way you're wired
And that's not your fault
We're all struggling with the world on fire
And the fear we're taught

Now you've lost another friend
Who couldn't stay to see the end
He had somewhere else to be
Cut him down and burn the tree

There's no shelter from the rain
And I can't comprehend your pain
But I got arms and I got ears
And I will always be right here

Sometimes its nothing but the way you're raised
And that could have been worse
And I see you suffering through the best of days
Still you're putting me first

What do I do to let you know
That I'm not haunted by his ghost?
Let him dance around our room
Let him smell of your perfume

Share your best remember whens
If he comes through here again
Maybe he could make you laugh
Bring St. Peter's autograph
