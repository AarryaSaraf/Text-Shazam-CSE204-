I knew this lady from Tennessee
Moved to California, didn't stay with me.
Just packed a bag and left with me passed out.
Never could believe a word that come from her mouth.

She told me once, drunk on wine.
She'd be beside me 'till the end of time.
But the end of time came early at my house.
Never could believe a word that come from her mouth.

There weren't no truth in a word that lil' girl said.
Only time she didn't lie to me was rolling in the big old bed.

She worked real hard every day
But old fame and fortune never came her way
It just slid on by like springtime in the south.
Never could believe a word that come from her mouth.

She came back home on a Trailways bus.
Stole a pack of Camels for the both of us.
She crawled right up to the front door of my house.
Never could believe a word that comes from her mouth.

There weren't no truth in a word that lil' girl said.
Only time she didn't lie to me was rolling in the big old bed.

I knew this lady from Tennessee
Moved to California, didn't stay with me.
Just packed a bag and left with me passed out.
I never could believe a word that come from her mouth.
