Pain from pearls, hey little girl
How much have you grown?
Pain from pearls, hey little girl
Flowers for the ones you've known

Are you on fire from the years?
What would you give for your kid fears?

Secret staircase running high
You had a hiding place
Secret staircase running low
But they all know now you're inside

Are you on fire from the years?
What would you give for your kid fears?
Your kid fears

Skipping stones, we know the price now
Any sin will do
How much further, if you can spin?
How much further, if you are smooth?

Are you on fire from the years?
From the years?
What would you give for your kid fears?
What would replace the rent with the stars above?
Replace the need with love
Replace the anger with the tide
Replace the ones, the ones, the ones that you love
The ones that you love

Are you on fire?
Replace the rent with the stars above
Are you on fire from all the years?
Replace the need with love
Replace the anger with the tide
What would you give for your kid fears?
Are you on fire?
Replace the rent with the stars above
Are you on fire from all the years?
Replace the need with love
What would you give for your kid fears?
What would you give for your kid fears?
What would you give for your kid fears?
Your kid fears
