To lessen my troubles
I stopped hanging out with vultures
And empty saviors like you
Well, I wish I had a nickel
For every miracle
That you easily tricked me into

Well, you can lead a horse to water
But faith is another matter
So don't you surrender
'Cause sometimes salvation
In the eye of the storm
Sister, do you even wanna try and find me?

I've no time for accusations
Or conversations
On all the bad, bad things that you do
Just a note from your jailor
On drugs and their relations
To all the people around you

And you can lead a horse to water
Oh, but faith is another matter
So don't you surrender
'Cause sometimes salvation
In the eye of the storm
Oh sister, do you wanna try to find me?

I've kept secret your superstitions
And all its twisted wisdom
That I fell right into

And you can lead a horse to water
Oh, but faith is another matter
So don't you surrender, don't you surrender
'Cause sometimes salvation
Sometimes salvation
Sometimes salvation
Sometimes salvation
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
Sister, do you even wanna try and find me?
Sister, do you even wanna try to find me?
