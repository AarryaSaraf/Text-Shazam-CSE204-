All the snow has turned to water
Christmas days have come and gone
Broken toys and faded color
Are all that's left to linger on

Well, I hate graveyards and old pawn shops
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they robbed me
Of my childhood souvenirs

Memories, they can't be bought
And they can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me

Broken hearts and dirty windows
Make life difficult to see
That's why last night and this morning
They always look the same to me

Well, I hate reading old love letters
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they robbed me
Of my sweetheart's souvenirs

Memories, they can't be bought
And they can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me

Memories, they can't be bought
And they can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me
