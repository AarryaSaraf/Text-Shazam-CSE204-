On the brand new moon
When you stumbled around in a tree
Just sit in your room
Smoking menthol's and hugging your knees

Smile
Until you remember how evening fell
Smile
Until you don't need to control yourself

When the light goes on
Will you stand in the mirror for me?
Put your best shirt on
There's someone important to see

Smile
Smile like your heart can be broken still
Smile
Somebody needs you and always will, they always will

Remind yourself there's nobody watching
Remind yourself there's nobody watching

Smile
Smile like you've been here a thousand times
Smile
Like words in your heart and your memory rhyme

Remind yourself there's nobody watching
Remind yourself there's nobody watching
Remind yourself there's nobody watching
