Well I've tried to open up my window and let the light come in
I step outside in the middle of the morning and in the evening again
Yes I've tried to be grateful for my devils and call them by their names
But I'm tired and by the middle of the morning I need someone to blame

I know you're scared of me, I can see it in your face
I can feel it in the way you move around this place
I know you're scared of me, I can see it in your smile
Like an unattended child you can't quite trust

But I'm tired of stepping on your shadow and feeling in the way
Yes I'm tired and by the middle of the morning I'm out of shit to say

I ain't used to this, seeing everybody's hand
I was raised to be a strong and silent southern man
I ain't used to this, a thousand days alone
In my bed or in my head or in my phone

Yes I'm tired of living in the moment and sleeping through the dream
I step outside in the middle of the morning and the roses hear the scream

I know you're scared of me, so I never get too close
I just sit here on the tailgate like a farm hand's ghost
Watch the roses bloom, watch them wilt away and die
'Til I notice I've been crying this whole time

Well I've tried to open up my window and let the light come in
I step outside in the middle of the morning and in the evening again
