You said you heard of me, so why are you so afraid?

some minor changes made, you missed the big parade
another filthy day, another Hollywood sign
you missed the caution line, and you just walked right in.
YOU WALKED RIGHT IN
there's somebody here, somebody you once knew
you took a liking to, your conversation cues
the way you cut your hair, the time you did it yourself
you're like a hired help, the way you fit right in
THE WAY YOU FIT RIGHT IN

'CAUSE YOU'RE A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS
YOU'RE A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS
YOU'RE THE SAME OLD STUBBORN WAITRESS, BABY
YOU'RE A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS

you swim the the other way, you put your seat upstream
so many hopes and dreams, so many in betweens
your new reality, just make yourself at home
he's always watchin' me, he' never been alone
SO YOU JUST WALKED RIGHT IN

'CAUSE YOU'RE A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS
YOU'RE A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS
YOU'RE THE SAME OLD STUBBORN WAITRESS, BABY
YOU'RE A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS

you met that greasy guy, I don't care what you did
in 1965, before the wife and kid
I'll leave my jacket on, so sorry I can't stay
just put the piece away.
just put the piece away, let me call a cab
we'll go our separate ways, we'll go our separate ways
just put the piece away, I don't care what you did
back in younger days, just put the piece away
PUT IT AWAY

'CAUSE YOU'RE A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS
YOU'RE A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS
YOU'RE THE SAME OLD STUBBORN WAITRESS, BABY
YOU'RE A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS

'CAUSE I'M A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS
I'M A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS
I'M THE SAME OLD STUBBORN WAITRESS, BABY
I'M A BRAND NEW KIND OF ACTRESS
