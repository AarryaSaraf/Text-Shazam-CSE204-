You can't make a woman sleep alone
You can't make a woman sleep alone
You can't give her lovin' on the phone
You can't make her stay her ass at home

But you try, don't you?
You try, don't you?
Just want to die, don't you
When she runs?

You can't tell her nothing she don't know
You can't tell her nothing she don't know
She'll chop down every living thing you grow
But you can't take her with you when you go

But you try, don't you?
You try, don't you?
Just want to die, don't you,
When she runs?

Take a year and go back home
Where the wind comes sweepin'
Through the plains
You ain't seen her in awhile,
But she loves you just the same

You can't stop that ringin' in your ear
You can't stop that ringin' in your ear
You can't make the highway disappear
You can't make her love you out of fear

But you try, don't you?
You try, don't you?
Just want to die, don't you,
When she runs?

Take a year and go back home
Where the wind comes sweepin'
Through the plains
You ain't seen her in awhile
But she loves you just the same
