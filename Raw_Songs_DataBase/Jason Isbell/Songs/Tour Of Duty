I'm arriving on the day's last train.
Stepping on the platform, trying to see you through the rain.
I don't know the ways you've changed since I left,
And I really don't care.
I've done my tour of duty now I'm home and I ain't going anywhere.

I taught myself to tolerate the pain,
All the loneliness and boredom and the work I did in vain.
All the work we did in vain. Now I'm not the same as I was.
I've done my tour of duty now I'll try to do what a civilian does.

I promise not to bore you with my stories.
I promise not to scare you with my tears.
I never would exaggerate the glory.
I'll seem so satisfied here.

I've been eating like I'm out on bail.
Collard greens and chicken wings and oysters by the pail.
Eating oysters by the pail, making up for those lost days.
I've done my tour of duty now I'm going to put you in the family way.

We'll laugh like little children telling secrets.
Probably cry like old women drinking gin,
Because I've done my tour of duty now I'm home
And I ain't leaving here again.

I've done my tour of duty now I'm home and I ain't leaving here again.
