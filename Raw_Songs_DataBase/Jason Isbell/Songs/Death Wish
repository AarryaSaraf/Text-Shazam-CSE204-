Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes like flipping off a light switch
Everybody dies but you gotta find a reason to carry on

Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you, baby, but I won't leave you alone

The night was young once, we were the wild ones
Before we had to pay attention to the violence
Anything could happen but nothing ever really did
I wanted action, she wanted answers
Sunrise with the dealers and the dancers
It takes a whole lot of medicine to feel like a little kid

Oh, and did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes like flipping off a light switch
Everybody dies but you gotta find a reason to carry on

Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you, baby, but I won't leave you alone

Who's gonna save you? Who's left to pray to?
What's the difference in a breakdown and a breakthrough?
I saw her in the moonlight digging up the garden bed
I want to hold her until it's over
Let her sleep through the morning on my shoulder
But there's nothin' I could say to her that I ain't already said

Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes like flipping off a light switch
Everybody dies but you gotta find a reason to carry on

Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you, baby, but I won't leave you alone

When your words mean nothing
When the world turns to monochrome
And you know she's not bluffing
'Cause you feel it in your bones
You feel it in your bones

Oh, and did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes like flipping off a light switch
Everybody dies but you gotta find a reason to carry on

Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you, baby, but I won't leave you alone

I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Oh, I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
I wanna hold her, I wanna hold her
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?

I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Oh, I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
