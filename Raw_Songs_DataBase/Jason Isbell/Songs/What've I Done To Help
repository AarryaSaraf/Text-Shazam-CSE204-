Thought I was alone in the world
Until my memories gathered 'round me in the night
Thought I was strong
Until I finally had to fight

I kept my head down
And showed up to work on time and watched my appetite
Put the money in the mattress
Lock the doors at night, and we'd all be alright

See I've made mistakes that I can't erase
Some of the love I've lost will not come back to me
I broke my word, I lied on a Bible
Just to feel a little free

She didn't deserve it; nobody ever deserves it
But I cut anchor and I drifted out to sea
And you found me busted and somehow you trusted
I was not what I could be

Climb to safety, you and me and the baby
Send our thoughts and prayers to loved ones on the ground
And as the days went by
We just stopped looking down, down, down

The world's on fire and we just climb higher
Till we're no longer bothered by the smoke and sound
Good people suffer and the heart gets tougher
Nothing given, nothing found
