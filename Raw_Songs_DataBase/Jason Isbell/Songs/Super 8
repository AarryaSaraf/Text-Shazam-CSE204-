Don't wanna die in a Super 8 motel
Just because somebody's evening didn't go so well
If I ever get back to Bristol
I'm better off sleeping in the county jail
Don't wanna die in a Super 8 motel

Having such a sweet night audience was just right drinking like a pirate do
Don't wanna sleep yet buddy, it's a good bet, I'll raise more hell than you
Do a couple rails and chase your own tail and talk about the bad ole days
Tremor in a tee shirt telling me her heart hurt honey, let me count the ways
Then a big boy busted in, screaming at his girlfriend, waving 'round a fungo bat
Bass player stepping up brandishing a coffee cup he took it in the baby fat

I don't wanna die in a Super 8 motel
Just because somebody's evening didn't go so well
If I ever get back to Bristol
I'm better off sleeping in the county jail
I don't wanna die in a Super 8 motel

Well I finally got the room clear bleeding from my left ear feeling pretty bad for the maid
Lost a couple drinks and my dinner in the sink and I woke up with the bed still made
Wasn't quite morning I wasn't quite breathing my heart, way up in my throat
Girl starts screaming and the maid starts screaming and it looks like it's all she wrote
Well, they slapped me back to life and they telephoned my wife and they filled me full of Pedialyte
Saw my guts, saw my glory it would make a great story if I ever could remember it right

I don't wanna die in a Super 8 motel
Just because somebody's evening didn't go so well
If I ever get back to Bristol
I'm better off sleeping in the county jail
I don't wanna die in a Super 8 motel
I don't wanna die in a Super 8 motel
