Don't roll away that stone, girl
Leave it where it lay
You think he's coming home but you know it's not today
I think the road will break me and never fill the holes,
but every time I'm saved I stop beating out a soul

I'm too scared to ask the right questions
and too tired to fill the right shoes
so I'll take advantage of the blues
I'll take advantage of the blue

There really ain't no difference
in Michigan and Maine
If you ain't here to see this I'm missing just the same
Your skin as soft as water, same temperature as me
I'd never know I touched you if you didn't let me see

I'd crawl to meet you if you'd just stay there,
and finally have a thing I couldn't bear to lose
So I'll take advantage of the blues
I'll take advantage of the blue

Mark me up so they can see the best of me
Hold me down so I can't find a drink
Dance so I don't have to think
