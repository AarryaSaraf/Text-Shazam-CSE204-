See the man with the military mind
Trying to make us all afraid all the time
Trying to make us all stay inside and lock our doors and windows
See the man's got too much to count
Try to recollect the sermon on the mount
Blessed are the poor when they're all swinging from the gallows

I ain't afraid no more

However long the night, the dawn will break again
We'll be around when you have lost your oldest friends
There's nothing you can say or do to us to drown out this amen
'Cause however long the night, the dawn will break again

See the poet with nothing left to say
Staring down at blank pages all day
Let the alcohol take you away and sleep the way the fools do
See the beast with the gasoline hand
Breathing fire, drawing lines in the sand
Pray we find ourselves a better plan or die the way we used to

I ain't afraid no more

However long the night, the dawn will break again
We'll be around when they have found your next of kin
There's nothing you can do or say to us to drown out this amen
'Cause however long the night, the dawn will break again

See the woman with the roses in her hair
Bring me lovin' when it's too much bear
Tell me I can make a difference this time
All I gotta do is make it all rhyme

However long the night, the dawn will break again
We'll be around when they have found your next of kin
There's nothing you can do or say to us to drown out this amen
'Cause however long the night, the dawn will break again
