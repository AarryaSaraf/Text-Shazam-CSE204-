Forget everything I ever told you
I'm sure I lied way more than twice
But understand I am not Emily Post
You know I'm nowhere near that precise

And I struggle with these etiquettes like you wouldn't believe
I'm puzzled by the policy
'Cause after everything else you draw out of me
You still expect cute curtsies

But I'm through, through, through
Carrying you on my shoulders
And I'm through, through, through
Hiding
I'm through, through, through
Living my life for you
Yes, I hope for both our sakes
I'm through, through, through

I hope you're happy now with your hold on me
It sure struck me awful strong
And don't you dare call this disloyalty
There's no way you could be more wrong

I'm just dragging my devotion in a last-ditch retreat
Seeking some safety
I'm tired of bleeding for no good reason
Is that so hard to see?

But I'm through, through, through
Carrying you on my shoulders
And I'm through, through, through
Hiding
I'm through, through, through
Living my life for you
Yes, I hope for both our sakes
I'm through, through, through
