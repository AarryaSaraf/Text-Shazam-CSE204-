Time between the glory days and the golden years
She did the work of 20 able men
Sent Tommy off to school to be an engineer
And Sarah went to try out all the sins

She took to taking tea out in the Belvedere
Bourbon in the evenings by the fire
As if the Great Depression never made it here
As if she had defeated her desire

She just wanted to ride in a Delahaye 135
She just wanted to ride in a Hudson Commodore
No need to worry anymore

A doctor then a lawyer then a Roosevelt
Tried to take her underneath their wing
She was in her 20's in the Bible Belt
Before she knew she didn't need a thing

She didn't need their pity on a single girl
She didn't need their help to raise the brood
She wouldn't be returning to her daddies world
She didn't want a better attitude

She just wanted to ride in a Delahaye 135
She just wanted to ride in a Hudson Commodore
No need to worry anymore

She just wanted to ride in a Delahaye 135
She just wanted to ride in a Hudson Commodore
No need to worry anymore
