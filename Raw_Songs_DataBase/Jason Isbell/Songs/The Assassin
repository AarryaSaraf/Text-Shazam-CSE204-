I used to be a killer, best killer in the land
Killed women and children just as easy as a man
I rolled their mangled bodies nonchalantly out the door
But now I've lost my taste for killin' anymore

Made me lots of money, was the best at my job
I never had to nine-to-five or cheat or steal or rob
Just load up my guns and leave 'em on the floor
But I ain't got the stomach for killing anymore

Somethin' must be done
But I've done all that I can do
What good is an assassin
Who just can't follow through?

She took me in her arms when no one else would have me
Taught me how to throw the blade 
Taught me how to shoot so straight without a moment's 
She was the most beautiful thing that I have ever killed

Somethin' must be done
But I've done all that I can do
What good is an assassin
Who just can't follow through?

Somethin' must be done
But I've done all that I can do
What good is an assassin
Who just can't follow through?
Who just can't follow through
