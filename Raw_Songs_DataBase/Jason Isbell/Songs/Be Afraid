We've been testing you
And you failed
To see how long that you could sit with the truth but you bailed

I don't think you'd even recognize the loss of control
And I don't think you even see it in yourself
See every one of us is counting dice that we didn't roll
And the loser is the last to ask for help

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

The stage belongs to you
And you feel like a star
And you can bark and snap like a dog at the man who just tuned your guitar
And I don't think you'd even recognize a kid in the wings
And I don't think you even see her in yourself
She looks to you for what to do with all her delicate dreams
But you're too terrified to be of any help

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

We don't take requests
We won't shut up and sing
Tell the truth enough you'll find it rhymes with everything

We've been testing you
And you failed
To see how long that you could hold it in before you screamed
But you only exhaled
And I don't think you even recognize the sound of your voice
When it's blasting through the speakers in the sky
And if your words add up to nothing 
Then you're making a choice to sing a cover when you need a battle cry

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway
