Are you lonely tonight?
Are you out on the road?
I'm headed home to go it alone again.
Are you dreaming out loud?
Scared of the crowds?
I'm headed home to go it alone again.

It's realizing just how close you've come to death.
and rearranging accordingly.
I'm realizing what I've lost and what I've left
and taking it home to go it alone again.

Find me a place
With salt on the roads
I'll do what I'm told, and buy what I'm sold again.
She was enough
but that was never enough.
The wound that won't heal
is pain I can't feel again.

In real life these things don't happen much at all.
Too bad we all live the dream.
I'm realizing just how far I had to fall
and taking it home to go it alone again.

I'm taking it home to go it alone again.
Taking it home to go it alone again.
