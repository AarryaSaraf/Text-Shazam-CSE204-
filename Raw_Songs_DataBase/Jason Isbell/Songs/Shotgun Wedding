Ten years out of high school, still no idea what to do.
You took him home from a nightclub. He took a nightclub to you.
Now I watch from the window, too guilty to scream.
My feet are like steel. I might be in a dream.

Every time I see you, you look bigger than you did the day before.
Even though I know it's not my fault, I wish it was.
I can only ride the elevator all night long from floor to floor
and I can only stand outside your window in the dust.

So how about a shotgun wedding? What about your dignity?
What about a different setting? What about me?
All your daddy's wishes honored, all of that security...
How about a shotgun wedding? What about me?

I guess I'm a loner. Some call me a freak.
I saw you in the hallway, too guilty to speak.
Now I sleep in the daytime and I sleep on the floor.
I dial your number and I knock on your door.

Every time I hear your voice or footsteps I get frozen in one place
and I have to struggle for the courage just to run.
I can see the eyes of all the ones that left you glowing in your face
and I just want to help you with this life that you've begun.

So how about a shotgun wedding? What about your dignity?
What about a different setting? What about me?
All your daddy's wishes honored, all of that security...
How about a shotgun wedding? What about me?
How about a shotgun wedding? What about me?
