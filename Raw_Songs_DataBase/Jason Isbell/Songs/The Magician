You watch every move
and call it slight of hand
you know it's what I do
but never who I am, never who I am

started on the street
cards and dollar bills
shuffling my feet
never could be still, never could be still

and I am an orphan man but ain't we all
I can make myself disappear
I am an orphan man but ain't we all
I could be somewhere worse than here

I had a bride
sawed her in half
couple people cried
but most of them just laughed, most of them just laughed

and I had a son
strong of hand and will
taught him how to run
but never how to steal, never how to steal

I am an orphan man but ain't we all
I can't make myself reappear
I am an orphan man but ain't we all
I hope there's somewhere worse than here

I was called amazing
I make folks believe
With nothing in my pockets
And nothing up my sleeve

I am an orphan man but ain't we all
I can make myself disappear
I am an orphan man but ain't we all
and I know there's somewhere worse than here
worse than here
worse than here
