Feel the southern breezes and the southern wind
Blowing down around the corner bend
D'Agostino's late last night
I saw a boy, fifteen, the road
With nothing in his pockets, his hands to the sky
And nowhere else to go

Can you see it or believe it?
he's never been
So come with me I'll show you
Where the dogwoods bloom, it's true
Lost and found and lost again
To the Honeysuckle Blue

Runnin' through these caverns of gold
Runs a river of death indeed
An old hotel serves as a shelter
For children of the street
Abandoned by the promised land
Set sail on their own
How much longer will the well
Be dry for those who roam?

I got a ticket in my pocket
To send the corner man he's never been
Have you ever seen the Blue Ridge Mountains, boy?
Or the Chattahoochee or the Honeysuckle Blue?



Lost and found and lost again
To the Honeysuckle Blue
