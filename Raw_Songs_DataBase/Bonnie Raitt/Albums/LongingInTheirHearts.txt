Album: LongingInTheirHearts

// Love Sneakin' Up On You //

Rainy night, I'm all alone
Sittin' here, waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns to cold, cold sweat
Thinkin' about things we ain't done yet
Tell me now
I gotta know, do you feel the same
Do you just light up at the mention of my name

[Chorus:]
Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
And if your whole world is shakin', feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Hey, hey yeah

Nowhere on Earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneakin' up on your blind side
You might as well try to stop the rain
Stand in the track of a runaway train
Just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be, yeah
Come on, let's finish what you started with me
Yeah

[Chorus]

Hey yeah

[Chorus 2x]

// Longing In Their Hearts //

Let me tell you 'bout a friend of mine
He's a short order cook
Long on speed, short on spice
He reads his customers like a book
He's seen this, and he's done that
Now he's makin' fried eggs an art
But there's one thing he can't fix no how
There's a longing in his heart
He's tried for years to work it out
At the grill and at his home
Well he talks to his friends, talks to himself
He talks the chicken right off the bone
Talks to his woman and she understands
You know they're always eye to eye
She runs the join, They live out back
Small House under a Big sky
Well even the stars at night agree
The sky is falling apart
She knows cause she can feel it too
There's a longing in her heart
A longing in her heart
Longing in her heart
Well now you and me, we're just like them
We never wanted to be alone,
So we made a pact, sealed with desire
For a happier house and home
Only to find it doens't untie
The know where feelings die
There's a longing deep inside our hearts
And no one to tell us why
Our friends aren't looking for anything new
They wouldn't know where to look
Well her, she like running the joint
And he likes being a cook
Together they're doing very well
They're might glad they could
But there's a fire burning towards them now
Coming from a distant wood
And eve the stars at night agree
That the sky is falling apart
We know 'cause we can feel it too
There's a longing in our hearts

// You //

Nobody else could make me happy
No one could hurt me like you do
You were the only one That mattered

Then you were gone...Love had moved on
Left me alone thinking of...

You...There was never any other
You...and I were created to be true

Isn't it Love that keeps us breathing
Isn't it love we're sent here for
Wasn't that love that we were feeling
(That was something baby)

Deep in our soul...Deeper than we know
Keeping me holding out for

You...There was never any question
You'll be forever on my mind

You and I, we were meant to be together
True hearts in a world where love is dyin'

And I might as well have been dyin' when
We were apart
When you came back I felt the beating of my heart

You...There was never any question
You'll be forever on my mind
You and I, we were meant to be together
You...and only you

It was you...only you
You...Always you

// Cool, Clear Water //

I want to feel my earth turn over,baby
In this hardened winter ground
Feel my earth turn over, darlin'
Till' I'm rootless and unbound
I want to feel my body tremble
When there's no one else around
Just this cool, clear water runnin'
In this love that I've found

Hey baby
See how it can be
Every time you reveal yourself tome
I'll come runnin'

I want to feel myself go under,baby
Where the deepest river bleeds
I want to feel it pull me under,darlin'
Until it drops me to my knees
I want to know that I can findyou
When there's no more eyes tosee
In this cool, clear water runnin'
You'll come runnin' to me

Hey baby
All my life I have known there'ssomething more
A love to blind me like the sun
Deep in dreams, I will wash upon your shore
Now I know that you're the one

When I feelmy babycallin'
It's like awhisper inAnd whenthe softestrain is fallin', darlin'
I will crumble in your hand
And when all that's left is wonder
And no need to understand
Well this cool, clear waterrunnin'
Will be all that I am...

// Circle Dance //

I don't know why it should be so hard
Giving up this circle dance
Worn out steps from long ago
Don't give love a chance

It's a bitter heirloom handed down
These twisted parts we play
I'm not her and you're not him
It just comes out that way

Can't go back to make things right
Though I wish I understood
Time has made things clearer now
We did the best we could

I'll be home soon, that's what you'd say
And a little kid believes
After a while I learned that love
Must be a thing that leaves

I tried so hard just to hold you near
Was as good as I could be
Even when I had you here
You stayed so far from me

Can't go back to make things right
Though I wish I understood
Time has made things clearer noe
You did the best you could

Now that this has occured to me
I just want you to know
I've been too faithful all my life
It's time to let you go

// I Sho Do //

You took my love and ran away
What did you expect me to say
I gave you everything I could
But you weren't giving up, baby
What you should

I Sho do...Need You
I Sho Do...Want You

I'm in need of what you've got
It makes my blood boiling hot
You told me baby, A long time ago
That you'd never, ever leave me
Never, no more

I Sho Do...Need You
I Sho Do...Want You
I Sho Do...Wish For You
I Sho Do...Walk the Floor All Night Long

When you see me, baby standing alone
Come and help me baby, Cause I'm out on my own
You see it ain't easy in the streets
But what you've got baby, could help me to my feet

I Sho Do...Need You
I Sho Do...Want You
I Sho Do...Wish For You
I Sho Do...Walk the Floor All
Night Long

// Dimming Of The Day //

This old house is falling down around my ears
I'm drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
I need you at the dimming of the day

You pulled me like the moon
Pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant

I see you on the street and in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me

I'm living for the night we steal away
I need you at the dimming of the day
I need you at the dimming of the day...

// Feeling Of Falling //

Sometimes I miss that feeling of falling
Falling on over the ledge
You know I miss that feeling of falling
Falling on over the ledge
And when my mind it gets to worryin'
And I just can't get no rest
Oh Baby, that's when I call you up instead

It's after midnight baby, I'm sittin' here all alone
I tried to call your number baby,
But you weren't at home
I been a good girl baby, through with all that mess
But the way I'm feelin' now, darlin'
Well it scares me half to death

Well I miss that feelin', of fallin'
On over the ledge

That summer night in Texas, baby
Too hot and wet to sleep
I heard you pull up in the distance
You're comin' to get me relief
We went screamin' down the highway, baby
So much faster than we should
You pulled me over in the moonlight
Man, I still can feel that hood

Well I miss that feeling of fallin',
On over the ledge
When that rain starts baby, I want to take a real
Good look at that ledge

It ain't something you get over
You might think you made it through
You can turn your head and walk away
But it never takes it's eyes off you

It'll push your foot right through the floorboard
Make you cut them streamers down his back
You waste what's precious and you can't afford
It runs your life right off the track

Keeps you boilin' in that poison
Only the truly twisted know so well
You don't need drugs to show you heaven, baby
'cause there's plenty clean in hell

That miss that feelin' of fallin'
Of fallin' on over the ledge

When the blues start callin' I want to crawl way up close to the ledge

// Steal Your Heart Away //

I know you got a different picture in mind
Some dream a world of a different kind
I know this rhythm we've been moving to is way to slow
Each time our bodies are supposed to meet
I'm still here missing a beat
And when I look at you in your eyes
We're still dancing to a differernt tune

[Chorus:]
Take me to your dreaming place
Open up my eyes
Let me see what it takes to be
Your lover in disguise
Show me how I do those things
That make you want to stay
'Cause I'll go crazy if I don't find
The words I gotta say
To steal your heart away

I'll buy you diamonds, buy you golden rings
All kinds of beautiful things
But that don't matter to a lover with a restless heart
Cause you still want to wake up to a different scene
Some screen gem like the one in the dream
And leave me standing like a fool in the wings
Still waiting for a part to play

[Chorus]

I know you think she's right for you
That she's in tune with what you do
That she can touch you deep inside
Where all your deepest feelings lie
But I got something you should know
Before she starts to hurt you so
You can bet your life she's gonna hurt you

And maybe you think that it's alright
To leave me waiting every night
To put me down in company
In front of everyone we see
To take my loving when it's free
And then to throw it back at me

Well baby, I just can't stand it
Cause I can be the one for you
And I can make your dreams come true
And I can love you like she can
Cause fancy clothes don't make no woman
Believe me baby
I got what it takes to make you feel

And maybe you think a girl should be
As perfect as a girl can be
To love you when your feeling down
And miss you when you're not around
Well I can't be that one for you
I can only be the one that loves you

Hey, what's this on your mind
Hey, what's this change of mind
Hey, what's this on your mind

// Storm Warning //

Storm warning, feels like a heavy rain
Winds on the coast tonight
We may get tossed tonight
Storm warning, he made it pretty plain
He's fallin' for another, found a new lover
(and he won't be back again)
Can't stop a river, when it's burst it's banks
I've seen the look in his eyes
He's in love and hypnotized
Time of mourning
There's already been a flood of my tears
Such a sense of loss tonight
Nought to do but ride it out
Can't stop a river when it's burst it's banks
I wonder how long it's gonna take
To get over this heartbreak
Storm warning, feels like a heavy rain
Winds on the coast tonight
We may get tossed tonight

// Hell To Pay //

Hey mister, we want you to know
We think you've taken this about as far as it can go
It's about to blow
You got nowhere to run
Why don't you sit back and watch the show

Used to drop your little darlin' off at Sunday School
Family values while you're gettin' some Behind the pool
She's nobody's fool
So don't be actin' surprised when your daughter
Wants it bad as you

You jack up the rent, you call in a loan
Clear your intent is to screw 'em out of all they own
Throw the dog a bone
Well you'll be cryin' for mercy when your karma
Calls you On the Phone

Times are hard...Ain't it a bitch
Japanese are makin' you twitch
All your investments are turnin' sour
Kinda spoils your happy hour

Look around, we're comin' your way
It's a wonder to us how you ever thought you'd
Get away
What you say
Well, the way it looks from here
You won't have to wait
The way it looks from here

No need to hesitate
Have a party celebrate
The way it looks from here
You won't have to wait for hell to pay....

// Shadow Of Doubt //

Just another homesick child
Tired of running wild
Ready to stand trial and move on
Though I'm guilty in your sight
Have some mercy tonight
I can't make it through the fight alone

Oh but lord, no don't make it easy
Keep me working till I work it on out
Just please shine enought light on me
Til I'm free from this shadow of doubt
Keep me out of the Shadow of Doubt
As I try to make some sense
Of this world I'm up against
Well I know my best defense is your love
When the struggle gets insane
And the lesson's full of pain
Keep me calling out your name with Love

Oh but lord, no don't make it easy
Keep me workin' till I work it on out
Just please won't you shine
Enough light on me
Til I'm free from this shadow of Doubt

Well I whisper in the dark
From the bottom of my heart
And I'm searchin for one star to shine
I will shout from mountain high
And I'll reach into the sky
Til you open up my eyes so blind

Oh but lord no, Don't make it easy
Keep me workin' til I work it on out
Just please, please shine enough light on me
'Til I'm free from this shadow of doubt
Keep me out of the Shadow...
