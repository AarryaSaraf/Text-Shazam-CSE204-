// Darlin' //

Darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome
I'd call you on the phone some
But I don't have dime

Darlin', you're so far behind me
Tomorrow is gonna find me
Further down the line
Take a piece of paper
A pencil in my hand
I'm gonna write

Darlin', I know I feel the cold nights
Thinking of the old nights
Spent alone with you

Darlin', tears are in my eyes now
Know that I should try now
To make it back to you

Darlin', I love you more than ever
I wish we were together
Darlin' mine

Darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome
I'd call you on the phone some
But I don't have a dime

Darlin', you're so far behind me
Tomorrow's gonna find me
Further down the line

Darlin', tears are in my eyes (oh, in my eyes)
You that I should try now (I should try to make it back to you)
To make it back to you

// Feels Like Home //

Something in your eyes, makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself, in your arms
There's something in your voice, makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how low I've felt so long
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done

Feels like home to me, feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me, feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm all right, 'cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see through the dark there's light
If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you knew how happy you are making me
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much

Feels like home to me, feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me, feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

// It's All Over Now, Baby Blue //

Well, you must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Well, the highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Well, all your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty-handed armies, all going home
Your lover just walked out your door
Has taken all her blankets from your floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Well, leave your stepping stone behind, something calls to you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
Well, the vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Well, strike another match, go start anew
Oh, it's all over now, Baby Blue

Baby Blue

// Once In A Lifetime //

All my life, I tried to find someone to love me
And though the night is lonely when no one's there to hold me
I'd rather be alone than be without you
'Cause no one else will do

And just once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love like you
And nobody else will do

All my days are spent this way no one to talk to
And oh, the rain keeps fallin' and I hear your voice keep on callin'
I'd rather be alone then be without you
'Cause no one else will do

And once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love like you
And nobody else will do

Once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love like you
And nobody else will do

Once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love like you
And nobody else will do

Nobody else will do

// Richland Woman Blues //

Gimme red lipstick and a bright purple rouge
A shingle bob and a shot of good booze
Now hurry home, sweet baby, you come blow your horn
If you come too late, your mama will be gone

Come along young man, everything settin' right
My husband's goin' away till next Saturday night
Now hurry home, sweet baby, you come blow your horn
If you come too late, your mama will be gone

Well, I'm raring to go, pink toes on my feet
My mind is sittin' right for a Tin Lizzie seat
Now hurry home, sweet baby, come blow your horn
You come too late, your mama will be gone

Well, the skirts cut high, the dresses cut low
But you call me a sport, just watch me go
Now hurry home, sweet baby, come blow your horn
You come too late, your mama will be gone

Red rooster said, "Cockle doodle do do"
The rich woman said, "Any dude will do"
Now hurry home, sweet baby, you come blow your horn
You come too late, your mama will be gone

// Stayed Too Long At The Fair //

Jesus cried, wept and died
I guess he went up to heaven
I've been downtown such a long, long time
I'll never make it home by seven
Won't you come and take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And, lord, I just can't stand it anymore

Well I went down to Chason's
Walked 'til my feet got sore
I never knew what laughin' was
'Til you walked out the door
Won't you come and take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And, lord, I just can't stand it anymore

Well, you can give my soul to Abraham
Give my soul to Saul
Give my bones to Canada
My feet they don't hurt at all

I don't know who made the highway
I guess that's just my pride
But I have heard the prince of darkness
On his charger ride

The silver blade is gleamin'
The scales are in his hands
I swear another night is fallin'
Don't you lose another man
Won't you come and take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And, lord, I just can't stand it anymore

// Will The Sun Ever Shine Again //

Rain is pourin' down like the
Heavens are hurtin'.
Seems like it's been dark since
The devil knows when.
How do you go on, never knowin'
For certain,
Will the sun ever shine again?

Feels like it's been years since
It started to thunder.
Clouds are campin' out in the valley
And glen.
How do you go on, when you can't help
But wonder.
Will the sun ever shine again?

What if the rain keeps fallin'?
What if the sky stays gray?
What if the winds keep squallin',
And never go away?

Maybe soon the storm will be
Tired of blowin'.
Maybe soon it all will be over, amen.
How do you go on, if there's no way
Of knowin'?
Will the sun ever shine?
Wish I could say.
Send me a sign-
One little ray.
Lord, if you're list'nin', how long
Until then?
Will the sun ever shine again?

I see a love that money, just can't buy
One look, from you, I drift, away
I pray, that you, are here, to stay
