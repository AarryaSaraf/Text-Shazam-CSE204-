// Nick Of Time //

A friend of mine, she cries at night
And she calls me on the phone
Sees babies everywhere she goes
And she wants one of her own

She's waited long enough she says
And still he can't decide
Pretty soon she'll have to choose
And it tears her up inside

She is scared,
Scared to run out of time

I see my folks are getting on
And I watch their bodies change
I know they see the same in me
And it makes us both feel strange

No matter how you tell yourself
It's what we all go through
Those lines are pretty hard to take
When they're staring back at you

Oh Oh Oh, scared you'll run out of time

When did the choices get so hard
With so much more at stake
Life gets mighty precious
When there's less of it to wa-a-a-aste

Mmm-m-m-m-m-m

Mmmmmmm, scared you'll run out of time

Just when I thought I'd had enough
And all my tears were shed
No promise left unbroken
There were no painful words unsaid

Yo-o-o-u came along and showed me
I could leave it all behind
You opened up my heart again
And then much to my surprise

I found love, baby, love in the nick of time
(Love in the nick of time)
I found love darlin', love in the nick of time
(Love in the nick of time)
I found love baby, love in the nick of time

Ooooooo-ooo-ooo-whoo-ooo
Yeah baby

Uhhhhh-huh-uh

Found love...
In the nick of time...

Thought I'd given up...
Given up baby...

Oh ooo wo ooo wo...

// Thing Called Love //

Don't have to humble yourself to me,
I ain't your judge or your king
Baby, you know I ain't no queen of sheba
We may not even have our dignity,
This could be just a powerful thing
Baby we can choose you know we ain't no amoeba

Are you ready for the thing called love
Don't come from me and you,
It comes from up above
I ain't no porcupine,
Take off your kid gloves
Are you ready for the thing called love
I ain't some icon carved out of soap
Sent here to clean up your reputation
Baby, you know you ain't no prince charming
We can live in fear or act out of hope
For some kind of peaceful situation
Baby, how come the cry of love is so alarming

Ugly ducklings don't turn into swans
And glide off down the lake
Whether your sunglasses are off or on
You only see the world you make

Are you ready for the thing called love
Don't come from me and you,
It comes from up above
I ain't no porcupine,
Take off your kid gloves

Are you ready for it
Are you ready for the thing called love
Don't come from me and you,
It comes from up above
I ain't no porcupine,
Take off your kid gloves

Are you ready for it
Are you ready for love, baby
Oooh yeah babe
Are you ready for love

// Love Letter //

Sittin' in front of your house,
Like rain in early dawn
Workin' on a love letter
Got my radio on.

Got my eye on your window pane
And I smoked a lot of cigarettes.
Mercy, mercy but love is strange
And you haven't even kissed me yet.

[Chorus:]
Look comes to push,
Push comes to shove,
Shove comes to touch,
Touch will come to love.

Workin' on a love letter,
Listenin' to a love song,
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter,
Got my radio on...radio, radio

Hope you get the message baby.
I know that you're gonna let me in.
It's real in your neighborhood
And this is more than I'm gonna bend.

[Chorus]

Why don't sit waitin'
Why don't behavin'
Love's waiting in the car,
In the car and rain now.

Workin' on a love letter,
Listenin' to a love song,
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter,
Got my radio on...radio, radio

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]

[3 times with adlibs:]
Workin' on a love letter,
Listenin' to a love song,
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter,
Got my radio on...radio, radio

// Cry On My Shoulder //

I know it's hard sometimes
And things seem larger than they are
But if you need to tell someone
That's what I'm here for

Cry on my shoulder
I'll help you rise above
Cry on my shoulder, my love

Out in the world outside
It can be harsh and cold
But if you need someone
I will be here to hold you

Cry on my shoulder
I'll help you dry your eyes
Cry on my shoulder, my love

I know it's hard sometimes
And things seem larger than they are
But if you need to let it go
Then you can call on me

Cry on my shoulder
I'll help you dry your eyes
Cry on my shoulder, my love
Cry on my shoulder
I'll help you rise above
Cry on my shoulder, my love
My love...

// Real Man //

Dont want no secret agent
Dont need no long cadillac
Dont want nobody with no problems
I don't need a man with a monkey on his back
I need a real man
I said a real man
I need a real man

Aint messing with no toy
I don't need no baby boy
Dont need to send me no flowers babe
Sending flowers is real nice
Way I've been feeling my hearts been a-reeling
I need a man that loves me once
I want a man that loves me twice
Its a sticky situation babe
Keep me up late at night
Honey don't know the difference
Wanna go left when you shoulda gone right
I want a real man
I said a real man
I want a real man
I've been around the world
I'm a woman not a girl

I don't want no million dollers
I don't need no diamond ring
You can twist and shout
For to knock yourself out
I don't care about material things
I want a real man
I need a real man
I want a real man
I said a real man
I want a real man
I need a real man baby
I want a real man
I want a real man
Real man
Real man
Aint messing with no toy
Dont need no baby boy
I been around the world
Im a woman not a girl
I want a real man
Real man

// Nobody's Girl //

She don't need anybody to tell her she's pretty.
She's heard it every single day of her life.
He's got to wonder what she sees in him
When there's so many others standing in line.

She gives herself to him, but he's still on the other side.
She's alone in this world, She's nobody's girl.
She's nobody's girl.

She shows up at this doorstep in the middle of the night,
Then she disappears for weeks at a time.
Just enough to keep him wanting more
But never is he satisfied.

And he's left to pick up the pieces, wondering what does he do this for.
She's off in her own little world, She's nobody's girl.
She's nobody's girl.

He said "Before I met her, I didn't love nothin.'
I could take it or leave it, that was okay, but
She brings out a want in me
For things I didn't even know that I need."

She does anything she wants, anytime she wants to,
With anyone. You know, she wants it all.
Still she gets all upset over the least little thing,
When you hurt her, it makes you feel so small.

And she's a walking contradiction,
But I ache for her inside.
She's fragile like a string of pearls.
She's nobody's girl.

She's fragile like a string of pearls.
She's nobody's girl.
She's nobody's girl.
She's nobody's girl.

// Have A Heart //

Hey!
Shut up.
Don't lie to me.
You think I'm blind but I got eyes to see
Hey!
Mister, how do you do.
Oh pardon me I thought I knew you.
Would you stand back baby 'cause I want to get a better look.
The big man who couldn't handle the little bit of love you took.

Hey, hey, have a heart, hey, have a heart.
If you don't love me, why don't you let me go?
Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?
Little by little you fade while I fall apart.

Oh Oh Oh darling, I love you so.
I told you yes, and then you told me no.
Baby, how can you say
You should be free and I should pay and pay
And you talk and talk about you and what you need
But sooner or later your love is gonna make me bleed.

Hey, hey, have a heart, hey, have a heart.
If you don't love me, why don't you let me go?
Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?
Little by little you fade while I fall apart.
Oh, Oh.

Talk on, talk on, but love is what you need.
And sooner or later that love is gonna make you bleed.

Hey, hey, have a heart, hey, have a heart.
If you don't love me, why don't you let me go?
Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?
Little by little you fade while I fall apart.
Don't ya know it baby
Have a heart
(please)
Hey Hey Have a heart
(please)
Have a heart

// Too Soon To Tell //

So now there's somebody new
These dreams I've been dreaming
Have all fallen through
You say I'll be fine
It only takes time
Someday,
That may be true
But it's too soon to tell
Ah, it's too soon to say
Maybe some day I'll be able,
To wish you well
But right now it's just,
Too soon to tell

It's all for the best
So you say
You never intended,
To hurt me this way
You want to hear
I won't drown in my tears
Well, baby the best that I can say
Is it's too soon to tell
Ah, it's too soon to say
Maybe some day I'll be able
To wish you well
But right now,
It's just too soon to tell
Well right now
It's just too soon to tell

Ooh............
Too soon to tell....

// I Will Not Be Denied //

A true love story
Is hard to find
Can't get no rest
Got no peace of mind
You say you gave
Your heart to me
You put me down
You set me free
You said you're deadly
Everybody said you was deadly
I guess you know he is because
Deadly
Comes in every shape and size
Deadly
Always takes you by surprise
There you was
The only one
Coming on me and ruining my fun
Leave me setting
At home all alone
Waitin on your call by the telephone
You said you're deadly
Everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you always was deadly
Comes in every shape and size
Deadly
Finally made me realize
That I tried and tried
But you just cant get enough
So you lied and lied and lied
I will not be denied
I'm gonna plant a seed
I will not be denied
Of the man and the love I need

Said you're deadly
Everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you are because
Deadly
Comes in every shape and size
Deadly
Always takes you by surprise
Its a sad situation
When yes it's true
I can say it baby
I'm through with you
Its over now
And in the past
Gonna find me a man
With a love that'll last
You know he's deadly
Everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you always been
Deadly
Comes in every shape and size
Deadly
Finally made me realize
That I tried and tried
But you just couldnt get enough
And so you
Lied and lied and lied
And I will not be denied
I will not be denied
I will not be denied

// I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again //

There ain't no use in me trying to tell you how I feel
'Cause what I feel ain't what you're feeling
I don't know what we did wrong
I just know if you come home
I ain't gonna let you break my heart again

There ain't no use in me trying to find out where you've been
Where you've been ain't where I'm going
'Cause if I ask you where you've been
The hurting starts and it don't end
So I ain't gonna let you break my heart again , no
I ain't gonna let you break my heart again , no o

Tears don't become me
Pain ain't my friend
It seems like you enjoy my crying , baby
You always said that I was strong
But I believe that you were wrong
Lately , God knows , I have been trying

There ain't no use in you trying to kiss away the hurt , baby
'Cause it hurts where it's deep down inside of me and it's hiding
If you decide you're coming home
You walk in , it won't be like before
'Cause I ain't gonna let you break my heart again , no
Ain't gonna let you break my heart again , no no

// The Road's My Middle Name //

I told you once the day we met
I wouldn't be your queen.
Your little darlin', sweet coquette
Just what my routine
You've been around enough to know
There's really no one else
When I hear that siren call, baby
I just can't help myself

I gotta go
I hope you'll understand
I love you so
Want you to be my man

I hear it callin'
Sound so sweet and plain
I gotta go, baby,
'cause the road's my middle name

Well, it's hard enough to love someone
When they're right close to home
Don't you think I know it's hard, honey
To squeeze the sugar from the phone

Guess the road is in my blood
'cause I'm my daddy's kid
Just have to learn how to let me go
Just like my momma did

I gotta go,
I hope you'll understand
Oh, I love you so
Want you to be my man

I hear it callin', baby
Sound so sweet and plain
I gotta go
'cause the road's my middle name

Here it come
And it sounds so sweet and plain
I gotta go
'cause the road's my middle name
I gotta go
'cause the road's my middle name
Oooh, I gotta go, darlin'
'cause the road's my middle name
