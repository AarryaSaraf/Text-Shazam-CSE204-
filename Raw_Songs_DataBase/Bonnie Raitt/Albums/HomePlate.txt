// What Do You Want The Boy To Do? //

So you think the man is crazy
He eats up your lies like they're good for him
Apple pie
He don't even cry
He is not a fool
He's just tryin' to do what his heart says to
To love you
As you take to the wind  (to the wind again my friend)
As he breaks down within (within within wthin)

[Chorus:]
He waits for you patiently
Hopin' that one day you'll see
That all he really wants to be
Is yours and yours alone eternally

What do you want the boy to do?
Don't you see you're breaking the child in two? 
What do you want the boy to do?
All he really wants is you...

He knows what you are
Still he'll be your game   (say the word today)
You'll know better   (build a world around him)
Now and then you'll promise
All the way-out things that you're gonna get
(You will see, you will be
so damn glad that you finally found him free to go)
As he watches you come and go  (for your show)
As he watches your promises zero  (zero zero zero)

He waits for you patiently
Hopin' that one day you'll see
That all he really wants to be
Is yours and yours alone eternally

What do you want the boy to do?
Don't you see you're breaking the child in two? 
What do you want the boy to do?
Don't you see that you're breaking the child in two?...

[Chorus]

// Good Enough //

The first time I brought you home
My mama said he ain't good enough
I don't want my girl to be alone
But I wonder is he good enough
I-I-I was doin some worryin' too
And I was thinkin' thinkin'
Am I good enough for you

The first time that I loved you
I know it was a little rough
But when at last we were still
You asked was it good enough
And I cried and looked in your eyes of blue
Cause I been prayin' prayin'
I was good enough for you
Good enough for you

Now I got to set your mind at ease
Got to stop your insecurities
Cause if anything
You're too good for me

Now it's strange how time's gone by
Since the day that we fell in love
And still some times we hafta ask ourselves
Was it good enough
And time is bound to make us see
Just how good
Good enough can be
Good enough can be
Good enough for you baby
Good enough for me

Now, It won't be long
Good enough for me
Keep me warm, baby
For me
Good enough for me

// Run Like A Thief //

Well it was alright at midnight and you fell out at three
So I made you warm and stoked the dying fire
When it all came down this morning you were lying next to me
How sweet the wine of desire
Well we cheated on a friend and cheaters never win
Oh the truth I know would be a small relief
I could never be the one to say
Her best friend took you down
Gonna run in the night hide when ever it's light
Gonna run in the night like a thief
Just ain't no use think it over I was blind but now I see
Well she's coming back and I know just what I'll do
If it comes right down to you leaving her or staying here with me
How sweet the memory of you
Well we cheated on a friend and it looks like I lose again
I could never be the one to say
Her best friend took you down
I'd rather run in the night hide when ever it's light
Gonna run in the night like a thief
Like a thief in the night hide when ever it's light
Gonna run in the night like a thief

// Fool Yourself //

Lookout boy your bound to change
You can't ever stay the same
Cause if ya keep on sayin the same ol'lies
Your gonna look around boy and find
Yourself outta time

Watchout girl the words you say
Don't really fit the play
Somebody else you might talk to now
And knows what ya say and what ya mean
But don't help this time

[Chorus:]
You might say that you ain't
Got a, hold on yourself
You might say that you only try your best
You might say that you only need a rest
You might say you can only fool yourself
Fool yourself, fool yourself

Don't believe the words you read
Their written on the street
Every time you try to lay their game
Their gonna knock you down
And take your pride away

See how bad you need to cry
But no matter how hard you try
Its the same old story once again
You always hide from the one
Who calls you friend
I call you friend

[Chorus]

Fool yourself [4x]

// My First Night Alone Without You //

There is an aching in my head
From the bed I can't get used to
It's these little hours in the dark, I dread
As I spend my first night alone without you

Honey, half of me has gone away
With all the love I learned to cling to
Tomorrow I'll have to find another way
To live the rest of my life alone without you

You taught me how to live
How to be myself
And how to give
Oh, but now it's you
Who's given up on giving

You've lost the thing, no one to teach
Changing and now you're out of reach
And my life tonight just don't seem worth living
No, no

I've been sitting learning how to read
Cause back in school I never liked to
It's just one of those little things I'm gonna need
As I put my life together, baby, without you

// Walk Out The Front Door //

I can't, I can't make love to your memory
I can't put my arms, around what used to be
Everything I had, was apart of me
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you

My friends tell me, it'll be alright
But my friends never, no, never held you close at night
Every dream I had, that could see the light
Well you went and it walked out the front door with you
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you

I never knew, I never thought that you'd take my love and tear it apart
I gave you my best, when I gave you my heart
Oh, are you listening?  Or is this all in vain?  yeah...
I still can't believe, you're never comin' back again

Everything I had, oh, except my pain
Well you went and it walked out the front door with you
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you... hey... yeah...
Well you went and it walked... well you went and it walked...
Right out the front door with you
Well you went and it walked right out
Never comin' back no more
Right out

// Sugar Mama //

Sittin here worryin'
While your lookin to find yourself
Somebody else
Me lovin' you and wantin' you baby
And you not knowin' what you want yourself
Why do you treat me so mean
It hurts so bad
All you wanna do is just sit around and jive
You dont' even know this woman's alive
Sittin' here worryin'
Knowin' your liikin' to find yourself

Ain't gonna be no sugar mama no more
You can't have love when your keepin' score
All you pretty boys used to catch my eye
I just want a man I can satisfy
Ain't gonna be no sugar mama no more

[Instrumental break]

Ain't gonna be no sugar mama no more
You can't have love when your keepin' score
All you pretty boys used to catch my eye
I just want a man I can satisfy
Ain't gonna be no sugar mama no more

// Pleasin' Each Other //

You remind me, you remind me
That it's a trick to know you.
I don't even know
How, I fel in love with you.
Was it your eyes, or was it your clothes,
Was the way you greeted me when the sun rolls, the sun rolls.
I was lonely when I first called you.
We were kids just foolin' with lovin'
You took me in, and you didn't even know me or my games.

I was out on the road, acting a lady
I was with him for one night for some love and a song
Then you came along, you don't care about money
You don't care about time,
And ourlove just keeps rolling, rolling along
Say hey don't you worry,
Cause we can get along
If were pleasin' each other
Pleasin'each other, pleasin' each other,
Can't be wrong.
[Repeat twice]

// I'm Blowin Away //

I've been romanced and dined and danced
Crazy nights and wild times
But life has lost its mystery
And love is blind and cannot find me

[Chorus:]
I'm blowin' away
And shadows take my love and leave
I'm blowin' away
These shadows keep takin' my love and leavin' me

I have cast aside my foolish pride
I'm goin' down for the last time
I have searched this earth and sailed these seas
But love is blind and cannot find me

[Chorus 2x]

// Sweet And Shiny Eyes //

Your sweet and shiny eyes
Are like the stars above laredo
Like meat and potatoes
To me

In my sweet dreams we are
In a bar
And it's my birthday
Drinking salty marguaritas with fernando

Young and wild
We drove 900 miles of texas highway
To the mexican border
As the day was comin' on

We crossed the rio grande river
And we swore we'd have things our way
When we happened to walk in to nuevo leon

Your sweet and shiny eyes
Are like the stars above laredo
Like meat and potatoes
To me

In my sweet dreams we are
In a bar
And it's my birthday
And we're having our picture taken
With fernando
