I want to feel my earth turn over,baby
In this hardened winter ground
Feel my earth turn over, darlin'
Till' I'm rootless and unbound
I want to feel my body tremble
When there's no one else around
Just this cool, clear water runnin'
In this love that I've found

Hey baby
See how it can be
Every time you reveal yourself tome
I'll come runnin'

I want to feel myself go under,baby
Where the deepest river bleeds
I want to feel it pull me under,darlin'
Until it drops me to my knees
I want to know that I can findyou
When there's no more eyes tosee
In this cool, clear water runnin'
You'll come runnin' to me

Hey baby
All my life I have known there'ssomething more
A love to blind me like the sun
Deep in dreams, I will wash upon your shore
Now I know that you're the one

When I feelmy babycallin'
It's like awhisper inAnd whenthe softestrain is fallin', darlin'
I will crumble in your hand
And when all that's left is wonder
And no need to understand
Well this cool, clear waterrunnin'
Will be all that I am...
