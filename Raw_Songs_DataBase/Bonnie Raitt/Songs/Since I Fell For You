When you just give love, and never get love,
You'd better let love depart.

I know it's so, and still I know,
I can't get you out of my heart.

You made me leave my happy home.
You took my love, and now you've gone,
Since I fell for you ...

My life has been such misery and pain.
I guess I'll never be the same,
Since I fell for you ...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad,
That I'm in love with you ...

When you love me, and then you snub me.
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you.

I guess I'll never see the light.
I get these blues most every night,
Since I fell for you ...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad,
That I'm in love with you...

When you love me, and then you snub me.
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you.

I guess I'll never see the light.
I get those blues most every night,
Since I fell for you ...

Since you loved me, then you snubbed me
I prayed you put no one above me
Now I'm black and blue since I fell for you

Since I fell for you, for you, yeah
