There's a time when the light inside of us feels the night
And we're runnin', there's no place to hide
There's a time when we have to stand alone
With our eyes on a world that we never have known

Where can you run to
But somewhere inside your heart
What can you hold to
But all that you were from the start


Stand up to the night
Though it's comin' down on you
You're the only one you have
That you can hold onto
Stand up to the night
Though you're crying no one hears
If you feel your soul would light the darkness disappears
Stand up to the night

There's a time and a place in your life when you realize
That the stranger will always be there
There's a cold in the heart of the world you know
No one cares if the night comes and takes you below

Where can you run to
But somewhere inside your heart
What can you hold to
But all that you were from the start
