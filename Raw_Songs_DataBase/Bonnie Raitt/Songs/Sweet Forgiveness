Yeah, well... 

When will I learn
To take you on my journey
When will I see, yeah
That you belong to me
When will I learn
To take you on my journey
When will I see, yeah
That you belong with me?

Sweet forgiveness
How could you go, my babe
I never really knew that I needed you
But you were right there
Understand me, yeah
Honey you set my sails
When will I learn to take you with me
Everywhere?
When will I learn...?  

(Sweet forgiveness)
Sweeter than honey
Give me that
Sweet forgiveness
Sweeter than wine

Hey...

Did you ever get lost
In a bundle of nerves
Did you ever get lost
In a jungle of your own words
You hurt another, hurt a brother
You hurt a sister or a lover
And then you go 'right'
Then you got to just sit back
And wait for the cure

Sweet forgiveness
How can you go, my babe
I never really knew that I needed you
But you were right there
Understand me, yeah
Honey you set my sails
When will I learn to take you with me
Everywhere?
When will I learn...?

(Sweet forgiveness)
Sweeter than honey
Give me that
Sweet forgiveness
Sweeter than wine  
Give me that
Sweet forgiveness
Sweeter than honey
Give me that
Sweet forgiveness
Sweeter than wine...
