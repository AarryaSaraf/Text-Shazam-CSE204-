Time, time ain't never healed the wound
Can't think of anything that gets
Any better 'cause it's old

Change, change would prob'ly do me good
Wouldn't prob'ly hurt a thing
Anyway, that's what I'm told

I would have run, but I couldn't run
Would have flown, but I couldn't fly
I woulda headed right back into town
I woulda lied, but I couldn't lie
'Cause I knew

Stop, stop and take a better look
There ain't no telling what you'll find
In the corner of a darkened room

Things, things that either one time fell
Or blew down from a windowsill
Or never got up by the broom

I would have run, but I couldn't run
Would have flown, but I couldn't fly
I woulda headed right back into town
I woulda lied, but I couldn't lie
'Cause I knew

No two ways about it, it's a doggone shame
Baby, it's a doggone shame

I would have run, but I couldn't run
Would have flown, but I couldn't fly
I woulda headed right back into town
I woulda lied, but I couldn't lie
'Cause I knew
