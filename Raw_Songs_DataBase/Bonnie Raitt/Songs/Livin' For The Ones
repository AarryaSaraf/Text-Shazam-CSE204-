I can barely raise my head off the pillow
Some days I never get out of bed
I start out with the best of intentions
And then shuck it instead

I don't think we'll get back how we use to
No use in tryin' to measure the loss
We better start gettin' used to it
And damn the cost

Go ahead and ask me
How I make it through
Only way I know is

Keep livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Keep livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Livin' for the ones

I'm livin' for the ones who didn't make it
Cut down through no fault of their own
Just keep 'em in mind, all the chances denied
If you ever start to bitch and moan

Just remember the ones who won't ever
Feel the sun on their faces again
Watch their grandkids collide, let it break you inside
Maybe this'll be the way you mend

Go ahead and ask me
How I make it through
Only way I know is

Keep livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Keep livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
