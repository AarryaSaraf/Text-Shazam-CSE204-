Bad mistake, crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game
Bad mistake is a crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game

Stopping thinking about what you want to do
Then taking a good look what's looking real good to you
I think we're hard about what it is you see
Is that really where you want to be

Look were hard alone
Seeing what's going on
It's a fool's game

Well, you're living rough, you're living on the street
When you're mind and your body and soul it ain't what you think
Well, you got a good parade energy use it if you can
You're gonna lie yourself to be a ragged on by the man

But there's a lot of jungle
There's a lot of land, to get caught in the middle
To try to make the best you can

It's a fool's game
It's a damn fool's game
It's a fool's game
It's a damn fool's game

But there's a lot of jungle
There's a lot of land, to get caught in the middle
To try to make the best you can

It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game

It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game

Bad mistake, crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game
Bad mistake is a crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game

Bad mistake, crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game
Bad mistake is a crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game

Bad mistake, crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game
