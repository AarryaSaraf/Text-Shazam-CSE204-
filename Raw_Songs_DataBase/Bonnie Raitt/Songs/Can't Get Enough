Come on so tough
When you think you got a right
Make love so rough
Until I lose the will to fight
You got that somethin', baby
That turns my darkness into light
And I can't get enough of your love

I never found a man
Who took the time to see
The woman that I am
And not the one he hoped I'd be
And I think we're onto somethin'
And it's good enough for me
I just can't get enough of your...

Aha haaa

Come on so tough
Baby, you know just how to please
You got that stuff
That brings this woman to her knees
I think we're onto somethin'
That is good enough for me
I just can't get enough of your...
I just can't get enough of your...
And I just can't get enough of your love

Can't get enough of your love, aha
Can't get enough of your love
Just can't get it
Can't get enough of your love, aha
Just can't get it
Can't get enough of your love...
