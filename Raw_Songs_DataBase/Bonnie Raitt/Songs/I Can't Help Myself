Can't help myself
I'm falling in love
I can't help myself
Can't help myself
I'm falling in love

Billy was a friend of mine
We used to walk down by the river
And he'd hold my hand
We were only ten or twelve years old
Didn't know about love
I found out
That it could hurt ya so



Jimmie was the one in high school days
We used to drive around the city
Thinking we'd grown up
Must've been just about sweet sixteen
I found a brand new world,
A brand new love
That I had never seen



No matter how hard I try
I just can't leave it alone
No use in wonderin' why
'Cause my heart has a mind of its own



But I keep on falling

Can't help myself
I'm falling in love
I can't help myself

I keep on falling

Can't help myself
I'm falling in love

I keep right on falling

Can't help myself
I'm falling in love
I can't help myself...
