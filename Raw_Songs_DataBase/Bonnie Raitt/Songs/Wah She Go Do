I could understand why a woman must have an outside man
I could understand why a woman must have an outside man
A man just wants to run like rat and have his wife to abide by that
Every night he's havin a ball and when he reach home he ain't touching his wife at all

And if the woman says she's feelin' sexy (Wah She Go Do)
And the man says he's feelin' sleepy (Wah She Go Do)
If you have a husband give him plenty of position
If he starts runnin just laugh don't say anything

An she's bawlin' "C'mon Doo doo" but this time it soft like soft candle
No satisfaction! So you see a woman must have an outside man
If he picks up an outside woman show him you can pick up two outside men
An that's the only way a woman should get some respect today

Every woman they want and usin' we as a convenience
Then they turn an' say they can't trust a woman today
For days he ain't seen his home; the man goes and leave his wife all alone
At the end when his head is bald; they go and don't know a woman never phone at all

An' if the man say "Lie down on de bed" ( Wah She Go Do)
Then the man lays down as if he's dead (Wah She Go Do)
An she wantin' water in she tank. Yet de man so damn disobedient
No satisfaction! So you see a woman must have an outside man
