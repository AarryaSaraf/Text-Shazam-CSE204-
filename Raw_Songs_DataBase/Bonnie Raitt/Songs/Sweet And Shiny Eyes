Your sweet and shiny eyes
Are like the stars above laredo
Like meat and potatoes
To me

In my sweet dreams we are
In a bar
And it's my birthday
Drinking salty marguaritas with fernando

Young and wild
We drove 900 miles of texas highway
To the mexican border
As the day was comin' on

We crossed the rio grande river
And we swore we'd have things our way
When we happened to walk in to nuevo leon

Your sweet and shiny eyes
Are like the stars above laredo
Like meat and potatoes
To me

In my sweet dreams we are
In a bar
And it's my birthday
And we're having our picture taken
With fernando
