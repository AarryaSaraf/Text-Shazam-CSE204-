A little rich girl I knew was fallin' apart
(She had it all)
Lost her dreams to find a piece of his heart
(He let her fall)
Now you're on your own and it's not the same
(Oh, things do change)
There is no one there who will take the blame
You just need some time to figure it out

All day, all night
Your way, this is your life
All day, all night
Your way

Take a look inside yourself and you'll find
(You still can win)
'Cause only you little girl can make up your mind
(You're your best friend)
Don't you worry 'bout that thing that you had
(You've got a chance)
You're lookin' good little girl so don't feel so bad
Spend a little time so you can figure it out

All day, all night
Your way, this is your life
All day, all night
Your way, oooooh

(Take a little time, figure it out 
Take a little time, figure it out)

A little rich girl I knew was comin' around
(She's got it all)
Keep lookin' up little girl and don't you look down
Spend a little time so you can figure it out


All day, all night
Your way, this is your life
All day, all night
Your way


All day, all night
Your way, this is your life
All day, all night
Your way
