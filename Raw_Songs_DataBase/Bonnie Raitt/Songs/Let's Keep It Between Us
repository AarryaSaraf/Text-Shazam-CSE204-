Let's keep it between us
These people meddling in our affairs
They're not our friends
Let's keep it between us
Before the whole door closes
And it comes to an end

They'll tell you one thing, me another
'Til we don't know who to trust
Oh darlin', let's keep it between us

Let's keep it between us
We've been through too much together
That they'll never share
They've had nothing to say to us before
Now all of a sudden it's as if
They've always cared

All we need is honesty
A little humility and trust
Oh darlin', can we keep it between us?

I know we're not perfect
Then again, so what!
Ain't no reason to treat you like a snake
Or to treat me like a slut
And it's makin' me so angry!

Could we just lay back for a moment
Before we wake up and find ourselves
In a game that we both have lost?
These easy cures and easy handsomes
Somethin' tells me we can't afford the cost

There's some things not fit for human ears
Some things don't need to be discussed
Oh darlin', can we keep it between us?

[Instrumental break]

They'll tell you one thing, me another
'Til we don't know who to trust
Oh darlin', let's keep it between us

Let's keep it between us
Before the whole thing breaks down
And goes too far
If we can't settle our differences by ourselves
Then we must be worse off than they think we are

Back seat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel
But they sure know how to make a fuss
Oh darlin', can we keep it between us? 
Can we keep it between us?
