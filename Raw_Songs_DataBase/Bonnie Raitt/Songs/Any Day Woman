If you don't love her you'd better let her go
You'll never fool her you're bound to let it show
Love's so hard to take when you have to fake
Everything in return
You just preserve her
When you serve her a little tenderness.

If she's a woman she'll try to make it last
If you're a man now you'd better end it fast
There's no reason here, no treason here
Just the way a womans mind
Well she has no name, she has no shame
She just loves you

It's not easy to undo what's done
Or to speak too freely to just anyone
And if this takes more than you bargained for
Boy it's time you learned
Not to talk so loud, not to walk so proud
When you're comin' on.
