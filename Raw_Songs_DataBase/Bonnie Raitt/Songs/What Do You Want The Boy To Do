So you think the man is crazy
He eats up your lies like they're good for him
Apple pie
He don't even cry
He is not a fool
He's just tryin' to do what his heart says to
To love you
As you take to the wind  (to the wind again my friend)
As he breaks down within (within within wthin)


He waits for you patiently
Hopin' that one day you'll see
That all he really wants to be
Is yours and yours alone eternally

What do you want the boy to do?
Don't you see you're breaking the child in two? 
What do you want the boy to do?
All he really wants is you...

He knows what you are
Still he'll be your game   (say the word today)
You'll know better   (build a world around him)
Now and then you'll promise
All the way-out things that you're gonna get
(You will see, you will be
so damn glad that you finally found him free to go)
As he watches you come and go  (for your show)
As he watches your promises zero  (zero zero zero)

He waits for you patiently
Hopin' that one day you'll see
That all he really wants to be
Is yours and yours alone eternally

What do you want the boy to do?
Don't you see you're breaking the child in two? 
What do you want the boy to do?
Don't you see that you're breaking the child in two?...
