All you got is this moment
Twenty-first century's yesterday
Can care all you wanna, baby
Everybody does yeah that's okay

So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind

I need you tonight
'Cause I'm not sleeping
Something about you, boy
That makes me sweat

How do you feel?
I'm lonely
What do you think?
Can't take it all
What you gonna do?
Gonna live my life

I need you tonight
'Cause I'm not sleeping, boy
There's something about you, baby
That makes me sweat

How do you feel?
I'm lonely
What do you think?
Can't take it all
What you gonna do?
Gonna live my life

I'm lonely
