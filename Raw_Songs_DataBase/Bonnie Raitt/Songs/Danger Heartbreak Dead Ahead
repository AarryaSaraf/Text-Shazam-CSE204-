When you give more than you get
You're in danger
You may find that you're in love
With a stranger

But who knows what evil
Lurks within the hearts of men?
It's vanity, insanity
You play what you can't win

If you find that you're losing
Girl, it's time to get on moving
'Cause there's danger
Heartbreak dead ahead

Well, it only takes one second, girl, to learn
That playing with fire will get you burned
So girl, don't you be foolish

They say that love is blind
But it's clear as the highway sign
That reads 'Danger, heartbreak dead ahead'
Heartbreak dead ahead

Better mind, girl, read the sign, girl
Yeah, danger and heartbreak dead ahead

I want somebody's boy
(Heartbreak dead ahead)
Start packing up your heart
Now listen to me, girl

There's nothing to be gained
So don't keep going on in vain
There's danger and heartbreak dead ahead
Yeah, I said, "There's danger and heartbreak dead ahead"

Danger, I said, "There's danger"
(Heartbreak dead ahead)
I said, "There's danger and heartbreak dead ahead"
Baby, yeah, I said, "There's danger"
(Heartbreak dead ahead)
