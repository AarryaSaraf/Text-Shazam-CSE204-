I keep her anger cocked and ready
Tucked in her stylin' holster
Draw the line in pretty colors
Just to dare some fool to cross her
I keep her righteousness on simmer
Though it's tastier on a boil
And her tongue stays nice'n sharp
The tighter she stays coiled

I love to let her lay around
Blowin' deadlines once again
Stock her up with lame excuses
For things she meant to send
I make her blow her diet
Till she slips to full-on binge
Then I up her shame about it
'Cause she looks so cute unhinged

I got her where she is today
But do I get respect?
She claims she's so above it now
She keeps all that mess in check
Recovery's a fickle beast
You better stick to what you know
And I'm always ridin' shotgun, baby
Just waitin' for you to you blow

Don't matter how much time you got
It's still a slippery ledge
You gotta keep an eye on every step
When there's no more bets to hedge
You can whine and boast, cut 'n run
And fall down on your knees
But if it ain't the full surrender, baby
It's all the same to me

It's funny how a little doubt'll muddle up her way
It only takes some darker thoughts to wreck her sunny day
I let her draw love close enough to see she really cares
But no way do they get inside in case there's no one there

No one there

I got her where she is today
But do I get respect?
She claims she's so above it now
She keeps all that mess in check
Recovery's a fickle beast
You better stick to what you know
'Cause I'm always ridin' shotgun, baby
Just waitin' for you to you blow

Da, na na na
Waitin' for you, baby
Waitin' for you to blow
