I don't have to beg you to hold me
'Cause somebody else will
You don't have to love me when I want it, no
'Cause somebody else will

Some kind friends say you don't need it
When all the time they're tryin' to get it
Look out, your good thing
Is about to come to an end
Your real good thing
Is about to come to an end

All those nights I watched the four walls
I did not have to watch 'em all alone
When other men said they wanted me, baby
I didn't have to tell them I was 
Your very own

You have all the love that I've got
Even ice melts to water and gets hot
Look out, your good thing
Is about to come to an end
Your real good thing
It's about to end



Gettin' myself back together
Is gonna be a be problem I know
But when the right man says he wants me
Boy, you can bet I won't tell him no
'Cause your real good thing
Is about to come to an end
Your real, your good thing
Your good thing baby
Your good thing
Your good thing
Your good thing baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
