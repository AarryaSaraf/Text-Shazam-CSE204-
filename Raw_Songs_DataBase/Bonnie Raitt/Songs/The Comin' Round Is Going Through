You got a way of running your mouth
You rant and you rave, you left it all out
The thing about it, little that you say is true
Why bother checkin', the facts will be damned
It's how you spin it, it's part of the plan
Well I'm here to tell you honey that
Your sicken loan is coming due

Only so long you can keep this charade
Until they wake up and see they've been played
Too many people with their livin' at stake
Ain't gonna take it
Comin' round is going through
Comin' round is going through

You say it's workin', it's tricklin' down
Yeah, there's a trick, 'cause the jobs ain't around
From where you're sittin' tell me how you think you possibly know?
The way it feels to get turned away
Never enough, it's day after day
Yank that by your bootstraps
'Cause that's the way it really goes

Only so long you can keep this charade
Before they wake up and see they've been played
Too many people with their livin' at stake
Ain't gonna take it
Comin' round is going through
The comin' round is going through

'Cause when the moneys makin' money, it comes down to a few
They got their hands on the throttle and nobody gets through
You can work all your life for a hand that will play
With one role of the dice it gets swept away
Just look around, things are startin' to slip
You're outta control and you're losin' your grip
No way to stop it, cause that river's spillin' over for good
We don't have the answer, we know what it's not
'Cause the people will keep pushin' until they all get a shot
Your money's no good here, we wouldn't cash you a check if we could

Only so long you can keep this charade
Before they wake up and see they've been played
Too many people with their livin' at stake
Ain't gonna take it
The comin' round is going through
Comin' round is going through
Comin' round is going through
Comin' round is going through
Quit that, baby!
Is going through
Is going through
