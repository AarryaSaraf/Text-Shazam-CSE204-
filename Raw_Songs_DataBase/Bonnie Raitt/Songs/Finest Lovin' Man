The man I'm lovin'
Don't worry 'bout me runnin' around
You won't ever find my baby
Hustlin' after me all over town
He don't have to shout
He don't even have to call
Knows I'm comin' home
Even if I got to crawl
He'll get me when he wants me
He's the finest lovin' man around

When he gets up in the morning
Or when he comes home late at night
You know the man's always hungry
Knows I'm gonna cook it up just right
He don't ever hurry
He just takes his time
Just a little taste is all it takes to make him mine
He'll get it when he wants it
He's the finest lovin' man around

Some women they act just
Like their men will never come to no good
You know they are always on the cheat
And never treat him like a good woman should
You want him to do you right
Honey, that ain't the way
You got to love him all night
You do just what he say
And you get just what you give out
That's the only way to gain his faith

[Solo]

Now me and my baby
We always know just what we're puttin' down
And we know we'll be together
Til the day when something better comes around
Til that day comes
You won't hear me complaining
I'll take him as like he is
Cause you know I can't change him
I'll love him best I can
He's the finest lovin' man around
