Daylight, I think about you and wonder where you are
At night I'm wishing, looking at the stars,
But I don't worry 'bout you, I know that soon you'll be home.
But while you're gone

Take my love with you.
Let it be the light that sees you through,
Chase away your blues.
Where you go and what you do,
Take my love with you.

I'll be your talisman.
I'll be your lucky charm.
Put it in your pocket.
Put it in your heart.
Then in your weakness, baby, just let it help you along.
And make you strong

Take my love with you.
Let it be the light that sees you through,
Chase away your blues.
Where you go and what you do.
Take my love with you.
Take my love with you.
Take my love with you.

And if the world around you begins to crumble and fall,
It wouldn't matter at all

Take my love with you.
Let it be the light that sees you through,
Chase away your blues.
Where you go and what you do
Take my love with you.
Let it be the light that sees you through,
Chase away your blues.
Where you go and what you do,
Take my love with you.
Take my love with you.
Take my love with you.
Take my love with you.
