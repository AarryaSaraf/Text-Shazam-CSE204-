Above the fray, my heart got tucked away
And I finally found some peace
I lost the taste for it, the pain and the waste of it
Love just wasn't meant for me

Just when I thought the coast was finally clear
You come bustin' in the door and pull me outta here
Now there's no denyin', baby, what you're doin' to me
Honey, I ain't lyin', 'cause baby feels so good to me

I pulled in tight, pushed back with all my might
And still you couldn't get enough

My last defense is slippin' out of reach
You got me where you want me, now I'm fallin' into the breach
Now there's no denyin', baby, what you're doin' to me
Ain't no use in tryin', 'cause baby you're so good to me

After all that Sturm and Drang I gave up long ago
One too many times around and nothin' left to show
You got that somethin', baby, that shakes me to the core
Pulled me straight out by the roots and got me holl'in more

Just goes to show, no way you'll ever know
What love's got up her sleeve
You think the game's up, headin' home and guess what?
She shows up with a sweet reprieve
No use in wonderin' if it's real or if it's not
With nothin' left to lose you might as well give it a shot

Now there's no denyin', baby, what you're doin' to me
Ain't no use in tryin', 'cause baby, we were meant to be
