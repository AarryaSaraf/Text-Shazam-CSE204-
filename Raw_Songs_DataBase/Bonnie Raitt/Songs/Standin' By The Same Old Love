I told you before
You know it may take a little while
I'd like to go there with you but
Runnin' just ain't my style
You want me to stay, well
You got to take it nice and slow
I'll show you the way
Just tell me if you want to know

I remember the time 
When we thought we'd never get enough
Tryin' to make a new love
And makin' it all at once
We wonder how we keep it up
After all these years
You worry 'bout your end, baby
I'll bring up the rear

I love you baby 
Don't you put me up against the wall
I ain't gonna jump every time
You need an overhaul
Maybe it'll take all night
But we'll do it 'til we get it right
And we'll be standin' by the same old love
That made us fall

There's a lot more to love
Than seein' how much love we can make
There's the kindness that makes it
So sweet 'til your little heart could break
And I want you to know
That I'm not just along for the ride
And I won't settle for less than
Everything I've got inside

I love you baby 
Don't you put me up against the wall
I ain't gonna jump every time
You need an overhaul
Maybe it'll take all night
But we'll do it 'til we get it right
And we'll be standin' by the same,
Standin' by the same
Well, we'll be standin' by the same old
Oughta be standin' by the same old love
Oooo, standin'
Standin'



Why aren't ya standin'?
Oughta be standin'
Why aren't you just standin'?
Why aren't you just standin'?
Why aren't you just standin'?...
