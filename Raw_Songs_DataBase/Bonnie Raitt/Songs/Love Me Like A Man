These men that I've been seeing, baby
Got their soul up on the shelf
You know they could never love me
When they can't even love themselves
But I need someone to love me
Someone to really understand
Who won't put himself above me
Who just loves me like a man

I've never seen such losers, darlin'
Even though I tried
To find a man who could take me home
Stead of takin' me for a ride
And I need someone to love me
I know you can
Believe me when I tell you
You can love me like a man

They all want me to rock them
Like my back ain't got no bone
I want a man to rock me
Like my back bone was his own
Darlin', I know you can
Believe me when I tell you
You can love me like a man

I come home sad and lonely
Feel like I wanna cry
I want a man to hold me
Not some fool to ask me why
And I need someone to love me
Darlin', I know you can
Don't you put yourself above me
You just love me like a man
