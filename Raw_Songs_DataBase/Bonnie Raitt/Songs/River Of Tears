I guess you got me in a sentimental mood
Never thot I'd feel this way again
Lyin' here with my dreams
I get so lonely thinking of you


River of Tears
Oceans of heartbreak
I want to feel
What your love can be
I close my eyes

Chances that I take
Got me so blind
Til I can't see
I never let you know just what's been on my mind
Never thot I'd hurt so bad for you lovin' this long
Lyin' here at nite alone
I keep on wonderin' just what went wrong



River of Tears
River of Tears
