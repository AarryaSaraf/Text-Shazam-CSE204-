Well, you must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Well, the highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Well, all your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty-handed armies, all going home
Your lover just walked out your door
Has taken all her blankets from your floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Well, leave your stepping stone behind, something calls to you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
Well, the vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Well, strike another match, go start anew
Oh, it's all over now, Baby Blue

Baby Blue
