You can tease me
You can sweet-talk and lead me on
But believe me
Won't be long till I'm catchin' on

Now you left me here with nothin'
And you put my love on hold
Well there must be somethin' behind those eyes
Cuz I believed every lie you told

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love
That ain't no way to treat a lady
I coulda sworn that you'd had enough

So you'd leave me
When I'm lonely and in despair
It intrigues me
How you don't really seem to care

Well I ain't here for nothin'
And my love doesn't come that cheap
I would hold you to all your promises
If I could find one you meant to keep

That ain't ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love
That ain't ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love

You can tease me
You can sweet-talk and lead me on
But believe me
Won't be long till I'm catchin' on

Cuz I ain't here for nothin'
And my love doesn't come that cheap
And I would hold you to all your promises
If I could find one you meant to keep

That ain't ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love
That ain't ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love
