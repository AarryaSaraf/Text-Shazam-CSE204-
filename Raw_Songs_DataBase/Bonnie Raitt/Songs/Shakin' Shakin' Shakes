The wind blows through the valley
It's warm and hard and wild
It gets all up inside the trees and shakes the leaves all night
They shake up through the mountains
They shake up to the sky
They shake up to the moon above and then it starts to shine

And Lord it makes me tremble
Lord it makes me tremble

Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Baby, shakin' and shakin', shakes

A fault runs through the valley as long as it is mean
It starts to tear into the earth and gets all in between
It shakes up through the mountains
It shakes down to the sea
It shakes up to the volcano and then it starts to scream

And Lord it makes me tremble
Lord it makes me tremble

Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes

There's a woman in this valley
She's sweet as she is rough
And when she starts to dance that way
She shakes the boys all up
She shakes it through the mountain
She shakes it through the night
She shakes it like a hurricane
She gives a blind man sight

And Lord it makes them tremble
Oh Lord it makes them tremble

Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Baby, shakin' and shakin', shakes

Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes

Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes

Shake that thing, baby, shake it!
