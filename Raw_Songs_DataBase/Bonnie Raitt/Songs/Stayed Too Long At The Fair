Jesus cried, wept and died
I guess he went up to heaven
I've been downtown such a long, long time
I'll never make it home by seven
Won't you come and take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And, lord, I just can't stand it anymore

Well I went down to Chason's
Walked 'til my feet got sore
I never knew what laughin' was
'Til you walked out the door
Won't you come and take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And, lord, I just can't stand it anymore

Well, you can give my soul to Abraham
Give my soul to Saul
Give my bones to Canada
My feet they don't hurt at all

I don't know who made the highway
I guess that's just my pride
But I have heard the prince of darkness
On his charger ride

The silver blade is gleamin'
The scales are in his hands
I swear another night is fallin'
Don't you lose another man
Won't you come and take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And, lord, I just can't stand it anymore
