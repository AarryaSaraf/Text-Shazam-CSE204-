I gave my love a candle
A promise at life
And I told him when my number comes up
Winds would fill the sky
Me I'm fixin' to die
Moving down that same lonesome road
No I don't know why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You didn't have to fool me
You didn't have to lie
My love comes around like a thief in the night
But only love can make you cry
And we have walked side by side
Moving down that same lonesome road
No I don't know why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Your love was like a diamond ride a wave
On a sea that calms my mind
Moving onward to a distant shore
Where the boats sail in a line
We have danced to a fateful rhyme
Moving down the same lonesome road
No I don't know why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You didn't have to fool me, no
You didn't have to lie
If it all came out so ugly
It's only my love that could make you cry
And we have walked side by side
Moving down that same lonesome road
And I still don't know why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Ooh ooh ooh
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
