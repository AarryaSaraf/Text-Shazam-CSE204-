I heard you say
life can't go on this way
and you need to change your view.
So you packed up and moved out of my life.
To find a world of your own.
Even now that you've up and gone.
For you there's still a place in my heart
only real love in my life
That even time can't erase.

So darlin'
Keep this heart in mind
whenever the lights of love don't shine.
Darlin' keep this heart in mind
everytime.

I knew you cared
Cause in your letters you would write and say
that you missed my lovin' every day.
Well if that's true,
all I'd ever why
aren't you next to me.
And you call me on the telephone
afraid because you're all alone
Well, Baby, just remember
Oh love will abide

So darlin'
Keep this heart in mind
whenever the lights of love don't shine.
Darlin' keep this heart in mind
everytime.
