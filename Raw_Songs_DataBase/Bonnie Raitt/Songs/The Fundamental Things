Let's run naked through these city streets
We're all captives of captivity
Let's wear madness like a crucifix
Let's tattoo Bible quotes across both our hips


Let's get back to the fundamental things
Let's get back to the elements of style
Let's get back to simple skin on skin
Let's get back to the fundamental things

Let's dance barefoot over broken glass
Slither like a snake does through the wet, cold grass
Howl and tremble in a sleepless grind
Let's do the braindrain, leave it all behind



You can sit in your room and worry
You can contemplate the end
Or let your house burn down behind you
Run bare-ass through the streets again

You can hide out on your rooftop
Wishing you had never been
Or go down to Hal's bar and grill
Find your innocence again
