Walkin' in a nightmare 
I've been burnin' in a cold sweat
There you stand lookin' for my heart
But you took it with you when you left
I don't care to hear
I don't wanna hear what you say

We had a world and a xxxx 
Yeah you really had a way with words
You kept me tied to a dream 
And I never got what I deserved
I don't care to hear
I don't wanna hear what you say
Cause I knew you'd come runnin' back to me
When the nights got long 
You say you missed the way it used to be
When my love was strong
I knew you'd come runnin' back to me
When your luck was down
I knew you'd come runnin' back and see
I was the best around

[Instrumental break]

Lookin' out my window 
I remember when you drove away
I never heard you say goodbye
I gave up thinkin' you'd be here today
Well I can't hear, I don't wanna hear what you say
Cause I knew you'd come runnin' back to me
When the nights got long 
You say you missed the way it used to be
When my love was strong
Knew you'd come back to me
When your luck was down
I know you'd come runnin' back and see
I was the best around

Round and round the tables turned
It's you who longs to hold me fast
Last chance was the last chance for you

[Instrumental break]

Runnin' back to me
Yeah, you come runnin' back to me
Well I knew you'd come back to me
When your nights got long
You said you missed the way it used to be
When my love was strong
I knew you'd come runnin' back to me
When your luck was down
I knew you'd come runnin' back and see
I was the best around
Best around, yeah baby
I knew you'd come runnin' back and see
