Just a bunch of guys getting in the car
No matter who's driving or for how far
Feels so good, (it's) been so long
No backseat drivers tell us how to drive
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys
Me and my buddies just like to go
We'll have fun (We're having fun); Everybody knows
We don't fuss and we never cry
We just groove, taking in the sights
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys
Don't raise questions 'bout how it's done
We're just messing 'round, having fun
(The) car gear shiftin' well up and down
The muffler's a little loud, but we love that sound
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys
It ain't like us to hang around this town
Cause squares just bring us down
I've got to find me something new
(I) don't wan' think about what they do now
The future's gonna drive around, and we don't care
'Cause wherever we're going, we'll soon get there
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
