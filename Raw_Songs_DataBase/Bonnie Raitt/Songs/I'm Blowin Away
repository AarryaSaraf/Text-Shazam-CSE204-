I've been romanced and dined and danced
Crazy nights and wild times
But life has lost its mystery
And love is blind and cannot find me


I'm blowin' away
And shadows take my love and leave
I'm blowin' away
These shadows keep takin' my love and leavin' me

I have cast aside my foolish pride
I'm goin' down for the last time
I have searched this earth and sailed these seas
But love is blind and cannot find me
