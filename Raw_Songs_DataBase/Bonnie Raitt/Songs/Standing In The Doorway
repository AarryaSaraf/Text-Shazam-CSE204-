I'm walkin' through the summer nights
Jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was goin' too fast
Today it's moving too slow.

I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you
If I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
I got nothing to go back to now.

Maybe they'll get me, and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things that I could say but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near.

I've been riding the midnight train
I've got ice water in my veins.

I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against any rule
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Sufferin' like a fool.

When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy, you're old no more
I can hear church bells ringin' in the yard
I wonder who they're ringin' for?

Oh, I know I can't win
But my heart, it just won't give in.

I see nothin' to be gained by any explanation
There are no words that need to be said
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Blues wrapped around my head.
