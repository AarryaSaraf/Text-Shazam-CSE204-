It starts out slow
With go ahead and go
Pretty soon the melody is like a rainstorm tin roof symphony
But it starts out slow

It goes on and on
For way too long
It always ends on a bad note
If you could dance at all, you'd dance alone
It goes on and on

The quiet behind a slamming door
The break of a heart that won't break no more
Get-away wheels in a straight line
Serenade of a made up mind

There ain't no rhyme
Just wasted time
Moonlight spotlight shining down on a made up mind and a love gone wrong
There ain't no rhyme

The quiet behind a slamming door
The break of a heart that won't break no more
Get-away wheels in a straight line
Serenade of a made up mind

The quiet behind a slamming door
The break of a heart that won't break no more
Get-away wheels in a straight line
Serenade of a made up mind

Of a made up mind
Moonlight spotlight shining down on a made up mind
Moonlight spotlight shining down on a made up mind and a love gone wrong
Moonlight spotlight shining down on a made up mind and a love gone wrong
