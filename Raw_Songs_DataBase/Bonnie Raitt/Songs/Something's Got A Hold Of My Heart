I'm stuck, stuck in the middle
Feel the quicksand pulling me down
Lovestruck, don't mean a little
Head keeps spinnin' round and round

Ain't natural, I'm walkin' sideways
Love potion goin' to my brain
Lights out, when you came my way
Feels good when you're going insane

And I don't feel like a fool
But I feel intoxicated
Never knew it could feel this good
Don't know why I waited
For the love of me

No one, drive me crazy
Like the crazy you drive me
Blast off, planet Venus
Ain't no use to revive me

And I know just what I want to do
And when I want to do it
Never knew this could feel so bad
Don't know why I waited
For the love of me

Somethin's got a hold of my heart
Somethin's got a hold of my heart
Yes I truly do believe love is finally on the scene
Somethin's got a hold of my heart

And I don't feel like a fool
But I feel intoxicated
Never knew it could feel this good
Don't know why I waited
For the love of me

Somethin's got a hold of my heart
Somethin's got a hold of my heart
Yes I truly do believe love is finally on the scene
Somethin's got a hold of my heart
