Well, you took my heart
And you broke it apart
Why did a love, baby, yeah
Have to ever start?
You know you took my love
You threw it away
And you're gonna want
My love someday
Well, bye bye baby

Well, I thought your love
Was oh so true
And you made me, baby
Start lovin' you
And then you took my love
You threw it away
Well, you're gonna want
My love someday
So, bye bye baby

Well, your love was sweeter than
Any I know so
Don't come back runnin' or
Knockin' on my front door

Well, you said that I
Was your only girl
And that there was no other, yeah
In this whole wild world
Well, you took my love
You threw it away
Now you're gonna want
My love someday
Well, bye bye baby
