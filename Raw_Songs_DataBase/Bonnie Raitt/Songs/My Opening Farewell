Baby stands before an open window
Looking so far away
He can almost feel the Southern winds blow
Gently touching his restless day

He turns from his window to me
Sad smile, his apology
Sad eyes reaching to the door
Did I lose to his to another evening
Still he spares me the words goodbye
Sits alone beside me fighting his feelings
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry

Suddenly it's so hard to find
The sound of the words to speak his troubled mind
So I'm offering these to him as if to be kind
There's a train every day
Leaving either way
There's a world you know
There's a way to go
I soon believe it's just as well
This is my opening farewell

A child's drawings left there on the table
And a womans silk is laying on the floor
I would keep them here if were able
To lock you safe behind this open door

Suddenly it's so clear to me
That I asked you to see what you may never see
Now my kind words find their way back to me

There's a train everyday
Leaving either way
There's a world you know
Gotta way to go
I soon believe it's just as well
This is my opening farewell
This is my opening farewell
