How many teardrops gonna fall tonight
How many heartaches can a woman have in one life

I lost a lover, lost a friend
Through with love I just can't win


Three time loser
Three time loser

How many hours, your love I'm gonna wait?
How many heartaches you really think I'm gonna take?

I lost a lover, lost a friend,
You were that kind, whoa You will never win.



One
Two
Three
In misery
