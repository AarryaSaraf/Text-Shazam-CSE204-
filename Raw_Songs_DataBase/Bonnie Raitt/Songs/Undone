There's a sword at the tip of my tongue
That shows no mercy on the latest one
And I was wrong with all my might
I took you out in one last round tonight

And there's no more shouting and no more tears
Just the fatal words ringing in our ears
And in the silence it's crystal clear
There's no undoing what is happened here

We've come undone
We've come undone
Battle waged, nothing won
Oh what have I done
The blood has run
Some things can't be undone

We hurt the ones we love the most
A thousand memories go up in smoke
And in the morning when ashes fall
There'll be no need for any words at all

We've come undone
We've come undone
Battle waged, nothing won
What have I done
The blood has run
Some things can't be undone

There's no joy in victory
When it comes at your defeat

Oh we've come undone
Lord, what have I done
Some things can't be undone
