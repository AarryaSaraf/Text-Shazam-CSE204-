Two years of dust swept in the corner
Two years of junk and magazines
A picture of a sunset that you drew me
Folded in a box of memory

Damn, that winter nearly killed us
Cooped up every night and day
But we have this thing in common
Well, you know he likes it as much as me

I don't mind
One tear, one sigh
But keep me in your thoughts when we say goodnight

Take down that picture from the wall
A blank canvas before our eyes
We don't need those things no more
Another day, a new sunrise

I don't mind
One tear, one sigh
But keep me in your thoughts when we say goodnight

I don't mind
One tear, one sigh
But keep me in your thoughts when we say goodnight

Release myself from earthly things
Well it's foolish, but it bears my name
It's grown to become part of me
We'll leave them behind just the same

I don't mind
One tear, one sigh
But keep me in your thoughts when we say goodnight

But I don't mind
One tear, one sigh
But keep me in your thoughts when we say goodnight
