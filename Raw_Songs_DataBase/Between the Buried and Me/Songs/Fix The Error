Break free from the maze!

Watch the distant fires
There's trust in what we've done
Our shallow grave of freedom
A new life that's just begun

I'm the fortune teller
Who doesn't know his past
Giving hope and new memories
To the future's rising sun

We're here to bring it down
Collapse society
We were born for this
It's time to celebrate
We're here to bring it down
Collapse society
We were born for this
It's time to celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate

Break free from the maze!

Doom-scroll past this frame of mind
The last of its kind
We now have come alive
The horror has ceased to be
The guest is now free
We are free

The mountain is rising
Fire blasts into the sea
A storm is coming
Red light
Dark room

If you see the rainbow, there is no tomorrow
It's wrapped in plastic
If you see the rainbow, there is no tomorrow
Put your face inside it

We're here to bring it down
Collapse society
We were born for this
It's time to celebrate
We're here to bring it down
Collapse society
We were born for this
It's time to celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
