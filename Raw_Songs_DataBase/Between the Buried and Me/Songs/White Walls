The monsters are made, and we have proven that we will be one of them
The whores take the stage
The whores take the stage...flash our skills
Gotta draw 'em in... gotta keep 'em on their toes, on their toes
Don't show them how you truly are... who would want honesty
Who would want a group of people that one can relate with?

They have to look up... simple peasants
Who the fuck thinks we can all be on a similar plane

We need worship
We need worship

We need devotion
Becoming gods from the image that is thrown
Thrown out in their everyday lives to comfort

It's not a musical journey anymore
They chose Camilla and we stood by her the entire time
Monotonous expression...a forced replica of a tired sound
Puppets for a greed-driven carnival
The same charade as the passing years
Force me out there
Don't give them a chance
Don't give them a chance

They want to be fed...fed a simple replication of past greatness

We just need to throw some new ideas in
It will eventually get out of this closed off circle we are part of
Get out of this closed off circle
Get out of this closed off circle
It's all the same

This is all we have when we die
It's what's left of us when we die
We will be remembered for this
We will be remembered for this
We will be remembered for this
We will be remembered for this

The same
