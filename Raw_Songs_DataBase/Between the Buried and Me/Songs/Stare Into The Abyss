Life is love
Time is never lost
Life is love
Let it go and collect
Seize these memories
We never regret
We never forget
The dream can wash away
We never regret
I'm so scared I'll forget

Time is never lost (Empty space)

Eyes turn away

Eyes turn away
Inside out
Into a space trained by your brain
It's never enough
It's never enough
You'll regret the wish
Let it go and collect your life before you die

Eyes turn away
Inside out
Into a space trained by your brain
It's never enough
It's never enough
You'll regret the wish
Let it go and collect your life before you die

Embrace these memories
We never regret
