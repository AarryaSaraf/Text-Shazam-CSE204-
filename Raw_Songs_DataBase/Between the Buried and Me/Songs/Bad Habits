These words (Will be the end of me)
These words (Bring a new life to me)

Stacked upon one another, yet I cannot grip
(I cannot grip)

These words (Render through a cosmic sea)
These words (Revoke our life to be)

Stacked upon one another, yet I cannot grip
(I cannot grip)

Contagion has shut
Down

Ground control to minor 3rds
Overtake and shed some sleep
Harmony loves tragedy in our own jeopardy

I cannot seem to say
Say what I need
They have my tongue
Let's cut it out

Can't speak over you
My words keep losing meaning
(Can't speak over you)
Maybe don't take it so serious
(My words keep losing meaning)
Three syllables to complete a thought

I get caught
Becoming lost
As words have quickly left me

The winds howl around their lost souls today
Stuck in a spectrum between the living and the dead
Their open mouths enter the worms of the living
Slither in and out

The winds howl around their lost souls today
Stagnant air lifts up the creature myth
Stuck between life and death
An order to connect and forget

Time is evaporating
Time is still

I cannot seem to say
Say what I need
They have my tongue
Let's cut it out

I cannot seem to say
Say what I need
They have my tongue
Let's cut it out

In order to connect and forget
Connect and forget
In order to connect and forget
Connect and forget

In order to connect and forget
Connect and forget
In order to connect and forget
Connect and forget

Sleep on, fly on (In order to)
In our minds (Connect and forget)
(Connect and forget) We can fly

Sleep on, fly on (In order to)
In our minds (Connect and forget)
(Connect and forget) We can fly
