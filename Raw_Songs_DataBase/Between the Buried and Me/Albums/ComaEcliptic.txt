Album: ComaEcliptic

// Node //

Turn the knob to reveal the light
Stare across the empty night

Dark worlds engrossing ... our sun is sleeping
The dance has lost its step
The teeth will be shown no more
Alone we find the escape
(We walk and walk and walk)
Alone we risk it all

Turn the knob to reveal the light
Stare across the empty night

The world has lost
Our minds roam free

// The Coma Machine //

You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
Lift our limbs to focus
We soon drift through the night

The getaway... we drought the cloud of life
A quick escape to velvet

Start to drift in slumber. Smoke fills the velvet room

No more options to cope. A glimpse of the hanging rope
Madness embrace the vault. Cannot wait any longer
A string of lights blink... mesmerize my senses
A pulse that keeps me together for one last time
No more options to cope. A glimpse of the hanging rope
Madness embrace the vault. Cannot wait any longer
A string of lights blink... mesmerize my senses
A pulse that keeps me together for one last time

Lift our limbs to focus
We soon drift through the night
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there

Travel through a string of tears
Screams crash down like waves
Flushing my mind of a new world
(Afraid to open my eyes)
Climb the hill of the wrist... enter oblivion
Oblivion

Foreshadow the Shadow:
My last exhale
Knees crash down on

Now rewind

You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there

What once was

// Dim Ignition //

An ancient figure crowds my focused path
His lightning bolt eyes creep through my sights

Render the dwellers with freedom
Matter develops your kingdom
Dim Ignition

Walk reverse

// Famine Wolf //

Grind down
Blind taste
Dripping ideas turn against our will
Swallow the chosen soul

One Animal
Once lived... for life

Human mist rise
Sweet devouring teeth are sharpened
Swallow the chosen soul

One Animal
Once lived... for life
One Animal
Once lived... for life

The fifth resonating host
Sweaty palmed inside constant alert
Blinking around the bubble of the paranoid
We are all that's left. We will be enough

One Animal
Once lived... for life
One Animal
Once lived... for life

Scour the earth. Turn the dirt red
(This can't be our lifeline)

Anchored mind wind... across the fog
We disgrace the pupil's sight

A homeless meat
The street markets replaced their souls
Gripping our oldest thoughts
Society has me out cold
It has me out in the cold

Move the flesh over this rotten bone
One more day

This can't be our lifeline

// King Redeem / Queen Serene //

I can't hear a thing
These waves crash faster
I can't see a thing
These arms grab for wonder

Enter this widened space
Inside our own small cage

I can't hear a thing
These waves crash faster
I can't see a thing
These arms grab for wonder

King redeem
Queen serene
Dusk drifts by with one last try

Clench... trapped... lids fold inside
Blurred mind... dry tears foam from high
Sleep walk past my cornea
Eclipse washed out... unscathed
Search for the formal stage

I slip past my own mind
A small gift taken from my time

Mute mouth
Mute mind

Color spectrum false, invoke heart rate race

Hysteria develops a hold
Raging winds force the earths
Symphony through my ears
Clarity is not known
A fortress blackened by a dissolving sun
A visual memory vanishes
Presence of hope intertwined

A transcript lost from what we've taught
To speak is not an act without our tongues
The human race has been deformed
A quilt of skin surrounds our lungs

Build an arrow to force a grim corrupted turn
Color spectrum is now false
Our eyes will see no more

A transcript lost from what we've taught
To speak is not an act without our tongues
The human race has been deformed
A quilt of skin surrounds our lungs

Build a monster to bury the infected worm
Color spectrum is now false
Our eyes will see no more

Mute mouth
Mute mind

King redeem... Queen serene
Blinded bells... the deafened sing
Hysteria develops a hold
Clarity is not known

We cough the future
We scratch the past

Into the circular I grab the jagged gaze
Color spectrum false invoke heart rate race

A transcript lost from what we've taught
To speak is not an act without our tongues
The human race has been deformed
A quilt of skin surrounds our lungs

// Turn On The Darkness //

The winters grieve evenly
Flickering moments engage our senses
Slowly trembling and venting
They won't take notice

Dragging feet. Will time notice me?

We turn our backs on ourselves
Nothing in sight

The Sighting:
I see a flame erupt in the distance
The charted course towards my direction
A wealth of moving light, they now seek my disguise
Legs soon crack as they stand above/below

The Exchange:
"Where do you drift from sir?
This land is for those who have lost
Our humanity has passed its course
We roam with all that's left"

I come from a movable past
A distant future is in my grasp
You all will survive this fate
Trust the man you gaze

Take me with your flames
Darkness
Show the brighter way
Hopeless
Take in all. Sit with our teachings

Above. Below
Take in all
Above. Below
Sit with our teachings

Dream tonight to push us forward

Black ash improves me. Dark skies are hollow

Above. Below
Take in all
Above. Below
Sit with our teachings

Dream tonight to push us forward

Black ash improves me
Can't look past the damage to this life
Dark skies are hollow
Can't look past the damage to this life

The Torchbearer:
"Welcome to our journey. Please walk with me
I'll put your mind at ease
Our breath disrupts their flames
We walk through their walls
Life exists apart from this."
This lone world drifts on and on

In the distant light modern man awaits
Dripping jaw accept our twisted travel
Lose focus
Screaming grins howl loud from high
A gritty focus gripped

We turn our backs on ourselves
Nothing in sight
We turn our backs on ourselves
They won't take notice

// The Ectopic Stroll //

Sit down please. Sir, what is your woe?
My thousand year old wisdom will help you grow
The fantasy of the rewind
I can dissect a man of your kind

Please Doc I need help
My walls are covered in velvet

We can't get it right

Old man
Chopping at his block
Old soul
Sanding his work
Lost land
Hysteria in practice
Lost hand
Tumbling down the well
Tumbling down the well

Our troubled thoughts are drugged away
No need for our sanity

Let's now start over
Let's begin our lives
Go back to where we came from
Let's now start over
Let's begin our lives
Your voice is silent

Sit down sir and lend me your mind
I'll twist and tinker every circuit that's inside
This fantasy of your soul
You'll soon accept all I know

We can't get it right

Speed up your joy
We can't get it right
We can't get you right

Take me back to my past

Let's now start over
Let's begin our lives
Go back to where we came from
Let's now start over
Let's begin our lives
Your voice is silent

Take me back to my past
Take me back to my past
Take me back

// Rapid Calm //

Speak now old soul... Distant breathing
Your choice soon exists
Speak now old soul... A choice will soon be yours
Speak your time

Darkness embracing our sun
Darkness embracing our sun
The rising smoke awakens me

A crest for the brave falls in the fog
A light shines from a distant land of ghosts
They don't want you there
They don't want me here
Remember my name?
The machine is crumbling

A crest for the brave
A light shines from a
Enter oblivion

Darkness embracing
Our sun is lifting
You'll soon give up on this world

The rising smoke awakens
An all white room... Lifts me with its lights
Nothing in focus. Curiosity is no more
"Accept all we are given. It is all here for a reason"

A golden lever... A choice for gold or velvet
Do I go on, or follow the robes in the smoke?
"Accept all we are given. It is all here for a reason"

One last search
Our shallow minds embrace this dream
One last search
To kneel in the famine room
One last search

You'll soon give up on the world

// Memory Palace //

Awake me
Stoic and ready. Living in levity
Static entry

Chatter has left me. A statue grown
With intentions from my own
I stutter on. Key driven
A swollen breeze insults me
The scent of a natural place

Chatter has left me. A statue grown
With intentions from my own
I stutter on. Key driven
Horrid thoughts finally leave me
Dismiss the notion of the unwanted force

Static entry. Alone and free

Awake me
I never want to get out of here
Visions of my past will disappear
I never end

Focus on melody
The sounds under my eyes
Dreaming inside of this world inside my mind
Drift on
Never end

Static exit. Animate

Tubes swim with my veins
An orchestra of lights graze over my corpse
Our souls are melting
Immobilized limbs secret liquid smoke
Fill the room with fear
A losing act draws in the final wake
Overcome "the end"

I did not. I did not want to come back
I did not... Take me back

It's over

I sit drenched in the summary of my past
Live in the name of the ghost
I drift on

Focus on melody
The sounds under my eyes
Dreaming inside of this world inside my mind
Drift on
Never end

// Option Oblivion //

Real eyes
A golden lever. A choice of gold or velvet
Do I go on, or follow the crown in the smoke?
My last choice derange my voice
Real eyes

The lever falls down so delicate

Enlighten me
I'll follow towards the smoke
The wrenching of the rope
I'm always lost
The idea of dreaming in a dream
My vision is serene
Please lift me up

Breathe underwater
Swim without limbs

These new eyes will never suffer
Enter the new wake
Looking back through the painful tunnel
They taught us what once was
What once was

New air opens my mouth
Gasp a new breath
What is this place? An alluring frontier

// Life In Velvet //

Fresh air grips me
Rolling hills on far
The smell of the living. Awakens all I am

Lift my limbs to focus
Beauty is in sight
The hours I cherished are now false

My last exhale is purple smoke
Knees crash down on velvet robes

Dark worlds engrossing
Our sun is sleeping
