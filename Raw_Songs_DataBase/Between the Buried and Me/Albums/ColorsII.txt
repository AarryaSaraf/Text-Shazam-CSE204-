// Monochrome //

I'm not the writer
It's you
For I'm drenched in error and silhouettes
We've been on this same page before
Together
Forever
Together as one

I'm not the writer
It's you
For I'm drenched in error and silhouettes
We've been on this same page before
Together
Forever
Together as one

It's all happening
Embrace or implode
A vortex of doubts and fears
Colliding over and over again

Rearing heads
Fix the error
Investigate
Fix the error

The mire city is oozing the struggles of humanity

// The Double Helix Of Extinction //

Kleptomania
Hearsay is drawing blood
Nature has lost its solace
Welcome the scathing solution

Comfort is the sore beginning of tragedy
Our city has crept into your valley

A feeble human form
Spiraling down vacant streets
The metallic leaves slosh under its barren soles
Peering out
Rain slides down our cancerous skin
Burn, let the burn in
The advertisement - "Diminish Your Existence"

Our city has trashed your valley
Our city has scorned your maker

Neon trees are littered
Strangling the passing season
The old baron, too tall for the weak to survive
A carnal howl silenced
It cracks the surface of pestilence
The advertisement-

Our city has trashed your valley
Our city has scorned your maker

Comfort is the sore beginning of tragedy
Our city has crept into your valley
When are you from?
Where did we run?
Transcribing hope that quickly slips away
Slips away

"Remember the good ol' days?" The robot would say
Conjoin the collective day
Atomic family

Heal your mind
I enter bliss
Psychosis

Digital bath, scrubbing us clean
Feel the downfall
Exfoliate

We're our own leeches
The cycle continues
Ancient gardens seen in dreams
We're on our own leashes
Recycle

Turning black and secreting secrets
Of our past, the baron allows
Dropping the poison in our fountain
We all drink the collective doom
Recycle
Recycle our fear

Our city will crumble
Our city wears turmoil
Our damning God strikes down
We have scorned our maker

Nature seeps into concrete
It's up to us to reshape this course
Between the buried and me
It's up to us to reshape this course
Between the buried and me
Between the buried and me

It's up to us to reshape this course
Between the buried and me
Between the buried and me

// Revolution In Limbo //

We didn't live (We didn't live)
We only existed
Undo the worker (Undo the worker)
The corporate vice turned inside out
Exposed for what it truly is
The horizon has just met the sun
The days and nights have folded into one

Over and over
Day in, day out
Monotonous drought

The sights and sounds are all the same
The smell of morning enters a declining brain
One more step out of this door
One more step to end this life
We feel no more

(Rinse, repeat) We are superior
(Rinse, repeat) Drench yourself in our word

Keep your eyes to the floor
Follow the repressive maze
Keep your eyes to the floor
A city built on pain
Drench yourself in our ideas

Over and over
Day in, day out
Monotonous drought
We didn't live
We only existed

Top of the morning to you
Keep your eyes to the floor
Follow the dotted lines
A maze created for productivity
For us, for them

A city built on your pain
Cranes hanging your lifeless bodies

The colors painting the canvas
Of our ancestors

A city built on your pain
Cranes hanging your lifeless bodies
A city built on your pain
Cranes hanging your lifeless bodies

The colors painting the canvas
Of our ancestors
The colors painting the canvas
Of our ancestors
Lost invitation

The sights and sounds are all the same
The smell of morning enters a declining brain
Color the city of hurt
We creak and sway with every turn
The shouting minds whisper

Don't sit long
Old habits turn the line of the vultures
Looking to collapse the position
Peeking through, year after year
They see your only weakness
And today they will start their feast
Their feast

A city built on your loss
Obsessive to the point of panic
You pushed your lifeline away
Drift off into other lives
A lost memory
A city built on your loss
Obsessive to the point of panic
You pushed your lifeline away
Drift off into other lives

The city, they shine their production
We've followed a contorted maze
Stacking the kingdom in rubble
Choking our failures again and again and again
Age defeats, age defiles
Your last breath tastes so sweet

We are not meant to survive here
We must move along
Calling unto our dwellings
We rot alone
We rot alone
We rot alone
We rot alone

Age defeats, age defiles
Your last breath tastes so sweet

We are not meant to survive here
We must move along
Calling unto our dwellings

Over and over
Day in, day out
Monotonous drought
We didn't live
We only existed

Over and over
Day in, day out
Monotonous drought
We didn't live
We only existed

// Fix The Error //

Break free from the maze!

Watch the distant fires
There's trust in what we've done
Our shallow grave of freedom
A new life that's just begun

I'm the fortune teller
Who doesn't know his past
Giving hope and new memories
To the future's rising sun

We're here to bring it down
Collapse society
We were born for this
It's time to celebrate
We're here to bring it down
Collapse society
We were born for this
It's time to celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate

Break free from the maze!

Doom-scroll past this frame of mind
The last of its kind
We now have come alive
The horror has ceased to be
The guest is now free
We are free

The mountain is rising
Fire blasts into the sea
A storm is coming
Red light
Dark room

If you see the rainbow, there is no tomorrow
It's wrapped in plastic
If you see the rainbow, there is no tomorrow
Put your face inside it

We're here to bring it down
Collapse society
We were born for this
It's time to celebrate
We're here to bring it down
Collapse society
We were born for this
It's time to celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate

// Never Seen / Future Shock //

Water drags
Water drags down
Dripping away your grime

Your secret lives
I'm on the outside
Your secret lives
The outside looking in

A silhouette dragging through your minds
Clean your well
Catch up every once in a while

Your secret lives
I'm on the outside
Your secret lives

The exterior world seeps in quicker than it used to
It all tends to catch up every once in a while
A collective theory of invisible destruction
Searching inward from the dangling lines

The exterior world seeps in quicker
Than it used to

Your fears and hopes, I take
We multiply
Embrace our own decay
The storm is coming...
We will never be at peace with ourselves
Until we separate ourselves

Your fears and hopes, I take
We multiply
Embrace our own decay
The storm is coming...
We will never be at peace with ourselves
Until we separate ourselves

I read your words
I smell your anxieties
Used to turn us against one another

A velvet room has a familiar smell
The shamed dirt spills against your walls
Beyond the looking glass

Watching and listening, plotting
I'll slither my way in and destroy from the inside
Beyond the looking glass

Clean it all away
Plotting and spinning
Clash with one another
Ravens used to speak like us
Peering in on the souls of Limbo City

The storm is coming
My storm is coming

Your secret lives
I'm on the outside
The outside looking in
Your fears and hopes, I take away
We multiply
We are driven by anger
Linked together through an irrational outlook

Lifelines are tethered in the blood of our eminent selves
You have it, we want it
I need it, you crave it
Give us more now

Our wills held against our complex truths
We are initially fed the same fears
Hooks in our backs, and impaled on the walls
Trapped in our geometric nests of not giving a fuck
We are initially fed the same fears
The ants on our backs, they have dropped from the sky

We will never be at peace with ourselves
Until we separate ourselves
Lift and corrode, the beginning of remembering
Make us whole
Our decisions will fix the story
We will never be at peace until we separate ourselves

Lift and corrode
The beginning

Fade as time marches on
Fade as time marches on

Your fears and hopes, I take
We multiply
Embrace our own decay
The storm is coming...
We will never be at peace with ourselves
Until we separate ourselves

Your fears and hopes, I take
We multiply
Embrace our own decay
The storm is coming...
We will never be at peace with ourselves
Until we separate ourselves

// Stare Into The Abyss //

Life is love
Time is never lost
Life is love
Let it go and collect
Seize these memories
We never regret
We never forget
The dream can wash away
We never regret
I'm so scared I'll forget

Time is never lost (Empty space)

Eyes turn away

Eyes turn away
Inside out
Into a space trained by your brain
It's never enough
It's never enough
You'll regret the wish
Let it go and collect your life before you die

Eyes turn away
Inside out
Into a space trained by your brain
It's never enough
It's never enough
You'll regret the wish
Let it go and collect your life before you die

Embrace these memories
We never regret

// Prehistory //

A rare delicacy
A dwindled spirit
Will we be forced to sing with the fear?

What will make it reinvent?
Will it end?
The first hearings
The moment everything changed

Creature feature
A monster on the big screen
Cinematic surprise
Entice the eyes
A hopeless murder

The notes that raised the brow
Sounds that brought back the dead
I'll just take my yearly dreamscape and pretend
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again

// Bad Habits //

These words (Will be the end of me)
These words (Bring a new life to me)

Stacked upon one another, yet I cannot grip
(I cannot grip)

These words (Render through a cosmic sea)
These words (Revoke our life to be)

Stacked upon one another, yet I cannot grip
(I cannot grip)

Contagion has shut
Down

Ground control to minor 3rds
Overtake and shed some sleep
Harmony loves tragedy in our own jeopardy

I cannot seem to say
Say what I need
They have my tongue
Let's cut it out

Can't speak over you
My words keep losing meaning
(Can't speak over you)
Maybe don't take it so serious
(My words keep losing meaning)
Three syllables to complete a thought

I get caught
Becoming lost
As words have quickly left me

The winds howl around their lost souls today
Stuck in a spectrum between the living and the dead
Their open mouths enter the worms of the living
Slither in and out

The winds howl around their lost souls today
Stagnant air lifts up the creature myth
Stuck between life and death
An order to connect and forget

Time is evaporating
Time is still

I cannot seem to say
Say what I need
They have my tongue
Let's cut it out

I cannot seem to say
Say what I need
They have my tongue
Let's cut it out

In order to connect and forget
Connect and forget
In order to connect and forget
Connect and forget

In order to connect and forget
Connect and forget
In order to connect and forget
Connect and forget

Sleep on, fly on (In order to)
In our minds (Connect and forget)
(Connect and forget) We can fly

Sleep on, fly on (In order to)
In our minds (Connect and forget)
(Connect and forget) We can fly

// The Future Is Behind Us //

Stuck in our last season
Bite off our headless fever

Drifting and melting
We hope you gravitate

Please don't wave back
I've severed (Once again) in transparency
Please just sit back
Devour (Once again) our broken disease

Kill the writer
Their eyes follow you
Open the closed off circle
Kill the writer
Their eyes follow us
Open the closed off circle

Sorry for the last week of bringing you down
My mind is to blame
My mind is to blame
What the fuck
Stuck in our last season
Bite off our headless fever

Dripping and melting
We hope you gravitate

Locked in a place of grief
I cannot find the proper balance
These odd rhythms, they are killing me
Yes, me and my brain
Drip and melt
Follow
I made it through

Sorry for the last month of bringing you down
My mind is to blame
My mind is to blame
What the fuck
Guilty memory
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Where's the bottom?
Keep falling

The future is behind our eyes
Annihilate cleansing
Disrupt
Erasing

The future is behind us

Born of a dream
I am
Born of a dream
We are lunatics

Open wide and let the pill slide down
Sink away from your nourishment

Sorry for the last year of bringing you down
My mind is to blame

// Turbulent //

Turbulent
We make it through
Weathered movement
Weathered movement
The clouds and storms
Weathered movement in time

We find ourselves
Turbulent

Get through this drab turbulence
The writer claims a scratching line

Keep up with it
A constant delay
A constant delay
Soon rectify
Accelerating the mind
Turbulent

Turbulent

Get through this
(Translate our own transmission)
Drab turbulence
(We've lived before and will once more)

The writer claims a scratching line
These ants will soon rectify

Sorry for the last week of bringing you down
(Get through this)
We make it through
My mind is to blame, my mind is to blame
(Drab turbulence)
The clouds and storms

The writer claims a scratching line
These ants will soon rectify our turbulence
Our turbulence
Get through this

Finding the calming path
Windless night into brighter lights
We find ourselves
We find ourselves

Their eyes follow you
Open the closed off circle
Their eyes follow us
Open the closed off circle

// Human Is Hell (Another One With Love) //

I hope I'm still here when you, you read this
I'm not the writer, but I've become the movement
That tore out my needs
I beg for the performance, and I never thought I would
The dark water
The horrid swells

The heart pounding stroll that opens a box
That always hid deep beneath my scattered eyes
I beg for the performance, and I never thought I would
The dark water
The horrid swells

Human is hell
I've tried to overcome this
Their hands keep dragging me down this hill
Human is hell
It seems to be miles long, years long
But we will "break on through" as he once said

Looking over the horizon
I realize that this is irrelevant
This is a small blip in the spectrum of our lives

Life
Human is hell, love is heaven
Life
God is sound and the sound still flows
Praise the uncertainty and collective brain
Life

Human is hell
Human is hell
Human is hell and we are accepting
Human is hell

Group initiation to help ourselves
(Mentally, telepathically)
"Sometimes I wish I was dead," is what was said
(Mentally, telepathically)
I realized the words came from my head
(Mentally, telepathically)
We are not meant to survive here
(Mentally, telepathically)
Leave your worries and your memories are not invited

Praise the uncertainty and collective brain
Brain
Collective brain
Brain
Grab my hand and we will see the future
Admiring the sanity that keeps us human
The day dissolved
With bleak reasonings and wretched smiles
Admiring the sanity that keeps us human
The day dissolved
With bleak reasonings and wretched smiles

Breathe in fresh air as nature keeps warning us

Never take this for granted
We have destroyed and we will pay
For what we have done
Human is hell

The air has been smoke, and the sun hides
As if its somber, somber reflection could not face
Could not face
What we have achieved
What we have achieved
Destruction
Abomination
It's in our wiring
It's in our wiring

Giving new life to the apparatus
I hope I'm still here when you read this

I'm not the writer
I've done nothing, nothing with time

A viewing glass so divine
A viewing glass so divine
A viewing glass so divine
So divine
Entwined in a fountain of evaporated youth

Admiring the sanity that keeps us human
The day dissolved

Sing with me, for today is gone
It's gone
Sing with me, for today is gone
It's gone
It's gone
