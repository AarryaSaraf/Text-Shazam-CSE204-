I'vee been down hearted
Ever since the day we met 
Baby I've been down hearted
Ever since the day we met 
Our love is nothing but the blues 
Baby, how blue can you get? 

My love burned like a fire
Your love burned like a cigarette
Yes my love burned like a fire
Your love burned like a cigarette
Yes I've seen you put it down and crush it
Baby, how blue can you get? 

Oh you're evil when I'm with you, baby 
And you're jealous when we're apart 
Yes you're evil when I'm with you, baby 
And you're jealous when we're apart 
How blue can you get baby 
The answer's right here in my heart 

I gave you a brand new Ford 
But you said: I want a Cadillac 
I bought you a ten dollar dinner 
And you said: thanks for the snack 
I let you live in my pent house 
You said it just a shack 

I gave you seven children 
And now you wanna give them back 
I said I've been down hearted baby 
Ever since the day we met 
Our love is nothing but the blues 
Tell me how blue can you get?
