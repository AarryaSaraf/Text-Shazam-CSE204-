Do I have to have sleepless nights?
Do my days have to be so blue?
Do I have to have sleepless nights?
Do my days have to be so blue?
Will I have to suffer for the rest of my life?
Just because I'm so in love with you.

Will the sun have to shine
In this poor heart of mine?
Will the sun have to shine
In this poor heart of mine?
Or will it just keep on rainin'
Will it just keep on rainin' all the time?

The nights in my lonely room
I wake up from my sleep just to cry.
The nights in my lonely room
I wake up from my sleep just to cry.
You know I'll be thinking about you, baby
Every night about this time.

The people think I'm crazy
Think I don't have too much to say.
The people think I'm crazy
Think I don't have too much to say.
But you'll never know how I feel, people
Until you've been hurt this way.
