Well I hate to see the sun sets in the West
'Cos I know my whole life gonna be a solid mess
I got to find my baby I declare well I
I ain't had no real good lovin' since my gal said goodbye

Well, I walked this town from door to door
Gal I love can't find no more
I got to find my baby I declare well I
I ain't had no real good lovin' since my gal said goodbye

Well I've looked all around trying to find me a wife
I got to find my big legged brownskin share the rest of my life
I got to find my baby I declare well I
I ain't had no real good lovin' since my gal said goodbye
