I don't know what love is
But I think I must have it bad
Yeah, you know I don't know what love is people
Woah, but I think I must have it bad
Yeah, you know some people say love is just a gamble
But whatever it is, it's enough to drive old B. mad
They say love is just a proposition people
It's strictly a game of give and take
Yeah, they tell me love, love, love is a proposition people
They say it's strictly a game of give and take
Woah, but my woman took all I gave her
And I'm here to tell to you that love proposition stuff's a fake

Oh, I don't claim to be no gambler people
Oh, I don't know much about the dice
Yes, I don't claim to be no gambler people
I tell you I don't know much about the dice
Oh, but I wait and my baby knows
She knows I'm not the kind that's gonna crap out twice

Yes, she left me early this mornin'
I don't know the reason why
She just got up early this mornin'
Didn't even say goodbye

But I love you, I love you, you know I love you, baby
Although you made me cry
Yes, there are a lot of women who want me
Oh, but how you satisfy?
