You never treated me gentle
Yet you spend up all of my gold
Then you look around for a young man
Tell me I'm too old
That's why we can't agree
Yeah, baby, we can't agree

Now if I don't see you no more, baby
It'll be way too soon for me
You're known for being a lover
You like to holler loud
One man for you ain't nothing
You talk so loud you draw a crowd
That's why we can't agree
Yes, baby, we can't agree
Now if I don't see you no more, baby
It'll be way too soon for me

You're used to eating hot dogs
When you go out to dine
I taught you what a steak was
And now you've almost lost your mind
That's why we can't agree
Yes, baby, we can't agree
Now if I don't see you no more, baby
Honey, that'll be way too soon for me
You know it will

Now your clothes look like a sifter
Because they had so many holes
You know we both
Came from the ghetto, baby
And everybody knows
We can't agree
Yes, baby, we can't agree
Now if I don't see you
No more, little woman
Honey, it'll be way too soon for me
Yes, it will

Another one of them crazy endings.
That's the only way I could get out of it.
