Hold that train, conductor
Please don't let that engineer start
Hold that train, conductor
Please don't let that engineer start
Well, I wanna ride your train this morning
Just to ease my achin' heart

Yes, for the last few mornings lately
Before I get out of my bed
Yes, for the last few mornings lately
Before I get out of my bed
Well, I hear your whistle moanin' 
And it almost drives me out of my head

I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin'
All your money's right here in my pants
I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin'
All your money's right here in my pants
Well, I know I should back and buy a ticket
Yes, but I'm afraid to take the chance

Oh, don't stop this train, conductor
Till this old state is out of sight
Yes, don't stop this train, conductor
Till Mississippi is out of sight
Well, you know I'm going to California
Where I, I know my baby will treat me right
