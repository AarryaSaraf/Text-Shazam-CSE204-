Well, my baby don't have to work
And she don't have to rob and steal
Well, my baby don't have to work
And she don't have to rob and steal
Yes, I'll give her everything she needs
'Cause I am her driving wheel

Yes, she left me this morning
And she said she'd be back soon
Yes, she left me this morning
And she said she'd be back soon
Yes, she would be back early Friday mornin'
Or laid over Saturday afternoon

Yes, every time she walk
She shakes like a leaf tremblin' on a tree
Yes, when my baby walk down the street
She shakes like a leaf tremblin' on a tree
Yes, the women all hate her
But man, she's alright with me

Wo, I sent the U.N. a telegram
Don't want nobody else to break the seal
Wo, I sent the U.N. a telegram
Don't want nobody else to break the seal
I want the whole world to know
That I am my baby's driving wheel
