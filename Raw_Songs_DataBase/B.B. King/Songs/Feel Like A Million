I've got a real fine woman and she gives me everything
I've got a real fine woman and she gives me everything
It just makes me feel so good just to hear my baby call my name

My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I could sing
My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I wanna sing
Yes, I feel just like a millionaire
When I hear my baby call my name

Yes, there ain't nobody like my baby
That's the reason I love her so
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody like my woman
That's the reason I love her so
Yes, I would even die for her and I want the whole world to know

Yes, when I'm down she'll pick me up
And tell me "Daddy you can't lose"
Yes, when I'm down, when I'm down, when I'm down, people
My baby tell me I can't lose
Yes, when all of my friends forget about me
My baby keeps away these blues
