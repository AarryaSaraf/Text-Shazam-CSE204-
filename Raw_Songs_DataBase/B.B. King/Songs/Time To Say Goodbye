There was a time when I loved you
That was a time, babe, you made me blue
There's a time ev'rything must end,
So now it's time to say we're through

Remember the time, the time you made me cry,
But now, baby, you break my heart
They say there's a time for everything, baby,
So now it's time we must part

Remember the time, baby, you made me cry,
And the time, baby, when you broke my heart
But there's a time for everything, baby,
So now it's time we must part

They say that time brings about change,
And I know, baby, I know it is no lie
There's times I got to forget you, baby,
So it's time to say goodbye
