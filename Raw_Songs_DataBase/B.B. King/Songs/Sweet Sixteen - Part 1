When I first met you, baby 
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen 
When I first met you, baby 
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen 
You just left your home then, woman 
Ah, the sweetest thing I'd ever seen 

But you wouldn't do nothing, baby 
You wouldn't do anything I asked to 
You wouldn't do nothing for me, baby 
You wouldn't do anything I asked to 
You know you ran away from your home, baby 
And now you wanna run away from old B. too 

You know I loved you, baby 
I loved you before I could call your name 
You know I loved you, baby 
Baby I loved you, I love you before I could call your name 
Well, it seems like everything I do now baby 
Everything I do is in vain 

My brother's in Korea, baby 
My sister's down in New Orleans 
Brother's in Korea baby 
My sister's down in New Orleans 
You know I'm having so much trouble woman 
Baby, I wonder, what in the world is gonna happen to me
