Well hello pretty baby
I just called to say that we're through
Because I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

I want to meet you in the sunlight
Not in a secret rendezvous
Because I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

Oh you never, you're never meant to be mine
I was just too blind to see
Oh but I've got my pride, so why should we hide
When you might as well be free

Oh I love, you know I love you
Oh, and I want to tell the world I do
That's why I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Oh I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Oh, I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
