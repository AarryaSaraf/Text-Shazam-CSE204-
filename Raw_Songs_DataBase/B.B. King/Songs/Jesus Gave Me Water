Came to get some water
There she met a stranger, Lord
Who did a story tell

From the water, Lord
Was not from the well

Hey, so on that woman, He had pity
She ran back to the city
Crying, "Glory, Hallelujah"
And did His wonders tell

Yeah, she left my Savior singing
And she came back to Him bringing
Yeah, the water, Lord
That was not from the well

Hey, Jesus

Yes, that woman left a shouting
There was no room for doubting
That she had met a Savior
Who did her wonders tell

Yes, every time she doubted Lord
She started to think about Him
The man that gave her water, Lord
And it was not from the well
