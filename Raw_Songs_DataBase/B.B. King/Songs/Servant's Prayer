O lord I, I will serve You
I will serve You everyday
All my life I, I will praise You
Hear me calling now I pray

I will worship You only
Now I bow before Your throne Lord
Holy Father hear me calling
This is Your servant's prayer, Lord

When I'm sad You make me happy
Keep me safe from hurt and harm
When I'm burdened or I'm lonely
Comfort me within Your arms

Never leave me, ever keep me
You I'll follow anywhere Lord
Holy Father hear me calling
This is Your servant's prayer Lord

I give to You my life
My all I give to Thee
O Lord receive my offering today
This is Your servant's prayer

You gave to me Your love
Your son at Calvary
O Lord receive my Offering today
This is Your servant's prayer
