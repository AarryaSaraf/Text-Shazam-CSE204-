When I first met you baby
Honey you were almost out of school
When I first met you baby
Honey you were almost out of school
You were real wild then woman
Honey, but you were nobody's fool

I was so in love with you baby
And I tried to get you to love me too
I was so in love with you baby
And I tried to get you to love me too
I thought you had no time for me then woman
Wouldn't do anything I asked to

Oh, sweet thing
You are all I want to see
Oh, sweet thing
You are all I want to see
I having so much trouble baby
I wonder what's gonna happen to me
