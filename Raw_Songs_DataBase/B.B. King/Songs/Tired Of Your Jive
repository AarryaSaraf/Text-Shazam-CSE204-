You're sittin' there lookin' proud, thinkin' you're so fine
Tryin' to run around with every friend of mine
Think you're so smart baby, think that I'm a fool
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you baby you'd better play it cool
I'm tired of your jive. yeah, baby I'm tired of your jive
I refuse to be your fool mama, hey, I'm tired of your jive

You think that I don't see what you do behind my back
You think I outta love you baby, no matter how you act
You'll never miss your water baby, till the world goes dry

I'm gonna tell you, gonna miss me, bye bye
I'm tired of your jive, yeah baby I'm tired of your jive
I refuse to be your fool mama, hey I'm tired of your jive

Sittin' there smilin', like nothing's wrong
I don't intend to pull your coat baby, you'll know it when I'm gone
You'll never miss your water baby, till the world run dry
Now I'm gonna tell you, gonna miss me, bye bye
I'm tired of your jive, baby I'm tired of your jive
Yes, I'm here to tell you woman, baby I'm tired of your jive
