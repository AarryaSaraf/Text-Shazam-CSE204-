Learn to love or leave me
Either one you wanna do
Learn to love or leave me
Either one you wanna do
Because strange things are happening 
And something may happen to you

Well, if you know you don't want me baby
Why in the world would you let me be
Yes if you know you don't want me baby
Tell me why would you let me be
Because it's better to live without you baby
Than to live on in misery

Yeah, midnight finds me crying
Oh daylight finds me crying too
Yes midnight finds me crying
Daylight finds me crying too
You better straighten your mind pretty baby
Because something may happen to you
