When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me why did you walk away
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me why did you walk away
Can't believe that you don't love me
Thought our love was here to stay

Now buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me
Buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
If you forgot the number
Come on over
You won't have to call at all

I never lied to no one
I ain't gonna lie to you
When I say I'm yours forever
Every word I say is true
Buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
If you forgot the number
Come on over
You won't have to call at all

Yes, buzz me, baby
I'm like the ship that's lost at sea
Buzz me, buzz me, baby
You mean so much to me
If I ever get my arms around you
I ain't gonna let go till 1973
