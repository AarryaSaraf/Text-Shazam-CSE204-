I said your letter reached me early this morning baby 
and I read every word you had to say 
But you know I just don't understand you waman 
If you love me why in the world did you go away

Your letter said that you're doing ok
But then it read: "Please, let me come back home." 
Your letter said that you're doing ok
But then it read: "Please, let me come back home." 
Yes, you said you were so tired, so tired baby 
And you wanted someone you could call your own 

But memories don't fail me woman 
I remember the day you left 
Oh my memories don't fail me baby
I remember the day you left 
Well you know you told me then and I believe you now woman 
That you were grown and you've been take care of yourself 

So now here is my answer baby 
And the words come straight from my heart 
Well, here is the answer to you letter woman
And the words come straight from my heart 
Yeah it's against my will I know
I could love you still baby
But baby I just can't play the part
