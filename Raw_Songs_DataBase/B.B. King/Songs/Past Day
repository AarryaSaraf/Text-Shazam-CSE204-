Well, this past day, darlin'
I don't have to cry no more
Well, this past day, darlin'
I don't have to cry no more
Well, I found my baby
Don't have to walk from door to door

Well, I look around me
Lord, my baby can't be found
Well, I look around me
Lord, my baby can't be found
Well, I don't have to walk around no more
Don't have to go down to the bowlin' ground

Oh, I'm sayin' goodbye
Well, I don't say goodbye no more
Oh, I'm sayin' goodbye
Well, I don't say goodbye no more
Well, I found my baby
Don't have to walk from door to door
