Chains of love have tied my heart to you
Chains of love have made me feel so blue
Well, now I'm just a prisoner
Tell me what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna make me cry?
Are you gonna love me?
Are you gonna make me cry?
These chains of blues gonna haunt me
Until the day I die

Well, if you're gonna leave me
Please won't you set me free?
Well, if you're gonna leave me
Please won't you set me free?
I can't stay here with these chains
Unless you gonna stay right here with me

It's three o'clock in the morning, baby
And the moon is shining bright
Yes, it's three o'clock in the morning
And the moon is shining bright
I'm just sittin' here wonderin'
Where can you be tonight?
