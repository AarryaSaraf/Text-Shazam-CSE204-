What do you want on your ring
I'm a pawnbroker
What do you want on your ring
See like every woman I loaned
They want the same old thing

Have to use my tester
And see if will stand the test
Have to use my tester
And see if will stand the test
Yes, I'm a ring pawnbroker
Don't have nothing but the best

18 carat is OK
But 14 carat will make the grade
18 carat is OK
But 14 carat will make the grade
Yes, I'm a ring pawnbroker
Don't have nothing but the best that's made

Yes, I'm a payin' pawnbroker
I pay the best price in town
Yes, I'm a payin' pawnbroker
I pay the best price in town
Well, if you don't believe me
Baby, just lay your ring down

Yes, you may need money, baby
On your ring some day
Yes, you may need money, baby
On your ring some day
Well, you can't ever tell
What bad luck may come your way
