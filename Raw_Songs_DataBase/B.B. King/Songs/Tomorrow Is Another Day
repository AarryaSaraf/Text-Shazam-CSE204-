I was trying to be true to you baby
Trying to please you in every way
Yes, but the more I try to please you baby
The further you stray away
Yes, but I know you're gonna miss me baby
Cause tomorrow is another day

Yes, it was just last night baby
When you walked out my door
Yes, you said you didn't want me baby
Said you didn't love me no more
Yes, I'm beggin' you please don't leave me baby
Cause tomorrow is another day

Yes, they say life is a gamble
And you never know what tomorrow may bring
Yes, they say life is a gamble
And you never know what tomorrow may bring
Well I took all of my chances on you baby
Yes, you know I lost everything
