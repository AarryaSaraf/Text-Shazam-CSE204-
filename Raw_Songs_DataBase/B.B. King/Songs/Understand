I've traveled from town to town
Seems like everybody wanna throw me down
'Cause I'm a poor man
But I'm a good man, understand

I went down to the train station
Looked up on the wall
My money was too light, baby
Couldn't go nowhere at all
'Cause I'm a poor man
But I'm a good man, understand

The burden that I carry is so heavy, you see
It seems like there ain't nobody in this world
Who would wanna help poor me

Well, I would be all right, baby
Just give me a break
Good things come to those who wait
'Cause I've been a good man
But I'm a poor man, understand
