Oh no matter what you say baby
No matter what you do
The way you've been treating me woman
Is coming back home to you
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you baby
Oh, crying won't help you woman
'Cause you've been so mean to me

Oh, you must remember baby
No matter where you go
Watch those seeds just scatter woman
Because you're gonna reap just what you sow
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you baby
'Cause you been so mean to me

Oh, the way you've been treating me woman
Just can't understand
Oh, I'm gonna leave you woman
Let you do the best you can
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you woman
'Cause you been so mean to me
Look out!

Oh, just before I leave you woman
Just before I shake your hand
I'm gonna get me a woman baby
Not to get your mad
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you baby
'Cause you been so mean to me
