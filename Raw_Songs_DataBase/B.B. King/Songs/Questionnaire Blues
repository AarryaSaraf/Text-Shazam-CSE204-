I've got my questionaire
Aand they need me in the war
I've got my questionaire
Aand they need me in the war
Yes, if I have to commit murder
Won't have to (???)

I want the thirty two-twenty
Made on a forty-five frame
I want the thirty two-twenty
Made on a forty-five frame
And a red, white and blue fag
Wear it in my right hand

Yeah, you can tell my baby
Tell her to please wait for me
Yeah, you can tell my baby
Tell her to please wait for me
Well I meet her one mornin'
Down by that old Red Sea
