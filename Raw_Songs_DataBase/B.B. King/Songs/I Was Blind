I was blind and I could not see
That you were gettin' away from me
But now I know that you are gone

I live by the night
And slumber through the day
Because life don't seem worth livin' anyway

If I could only see 
Life would be so miserable to me
Tell me why my love want leave me in misery

Oh, now I haven't be true
But this one I want to be my wife
So baby please, please think of you and me

If I could only see 
Life would be so miserable to me
Why would the one I love want to leave me in misery

Oh, haven't been true all of my life
Ah, but this one I want, want her to be my wife
So baby please, baby please think of you and me
