Tomorrow night, will you remember what you said tonight?
Tomorrow night, will all the thrill be gone?
Tomorrow night, will this be just another memory?
Or just another lovely song that's in my heart to linger on?
Tonight, your lips are tender, your heart, your heart is beating fast
And you're willing, willingly surrender, oh, tell me darling, will it last?
Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright?
And will you say those lovely things you said tonight?

Tonight, your lips are tender, your heart, your heart is beating fast
And you willingly, willingly surrender, oh, tell me darling, will it last? 
Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright?
And will you say all the lovely things you said tonight?
