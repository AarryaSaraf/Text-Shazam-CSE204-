When I first met you, said you would be mine
Found out later you was tellin' me a lie
And now I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

Now if there's one thing that I just can't stand
Can't stand to see you with another man
Because I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

I did all for you, did all I could
All I did darlin', it didn't do me no good
And now I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

Now I'm goin' on, goin' on my way
I know you don't love me now darlin'
But you will some old day
Because I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more
