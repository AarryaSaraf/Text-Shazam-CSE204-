Sometimes
I got worried wo, ho
I don't know what to do
Because the women that I'm loving
Is breaking my heart in two

I remember way back
When all the money
The money was rolling in
My women was good to me
And I had a lot of friends

Oh, but now I'm getting older
Whoa and the money
The money it's coming in slow
And now that women she put me
I'm not wanted anymore

Yeah, my women, my women
Doesn't want me
I'm not wanted, not wanted anymore
