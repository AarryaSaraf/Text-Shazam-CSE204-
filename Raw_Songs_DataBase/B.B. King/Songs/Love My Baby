I've got a right to love my baby
She treats me just like a king
I've got a right to love my woman
She treats me just like a king
Yes, she's my mind, body and soul
Yes, my baby, she can do 'most anything

Yes, she's my doctor when I'm sick, people
She's my all-around standby
Oh, she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble, people
She's my mother when I wanna cry
Yes, I've got a right to love my baby
Oh, can't you see the reason why?

Oh, that gives me the right to love my woman
She's always here by my side
Oh, my sweet understanding baby
She makes my temperature rise
Yes and when it comes to kind treating people
My baby's an angel in disguise

Oh, when I'm sick she is my doctor
When I'm well she's my pride and joy
Yes, when I'm cold she's my cover
Yes, she calls me her little baby boy
Yes, when I'm tired and wanna play, people
It's my baby that's my toy
