Right now, right now, now, baby
Right now, right now's the time
Right now, right now, darlin'
I can change my mind
Right now, I'm realin' and rockin'
I'm spinnin' just like a queen
You'd better have me right now
I don't know how I'll feel
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now's the time
You right now, right now, darlin'
I can change my mind
Six month, six month same old sentence
Twelve month won't be long time
To get what you want to me
Have to do I to 99
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now's the time
Right now, right now, baby
Don't you know Brownie can change my mind
Right now, my card's on the table
I maybe playin' a loosin' hand
But I'd rather drink muddy water
T' see you with another man
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, darlin', here's the time
Right now, right now
Baby, I can change my mind
Right now, right now, my cup runs over
Well, the whole lotta love for you
Right now, if I was in your shoes
I'd do anything you want me to
Right now, right now, now, baby
Right now, right now's the time
Right now, you'd better have me
Cause I can change my mind
Right now, let's go out together, right now
