Long about sundown, I've gotta be on my way 
Sad long about sundown, I've gotta be on my way 
Goin' back to my woman and this time I'm gonna stay  
Yes, I've been gone for a long time 
Wonder if I'm welcome home 
Wonder if I'm welcome home 
Been gone for a long time 
So many things can happen  
When a man leaves his baby all alone 
Yes, it took a long time, baby 
When I knock on the door 
To realise what a fool I've been 
Well, I said it took a long, long time, baby 
To realise what a fool I've been 
I wonder will she let me in
