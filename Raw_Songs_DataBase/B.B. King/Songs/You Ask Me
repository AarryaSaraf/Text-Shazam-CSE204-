Yes, you ask me
If I love you
If I'm true to you, each day
Well darling, if I didn't love you
Why would I be this why way

Oh, you ask me
If our love will die
Or will it forever grow
Well, I love you, yes darling, I love you
More than you'll ever know

Oh, I'm on my knees
I'm begging you, please
Oh, to ease my worried mind
Can't you see
Can't you see, pretty baby, what you mean to me
Love is so hard to find

Yes, you ask me
To prove my love
Oh, and everything I say and do
Yes, believe me, please believe me
I'll never love no one but you
Oh, I'll never love, never love, never love no one but you
