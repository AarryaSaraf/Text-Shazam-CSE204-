Troubles, trouble, troubles, troubles is all in the world I see 
Troubles, trouble, troubles, troubles is all in the world I see 
Oh sometimes I wonder, wonder what is gonna become of me 

When I wake up early in the mornin', blues and troubles all around my bed 
Oh when I wake up early in the mornin', blues and troubles all around my bed 
Oh I never will forget people, the last words I heard my baby said 

She said I'm leavin' you in the mornin', BB and cryin' won't make me stay 
She said I'm leavin' you in the mornin', BB and your cryin' won't make me stay 
Ah the more you cry honey, the farther you're goin' to drive me away 

Oh if you just got to go baby, I hope you will come back one day 
Oh yes if you just got to go baby, please come on back some day 
Oh but I never will forget baby, baby the way we used to love and play
