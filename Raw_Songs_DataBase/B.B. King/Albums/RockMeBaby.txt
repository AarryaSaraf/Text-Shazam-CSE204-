// Got 'em Bad //

There's no doubt about it
A may as well shout about it
I got the blues 
I got'em bad

Yes this awful feeling
When you don't have what you thought you had
Oh yesterday, yesterday I sang love songs
But today I got'em bad

Oh, I didn't know she would leave me
I didn't know she was gone
Well, at last she should've told me goodbye people
But she stole away while I was gone
Yes that's what makes me feel so sad people
Oh, and today I got'em bad

Oh, I could tell you much more people
But I think you already how I feel
Oh, I could tell you much, much, much more people
But I think you already how I feel
Yes, you know I'm hurt beyond explaining people
And it's all because I've got a dirty deal

// Eyesight To The Blind //

Yes your talkin' about your woman 
Wish to god, man, you could see mine 
Your talkin'about your woman 
Wish to god, man, you could see mine 
When she start lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind 

Her daddy must have been a millionaire 
I can tell by the way she walks 
My baby's daddy must have been a millionaire 
I can tell by the way she walks 
When she start walkin'
The deaf and dumb begin to talk 

I remember one Friday morning 
We were layin' down across the bed 
Man was in the next room dyin'
Knelt down and raised up his head 
And said ain't she pretty 
The world know she's fine 
She start lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind 

Hey, I declare my baby's pretty
The whole state knows she's fine
Oh, I declare my baby's pretty
The whole state knows she's fine
Oh, when she starts lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind

// Rock Me Baby //

Rock me baby, rock me all night long
Rock me baby, honey, rock me all night long
I want you to rock me baby,
Like my back ain't got no bones

Roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
I want you to roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
Want you to roll me baby,
You don't know how it makes me feel

Rock me baby, honey, rock me slow
Yeah, rock me pretty baby, baby rock me slow
Want you to rock me baby,
Till I want no more

// Worst Thing In My Life //

Yes, it was the worst thing in my life, the worst thing I ever witnessed to
Yes, it was the worst thing in my life, the worst thing I ever witnessed to
When the woman that I loved, when she said we were really through

Take it easy baby, lots of things come before we part
Take it easy baby, lots of things come before we part
Yes, lots of those little things you're doing
I want to know if you're doing them, because you think you're so smart

I don't say that you won't leave me, but think of the shape you'll be in
I don't say that you won't leave me, but think of the shape you'll be in
I want to know you'll hate that you ever met me, and you'll hate the day that we began

Why should you 'cuse me, baby, without me giving you a cause
Why should you 'cuse me, baby, without me giving you a cause
I know I've been good to you, baby, as if I was a Santa Claus

You don't think much of your life, to put yourself in a spot
You don't think much of your life, to put yourself in a spot
When the people see me clowning, they all wonder what you got

// Beautician Blues //

I met a fine beautician
In a very fine condition
She was long and lean
And you know what that means
She's a good lovin' mama
A hard workin' woman
She makes a lot of money
I don't have to worry about a thing

She works hard all day
Dressin' hair
Man you can bet
I want to get somewhere
With my good lovin' mama
My hard workin' woman
She makes a lot of money
I don't have to worry about a thing

I meet the finest woman
From everywhere
Because my baby
Dress their hair
I'll be her lover boy
She treats me like a king
She makes a lot of money
Don't have to worry about a thing

Yes, she keeps her hair
So neat and fine
And every pound of her is mine
I'll be her lover boy
I'll be happy as a king
She makes a lot of money
Don't have to worry about a thing

// Blues Stay Away From Me //

Blues stay away from me
Oh blues, why don't you let me be
Don't know why
You keep on haunting me

Love was never meant for me
Oh true love was never meant for me
Seem somehow
We never can agree

Life is full of misery
Oh dreams are like memories
Bringing back 
The love that it used to be

Tears, so many I can't see
Oh yes, don't mean a thing to me
Oh, don't go by
Still I can be free

// Jungle //

I may go and move to the jungle now
Way out in the woods
Yes, I think I'll move to the jungle people
Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now
Well, I ain't doin' myself no good
I work hard everyday
From Monday to Friday night

The wages that they pay me
I swear that they're very light
The take out a little for the state
A little more for Uncle Sam

How can I ever catch up
And get myself out of this jam
Yes, I think I'll move to the jungle
Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now
Well, I ain't doin' myself no good
I go to town on Saturday
Just to pay my bills

I better make it early
Or the collector will come where I live
I got to church on a Sunday
I get on my knees to pray

Preacher takes up collection
And say brother what will you pay
I think I'll move to the jungle
Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now
Well, I ain't doin' myself no good

// It's A Mean World //

This is a mean old world, baby to live in all by yourself
Yes it's a mean old world, baby to live in all by yourself
Yes, you can't get the woman you love and you have to put up with somebody else

Baby, I smile to keep from worryin' and I laugh just to keep from cryin'
Oh I smile to keep from worryin', baby and I laugh just to keep from cryin'

Well, that's to keep the public for knowin' what I got on my mind

Yes, someday baby, when the blood runs cold in my vein
Yes, someday baby, when the blood runs cold in my vein
Well, I hope You'll around by here to mistreat me baby, 'cause my heart it feel no pain

// I Stay In The Mood //

Yeah, I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself
Yeah, I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself
You've always fooling around, givin' my love to somebody else

Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I go
Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I go

Well, if something soon don't happen, my heart is gonna break I know

Well, you said that you love me, you've sworn that you'll be true
But now you're tellin' stronger, that I'm just a fool you know
But I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself
Please come back to me baby, 'cause I'm tired of livin' by myself

// I Can Hear My Name //

I can hear my name ringin', ringin' all up and down the line
Yes I can hear my name ringin', ringin' all up and down the line
I don't believe my woman loves me, I believe I'm just messin' up my time

Yes, I have the blues before sunrise, with the tears gettin' to my eyes
I have the blues before sunrise and the tears gettin' to my eyes
Yes, I get that funny feeling, it's the feeling I do despise

Yes, last night as I laid there dreamin', I was layin' there by myself
Yes, last night as I laid dreamin', I was layin' there by myself
I was just thinkin' if my woman don't love me, I hope she's not in love with nobody else
