// Bad Luck Soul //

I want to go home but I ain't got sufficient clothes
Doggone my bad luck soul
I ain't got no money and my job's done closed
I would call that old woman but I'm afraid that she may explode

My wife done quit me, my girlfriend too
Doggone my bad luck soul
I ain't got nobody and I don't know what to do
They say things will get better but I don't believe it's true

I thought I had friends but they all disappeared
Doggone my bad luck soul
Everything I do people, everything I do seems to be wrong
It wouldn't be so bad if I knew I had a home

// Get Out Of Here //

Here is somethin' baby, I want you to do
I ain't barrin' nobody baby, I mean you and your lyin' friends too
Don't cry baby, don't even spill a tear
Yes, you just pack your clothes baby,
Baby and get on outta here

I gave you a chance and that you know,
You got greedy and thirsty baby and you spent more and more
There's no need cryin' baby, don't even spill a tear,
You just pack your clothes baby, baby and get on outta here

You and your friends you say you had fun,
You went every place woman, that you wanted to go
And when I tried to talk to you baby,
You didn't listen to a word I say
And now baby you must be crazier, that juice has gone to your head
Ain't no need of cryin' woman, baby, don't even spill a tear
You just pack your clothes baby,
I mean and get on outta here

// Bad Case Of Love //

I got a bad case of love
I got a bad case of love
I got a bad case of love
I got a bad case of love
I got a bad case of love
People, my heart is filled with misery

I live in loneliness, never get no rest
Went to see a love doctor to get out of this mess
Took a look at me before he cast his spell
Shook his head, then began to yell

You got a bad case of love
You got a bad case of love
You got a bad case of love
Boy, your heart is filled with misery

I said, "Doctor, doctor, please do something for me
I feel like a man going through the third degree
Can't sleep at night, can't eat a bite
Since she been gone nothing ever goes right"

He said, "Son, I know just how you feel
You love your baby and you always will
But your wind is short, your pulse is weak
It won't be long before you're six feet deep"

You got a bad case of love
You got a bad case of love
You got a bad case of love
Boy, your heart is filled with misery

// You're Breaking My Heart //

You're breakin' my heart baby,
and there ain't a damn thing I can do
Yes, you got me wringin' my hands and cryin' baby,
well, you're breakin' my heart in two
Well, it's not easy for me to believe woman,
that you are doin' the things you do

Well, it's so hard for me to believe baby,
it's hard for me to believe you would do me wrong
Yes, please have mercy baby,
won't you stay here where you belong?
Well you know I got the blues
I got the blues so bad now baby
Sometimes you make me wish,
make me wish I'd never, never been born

Yes, I want to know why did you let me,
why did you let me love you so long baby?
Why did you use me like a tool?
Yes, you played a game with my heart woman,
baby you know you used the devils rule

// My Reward //

If this is my reward
For being in love with you
A heart that's full of pain
And disappointment too
If this is what I get
Because my love was true
I know I'll never love again

Am I supposed to cry
And always be alone?
Am I supposed to suffer
'Cause my love was strong?
Well if this is my reward
Then something must be wrong
And I know that I'll never love again

How can I look forward tomorrow?
My tomorrow is just in vain
Yes, if I don't win your love, baby
I'll get my heart back
Then I'll always
Always have to stay this way

I remember when you said your love was mine
You said it would be safe to love you all the time
But the joke is on me sweetheart
'Cause you were only lyin'
And I know that I'll never love again
I'll never love again

// Shut Your Mouth //

I work hard everyday
Do the same at night
But still my baby
Ain't treating me right

Tell me baby baby baby baby
What can I do?
Do I have to shut your mouth
Just to get along with you?

When I'm home at night
I can't read a book
Without you being huffed up
Giving me a dirty look

Tell me baby baby baby baby
What can I do?
Do I have to shut your mouth
Just to get along with you?

She's so jealous, man
Till it's a sin
She don't even trust me
Out with men

Tell me baby baby baby baby
What can I do?
Do I have to shut your mouth
Just to get along with you?

// Just Like A Woman //

There was Adam, happy as a man could be
Till Eve got him messin' with that old apple tree

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

Lot took his wife down to the corner for a malted
She wouldn't mind her business, boy, did she get salted

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
Samson thought Delilah was on the square
Till one night she clipped him all his hair

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

From our history books we all learned
Nero fiddled while Rome was burned

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

Marie Antoinette met some hungry cats at the gate
They was crying for bread, she said, "Let them eat cake"

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

You can buy a woman clothes
And give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

// Baby, Look At You //

Well, baby, baby, baby look at you
Yes, I said baby, baby, baby, baby look at you
Well, you want to jump on me and hurt me
'Cos I won't let you tell me what to do

Well, when I first met you baby
You didn't know what love is about
You were standin' on the streets beggin'
And ragged as a barrel of sauerkraut

Baby, baby, baby look at you
Well now, you want to jump on me and hurt me
'Cos I won't let you tell me what to do

Well, you said once that you loved me
I would always be your own
And now you got your hands on some money, baby
And you're drivin' B.B. away from home

Well, you said that you loved me
I always would be your man
Now you thrown me outdoors
And said "Go and do the best you can"
