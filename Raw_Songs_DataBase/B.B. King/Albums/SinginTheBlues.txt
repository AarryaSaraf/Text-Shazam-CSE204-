// Please Love Me //

I've been in love with you baby
Honey before I learned to call your name
Yes, I was in love with you baby
Honey before I learned to call your name
Yeah, the way you treatin' me baby
Honey you gonna drive old me insane

Yeah, you know I love you
I'll do anything you tell me to
Yeah, you know I love you baby
And I'll do anything you tell me to
Well there's nothing in this world baby
Honey that I wouldn't do for you

Well if you love me baby
Honey do everything I say
Yeah, if you love me baby
Honey do everything I say
Yes, if you don't do what I tell you
You better get on your knees and pray

Well, I want you to be my girlfriend 
Baby I'm gonna be your boy
Yes, be my girlfriend baby
Honey and I'm gonna be your boy
Yeah, I'm gonna buy you a Cadillac car
Just to drive me where ever you are...

// You Upset Me Baby //

Well she's thirty-six in the bust
Twenty-eight in the waist
Forty-four in the hips
She's got real crazy legs
You upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
And I'm telling you people
She's something fine that you really ought to see

Well she's not too tall
Complexion is fair
Man she knocks me out 
The way she wears her hair
You upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
Like being hit by a falling tree
Woman, woman what you do to me

Well I've tried to describe her
It's hard to start
I'd better stop now
Because I've got a weak heart
Well you upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
Well like being hit by a falling tree
Woman, woman what you do to me

Well I've tried to describe her
It's hard to start
I'd better stop now
Because I've got a weak heart
You upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
Well like being hit by a falling tree
Woman what you do to me

// Every Day I Have The Blues //

Everyday, everyday I have the blues 
Everyday, everyday I have the blues 
When you see me worried baby 
Because it's you I hate to lose 

Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care 
Yes nobody loves me, nobody seems to care 
Speaking of bad luck and trouble 
Well you know I had my share 

I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line 
Yes I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line 
Where there ain't nobody worried 
And there ain't nobody crying

// Bad Luck //

Well, my bad luck is falling
Falling down like rain
Bad luck is falling
Falling down like rain
No matter what I do
Seems like my luck won't never change

I felt kinda lucky
My luck was running slow
The last hand I caught four aces
And the police broke down the door
I said, Lord
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it bad when you can't make no money
Seems like all the bad breaks will come to you

Yeah, I got home this morning
She was looking kinda funny
She said "Don't come in, daddy
Daddy, unless you got some money"
And I said, Lord
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it tough when you can't make no money
Without your woman turning her back on you

Well now, I asked my woman for some dinner
She looked at me like a fool
She said, "I'm playing checkers, daddy
And I think it's your turn to move"
I said, oh
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Yes, it's bad when you can't make no money
And your woman turns her back on you

// 3 O'Clock Blues //

Well now it's three o'clock in the morning
And I can't even close my eyes
Three o'clock in the morning baby
And I can't even close my eyes
Can't find my baby
And I can't be satisfied

I've looked around me
And my baby she can't be found
I've looked all around me, people
And my baby she can't be found
You know if I don't find my baby
I'm going down to the Golden Ground
That's where the men hang out

Goodbye, everybody
I believe this is the end
Oh goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
I want you to tell my baby
Tell her please please forgive me
Forgive me for my sins

// Woke Up This Morning //

I woke up this morning, my baby was gone 
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone 
I've feel so bad, I'm all alone 

I ain't got nobody, stayn' home with me 
I ain't got nobody, stayn' home with me 
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery 

Well baby, I'm all alone 
Yes baby, I'm all alone 
I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone 
All right

Oh baby, I'm all alone 
Oh baby, I'm all alone 
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery 

Oh baby, come on stay with me
Oh baby, come on stay with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery 

Oh baby, I'm all alone 
Oh baby, I'm all alone 
I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone

// You Know I Love You //

Darlin', darlin' you know I love you 
I love you, for myself 
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else 

I think of you, think of you every morning 
I dream of you, every night
And I'd love to be with you always 

When night began to fall 
I cry, cry alone 
And I wish, I could hold you in my arms tonight 

Darlin', Darlin' you know I love you 
I love you, for myself 
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else

// Sweet Little Angel //

I've got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes, when she spreads her wings around me
I get joy, and everything

You know I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Oh yes, I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Whoah, you know I ask her to buy a little drink of liquor
And she gave me a whiskey still

Oh, if my baby should quit me
I believe I would die
Oh if my baby should quit me
Lord I do believe I would die
Yes if you don't love me little angel
Please tell me the reason why

// Did You Ever Love A Woman //

Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Well, and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right

You fix her breakfast in the morning
Stay at home everyday
Even wash the dishes
If she has to go away
You send the children to school
Even mend their hose
Stay up all nights with the babies
Even wash their dirty clothes

Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Yes, and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right

But when it's time to go to bed
The woman grabs you in her arms
She holds you real tight
She hugs you with all her charms
She calls you a lot of sweet names
Then she turns out the light
She sets your soul on fire
And you say, "Baby, everything is all right"

Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Yes, and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right

// Crying Won't Help You //

Oh no matter what you say baby
No matter what you do
The way you've been treating me woman
Is coming back home to you
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you baby
Oh, crying won't help you woman
'Cause you've been so mean to me

Oh, you must remember baby
No matter where you go
Watch those seeds just scatter woman
Because you're gonna reap just what you sow
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you baby
'Cause you been so mean to me

Oh, the way you've been treating me woman
Just can't understand
Oh, I'm gonna leave you woman
Let you do the best you can
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you woman
'Cause you been so mean to me
Look out!

Oh, just before I leave you woman
Just before I shake your hand
I'm gonna get me a woman baby
Not to get your mad
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you baby
'Cause you been so mean to me
