// Blue Shadows //

Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away
Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away
You know the blues is my companion, every night and every day

The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye
The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye
I wish I could change her mind, but I know it's no use for me to try

Yes will you talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone
Won't you please talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone
Let me tell you how I miss you baby and how it feels to be alone

So brother, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my advice
Say, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my advice
You better treat her like an angel and keep her home at any price

// We Can't Agree //

You never treated me gentle
Yet you spend up all of my gold
Then you look around for a young man
Tell me I'm too old
That's why we can't agree
Yeah, baby, we can't agree

Now if I don't see you no more, baby
It'll be way too soon for me
You're known for being a lover
You like to holler loud
One man for you ain't nothing
You talk so loud you draw a crowd
That's why we can't agree
Yes, baby, we can't agree
Now if I don't see you no more, baby
It'll be way too soon for me

You're used to eating hot dogs
When you go out to dine
I taught you what a steak was
And now you've almost lost your mind
That's why we can't agree
Yes, baby, we can't agree
Now if I don't see you no more, baby
Honey, that'll be way too soon for me
You know it will

Now your clothes look like a sifter
Because they had so many holes
You know we both
Came from the ghetto, baby
And everybody knows
We can't agree
Yes, baby, we can't agree
Now if I don't see you
No more, little woman
Honey, it'll be way too soon for me
Yes, it will

Another one of them crazy endings.
That's the only way I could get out of it.

// Ghetto Woman //

She's a ghetto woman, waitin for her man to come home
Oh poor ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
She's just a ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
To come home

A rat run cross the floor, a roach turn up the wall
Everything is noisy around her, that don't seem to bother her at all
Cause she's a ghetto woman, sittin there all alone
She's just a ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
To come home

Yes, the tv's on, radio blastin' the news
Somebody down the hall, playin the low down dirty blues
My ghetto woman, she's all alone
She's just a ghetto woman, waitin for her man to come home
To come home

Cause she's a ghetto woman, said she's a ghetto woman
Oh, ghetto woman, what's on your mind
Sometimes I look in your face, can't help but cry.

// Part-Time Love //

Try it one more, please.

You know I got to find me
People, I got to find me
A part time love
Oh I need
I need me a part time love
Every time
Every time my baby leaves me
You know I need a part time love

The people in the cemetery
They're not all alone
Some turn to dust
And some have bone
You know I'd rather be dead
Six feet in my grave
Than to live lonely
Each and everyday

I need me
I need me a part time love
Every time my woman leaves me
You know I need a part time love

She came home this morning
I asked her where she'd been
She said, "Don't ask me
No questions, baby
'Cause I'll be leaving again"

I've got to find me
Don't you see, I've got to find me
A part time love
My baby leaves me
I need a part time love
Yes, I do

Oh every time my woman leaves me
Have to suffer
The whole time she's gone
I got to say it again
When she leaves me
I suffer every time she's gone
When she leaves me
I just got to have me a part time love
Is there somebody out there

Oh I need
Mm, I need me a part time love
Can't say it too much
I need, oh, I need...

// Power Of The Blues //

Get it while it's hot.

I've been all over Europe
And across the sea
With each new place
It gets clearer to me
Week after week
On tour with my band
You don't have to speak
'Cause they all understand

The power of the blues
Hey, hey, the power of the blues
And that's good news
I'm talking about the power of the blues

Yes, it's just a few changes
That I won't deny
But if you think it's easy
You just give it a try
You know the truth
But you're afraid to say it
That it ain't what I play
It's the way that I play it

That's the power of the blues
Yes, the power of the blues
You'll change your views
When you hear the power of the blues

Now me and Lucille
We're gonna stop this war
I'm no politician
But I know the score
You can call me a hawk
Or maybe I'm a dove
But all we gotta do
Is shoot 'em full of love

With the power of the blues
Hey, the power of the blues
It's the thing to use
Talking about the power of the blues
Yes, I am

// Ain't Nobody Home //

Once upon a time, a long long time ago, wherever you'd lead me, I would surely follow 
Girl, you put me through some pain and misery 
And now you are standing on my doorstep, telling me how much you need me 
Baby, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

How many times I begged for you to come home, but you laughed at me and said let me alone 
Through my falling tears I saw you walk away 
And now you're beggin' me to forgive you, but this time, baby, it's your turn to beg 
Baby, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

Girl, I used to love you, placed no one else above you 
Gave you everything that I own 
Girl, you can't come back here 
Ain't nobody home

Once upon a time, when you went on your way 
But, girl, I hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day 
But time has made some changes, turned me upside down 
So, you can beg me to forgive you, but this time, baby, you can turn right around 

Ain't nobody home 
Ain't nobody home 
Girl, you hurt me once
I hear you knockin'
