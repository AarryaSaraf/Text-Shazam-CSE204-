// Going Home //

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm gonna take her in my arms
I'm gonna hold her all night long
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

So now, hurry up Mister Man
Load just as fast as you can
The plane is already late
I'm gonna get home as soon as I can
I wanted to take a bus
But they said the road was bad
I started to take a train but a freight was all they had

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm gonna take her in my arms

I'm gonna hold her all night long
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

If there is something wrong
Want to you please let me know
Because my baby needs me
And I really really must go
How bad I wanna see my woman
I guess you'll never know
I would start tryin' to walk
But walkin' is too slow

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm gonna take her in my arms
I'm gonna hold her all night long
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

// You Never Know //

Yeah, you never know how you hurt me, baby, how bad I feel inside
Oh, you never know how you hurt me, woman, how bad I feel inside
I believed you when you said you loved me, oh, but I know you lied

Oh, when I lay down in darkness, I keep hearin' your sweet voice
When I lay down in darkness, baby, I keep hearin' your sweet voice
And I remember your church, woman, oh, and how I rejoice

I know the people are talkin', baby, but I don't care what they say
I realize that people talkin', baby, but I don't care what they say
I know I still love you, woman, and I want you home to stay

Yeah, if you ever change your mind, woman, won't you please come on home
Oh, if you ever change your mind, baby, won't you please come on home
Yes, I'm not good without you, baby and you're not good to me gone

// Please Remember Me //

I'm cryin' please, baby, honey, please remember me
I'm cryin' please, baby, please remember me
Well, it fills my heart with great consolation, darlin', to know that you will remember me

Well, I want you to love me, baby, like the snow falls on the cold, cold ground
Yes, I want you to love me, baby, like the snow falls on the cold, cold ground
Lord, with your love like that, darlin', I know you'll never let me down

Well, alright
Just talk to me, baby
Yes, alright

Well, when you were leavin', baby, well, I could see the smile on your face
Oh, yes, when my baby was leavin', people, I could see the smile on her face
Well, you know I'm so glad, people, there is no-one can take my place

// Come Back, Baby //

Come back, baby, don't break up my home
Yeah, you know I'm gonna miss you darlin'
After you are gone
Come back, baby, can we talk it over one more time

Oh baby, you know this world wasn't made in one day
Woah, we can talk it over, darling
Before you go away
Come back baby, let's talk it over one more time

Well now, baby, don't break up my heart
Well, Lord it hurts me so bad, darling
For us to have to part
So come back, baby, yeah, we can talk it over one more time

Well, come back, baby, you know just what I love you
Well, if I can't be with you, darling
Send me to heaven above
So come back, baby
Can't we talk it over, one more time

// You Won't Listen //

Yeah, you won't listen to nothing I tell you, woman, you keep on doin' as you please
Yeah, you won't listen to a thing I tell you, baby, you keep on doin' as you please
But I've taken it as long as I can, baby, when is this foolishness gonna cease

I worried myself crazy, baby, cried both night and day
I worried myself crazy, woman, I cried both night and day
You didn't believe me, baby, when I told you I'm gonna leave one day

Yeah, you told me that you love me, woman, but action speaks louder than words
Well, you said that you love me, woman, but action speaks louder than words
I won't be foolin' around no more, that's a line everybody has heard

If you don't change for the better, baby, you better do it real soon
If you don't change for the better, woman and you better do it real soon
Or you will wake up one of these mornings, baby, and find yourself in a empty room

// Sundown //

Long about sundown, I've gotta be on my way 
Sad long about sundown, I've gotta be on my way 
Goin' back to my woman and this time I'm gonna stay  
Yes, I've been gone for a long time 
Wonder if I'm welcome home 
Wonder if I'm welcome home 
Been gone for a long time 
So many things can happen  
When a man leaves his baby all alone 
Yes, it took a long time, baby 
When I knock on the door 
To realise what a fool I've been 
Well, I said it took a long, long time, baby 
To realise what a fool I've been 
I wonder will she let me in

// You Shouldn't Have Left //

You shouldn't have left me, baby
Baby, you shouldn't have gone away
Oh, you shouldn't have left me, baby
Baby, you shouldn't have gone away
Oh, you left the one that love you, woman
Cryin' every night and every day

Someone that you love more, baby
Made you break my heart in two
Someone that you love more, baby
Made you break my heart in two
I want you to remember, baby
The same thing could happen to you

When the pain's in your heart, woman
Make you feel like you could die
Oh, when the pain's, the pain's in your heart, baby
Make you feel like you could die
Oh, you'll know then that you shouldn't have left me, woman
Baby, and how it feels to say goodbye

// Shake Yours //

Hello, baby, I'm so glad to be back 
Got news for you, baby, that's a nat'ral fact 
Since I am back, let's get into our act 

I love you, baby, more than words can say 
You know I've missed you while I was away 
Now, come back, baby, now it's time to play 

Now, flop, roll, while I sing 
Do you know love will do anything? 
You gotta shake your boogie, I'm gonna shake mine too 
You sweet little angel, you've got a lot of lovin' to do

// The Letter //

Yes, I want to write a letter
But I don't know just where to begin
Yes, I want to write a letter, people
But I don't know just where to begin
Well, I tell you, it's a sin, people
The way I've been treated by my so called friends

Yes, if I got a dollar
They want to borrow half a buck
Whoa, and if I want to gamble
They wanna jinx me and give me bad luck
So, I tell you it's a sin, people
The way I've been treated by my so called friends

Yes, they say friends
They're the greatest thing in the world
Yes, they say close, close friends
They're the greatest thing in the world
But I think that's all wrong people
Because my best friend have taken my girl

// The Road I Travel (Aka Hard Luck Blues) //

Well, the rocks is my pillow
The cold ground is my bed
The highway is my home so I might as well be dead

I'm walkin' and walkin', seems I have no place to go
Yes, mama's dead and gone
And papa throw me from his door

I have one pair of shoes
Don't even have a change of clothes
And this road I've got to travel, yes, it's so chilly and cold

Yes, I'm going to have religion and learn how to pray
I need help, now people, seem that's the only way

I'm travellin' and travelin'
Seem like this road has got no end
I ain't got nobody, people
In this whole world to call my friend

I've got so much trouble, people, sometimes I could cry
I've got so much trouble, so much trouble
Sometimes I could cry
Yes, sometimes I could just break down
Seem like I could just break down and die

// Dust My Broom //

I'm gonna get up in the mornin',
I believe I'll dust my broom
I believe I'll dust my broom
Girlfriend, the black man you been lovin',
girlfriend, can get my room

I'm gon' write a letter,
Telephone every town I know
Telephone every town I know
If I can't find her in West Helena,
She must be in East Monroe, I know

I don't want no woman,
Wants every downtown man she meet
Wants every downtown man she meet
She's a no good doney,
They shouldn't 'low her on the street

I believe, I believe I'll go back home
I believe, I believe I'll go back home
You can mistreat me here, babe,
But you can't when I go home

And I'm gettin' up in the morning,
I believe I'll dust my broom
I believe I'll dust my broom
Girlfriend, the black man that you been lovin',
Girlfriend, can get my room

I'm gon' call up Chiney,
She is my good girl over there
She is my good girl over there
If I can't find her on Philippine's Island,
She must be in Ethiopia somewhere

// A Woman Don't Care //

You may be rich
You may be poor
You may be high
Or you just may be low
But if you fall in love
Oh, and you should lose
A woman don't care
She don't care who she gives the blues

Wo, you may be young
You may be old
Maybe you've heard
Or maybe you've never been told
If you've got a good woman
Oh, try not to misuse
Oh, a woman don't care
She don't care who she gives the blues

She'll make you hot in the winter

Make you cold in the summertime

She'll make you feel young in the spring
And in the fall drive you out of your mind
A woman, don't you hear me callin' you?
Yeah woman, you don't care
Yeah, you don't care who you give the blues

Oh, you may be up
You may be down
You may be short, tall, skinny
Or you just might be round
Oh, don't be too sure of your woman
Thinkin' man, that you can't lose
Oh, remember that a woman don't care
She don't care who she gives the blues
