// Boogie Woogie Woman //

I got a boogie-woogie woman
Boogie-woogie all the time
I got a boogie-woogie woman
Boogie-woogie all the time
If she keep on boogyin'
She bound to lose her mind

Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies all night long
Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies all night long
Yes, and the...come
She's still goin' strong

Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies late at night
Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies late at night
Well, I don't mind her boogyin'
'Cause her boogyin' is all right

Well, she's a bogie-woogie woman
And she boogies all the time
Well, she's a bogie-woogie woman
And she boogies all the time
Well, if keep on boogyin'
She bound to lose her mind

// Don't You Want A Man Like Me //

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than your used-to-be

Oh baby, don't you need a man like me
Oh baby, don't you need a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than any man in town

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than your used-to-be

// What Can I Do? //

People say you love but one at time
For every woman there's a man
My baby say she wasn't put here forever
So she's gonna get as many as she can
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do

Well, some people may be wrong sometimes
But they can't be wrong all the time
Like they say a cat has nine lives
Nine loves has the woman of mine
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do

Well, the women are funny these days
They do wrong in so many ways
They'll have a man twiddling his fingers
Or either drinking his life away
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do

// Early In The Morning //

It's early in the morning and I can't get right
'Cause I had a little date with my baby last night

Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

I went to all the places where we used to go
I went to her house but she don't live there no more

And it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
I went to her girlfriend's house, but she was out
I knocked on her door and her mother started to shout
"Get away from here!"

Too early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Went to Jenny Lou's to get something to eat
The waitress looked at me, she said, "B., you sure look beat"
It's early in the morning, baby
Early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Had a lot of money when I first started out
I couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out

Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

It's early in the morning
I ain't got nothin' but the blues

// I Want To Get Married //

I want to get married
But no woman will hear my plea
I want to get married
But no woman will hear my plea
Yes, it seems somehow
I can't get one to walk downthe aisle with me

Well, I've only been in love
But three times in my life
Yes, the first, I couldn't satisfy her
But I've only been in love three times in my life
Yes, the second one was a juice-head
And the third was another man's wife

Yeah, they say "join the navy
If you really wanna see the world"
Well, but I say "join B.B. King
Baby if you really want to be loved"

Aw, my time is gone
Babe and I really must say goodbye
Aw, my time is gone
Babe and I really must say goodbye
So you women better watch out
I must have that wife before I die

// Past Day //

Well, this past day, darlin'
I don't have to cry no more
Well, this past day, darlin'
I don't have to cry no more
Well, I found my baby
Don't have to walk from door to door

Well, I look around me
Lord, my baby can't be found
Well, I look around me
Lord, my baby can't be found
Well, I don't have to walk around no more
Don't have to go down to the bowlin' ground

Oh, I'm sayin' goodbye
Well, I don't say goodbye no more
Oh, I'm sayin' goodbye
Well, I don't say goodbye no more
Well, I found my baby
Don't have to walk from door to door

// Troubles, Troubles, Troubles //

Troubles, trouble, troubles, troubles is all in the world I see 
Troubles, trouble, troubles, troubles is all in the world I see 
Oh sometimes I wonder, wonder what is gonna become of me 

When I wake up early in the mornin', blues and troubles all around my bed 
Oh when I wake up early in the mornin', blues and troubles all around my bed 
Oh I never will forget people, the last words I heard my baby said 

She said I'm leavin' you in the mornin', BB and cryin' won't make me stay 
She said I'm leavin' you in the mornin', BB and your cryin' won't make me stay 
Ah the more you cry honey, the farther you're goin' to drive me away 

Oh if you just got to go baby, I hope you will come back one day 
Oh yes if you just got to go baby, please come on back some day 
Oh but I never will forget baby, baby the way we used to love and play

// Ruby Lee //

Well now I've got a girl
Her name is Ruby Lee
I'm tellin' you boys
She's alright with me
She's my baby
Yes, she's my baby
Well, she's my baby
'Cause she seems to be true to me

Well, I woke up this mornin'
I didn't know what to do
I turned on the radio
And the tune remaind me of you
You're my baby
Yes, you're my baby
Well, you're my baby
For you seem to be true to me

Well, she never takes my money
She never leaves me alone
She's the type of woman that
I would love to have in my home
She's my baby
Yes, she's my baby
Well, she's my baby
'Cause she seems to be true to me

Well, you know my secret
I'm tellin' you the reason why
So don't bother my baby
And please don't try
She's my baby
Yes, she's my baby
Well, she's my baby
'Cause she seems to be true to me
