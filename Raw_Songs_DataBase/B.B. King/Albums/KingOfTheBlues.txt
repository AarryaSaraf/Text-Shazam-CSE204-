// (I've) Got A Right To Love My Baby //

I've got a right to love my baby
She treats me just like a king
I've got a right to love my woman
She treats me just like a king
Yes, she's my mind, body and soul
Yes, my baby, she can do 'most anything

Yes, she's my doctor when I'm sick, people
She's my all-around standby
Oh, she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble, people
She's my mother when I wanna cry
Yes, I've got a right to love my baby
Oh, can't you see the reason why?

Oh, that gives me the right to love my woman
She's always here by my side
Oh, my sweet understanding baby
She makes my temperature rise
Yes and when it comes to kind treating people
My baby's an angel in disguise

Oh, when I'm sick she is my doctor
When I'm well she's my pride and joy
Yes, when I'm cold she's my cover
Yes, she calls me her little baby boy
Yes, when I'm tired and wanna play, people
It's my baby that's my toy

// Good Man Gone Bad //

I want you to stop right there, baby
Baby, and try to understand
Hey, I might have been your fool for a while, baby
But I know I'm a good loving man
And you shouldn't lie to me, baby
Makes me mad as a man can be

I know when you got home last night
Your kissing me was your plan
I know you were just faking me, baby
'Cause you'd been out with your other man
And you shouldn't lie to me, baby
Makes me mad as a man can be

Hey, I can't quit you, baby
'Cause you're honey but the bees don't know
There's one thing I got to tell you, little girl
Just one thing before I go
That is you shouldn't lie to me, baby
Makes me mad as a man can be

// Partin' Time //

Baby, if you can't do no better
I think I'd better get me a woman that can
Well, if you can't do no better, woman
I think I'd better get me a babe that can
Yes, you're goin' around cheatin' and lyin'
You ain't doin' nothin' but losin' a good man

Well, life is too short to be worryin', woman
Babe and you're old enough to understand
Yes, life is too short to be worryin', woman
And you're old enough to understand
Baby, if you can't do no better, baby
I think I'd better get me a woman that can

Oh, if I never said hello to you, woman
Than I wouldn't be sayin' goodbye
Oh, I've got my bags already packed, woman
I'm so hurt I wanna cry
Yes, what makes, what makes you treat me like you do, baby?
Yes I wanna know, tell me why.

// What Way To Go //

I've got to find my baby, I don't know what way to go
Yes, I've got to find my baby, I don't know what way to go
Yes, She don't believe that I love her, I've to find her so I can tell her so

She said that she loved me, people, she didn't want nobody else
Yes, my baby said she loved me, people, she didn't want nobody else
Well, you know I love that woman, people, better than I do myself

Baby, if you can hear my voice, please don't run away from me
Baby, if you can hear my voice, please don't run away from me
'Cause I mean every word I say, baby, I just can't hold on another day

Yes, if you love ever strike you, baby, sit down and write me a line or two
Yes, if you ever, if you ever, if you ever think about me, baby, sit down and write me a line or two
Yes, I wanna see you so bad now, woman, babe I don't know what to do

// Long Nights //

Yes the nights are so long, baby, and the days are so blue
Seems like everything has gone wrong
Baby 'cause I'm without you
I guess this is that awful feeling
Baby that feeling they call the blues

All by myself baby, yes I began to weep
Yes, and when I dry my eyes, baby
You know I still can't sleep
Yes, I guess this is the feeling
Baby the feeling they call the blues

Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes I can feel and I can see you, woman
I can see you all over the place

Yes, then I start walkin', woman
Start walkin' all over the floor
Yes, my heart is telling me, woman
Tellin' me you won't be here no more
Oh, I guess this is the feeling
Baby the feeling, the feeling they call the blues

// Feel Like A Million //

I've got a real fine woman and she gives me everything
I've got a real fine woman and she gives me everything
It just makes me feel so good just to hear my baby call my name

My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I could sing
My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I wanna sing
Yes, I feel just like a millionaire
When I hear my baby call my name

Yes, there ain't nobody like my baby
That's the reason I love her so
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody like my woman
That's the reason I love her so
Yes, I would even die for her and I want the whole world to know

Yes, when I'm down she'll pick me up
And tell me "Daddy you can't lose"
Yes, when I'm down, when I'm down, when I'm down, people
My baby tell me I can't lose
Yes, when all of my friends forget about me
My baby keeps away these blues

// I'll Survive //

You say you're leaving, you've shattered my dreams 
All of our plans dear, forgotten it seems 
Yes, it had to happen 
I'm not surprised, but I'll, I'll survive 

Your friends have shown you a much better way 
All of my loving you baby, all of those years, ended today 
Yes, you go on darlin' 
I'll dry my eyes, but I'll, I'll survive 

Go on! May God bless you 
It was fun. While it was fun 
Baby, I hate to lose you 
I say I hate to lose you baby 
It's all over! What's done is done 

Hey! you go on darlin', seek your fortune and fame 
All your good luck or bad luck 
Your friends must take the blame 
Oh! I can't beg you no more baby 
I've got too much pride, but I'll, I'll survive 

Oh, go on! May God bless you 
Oh, it was fun. While it was fun 
Oh baby, I hate to lose you 
I say I hate to lose you baby 
It's all over! What's done is done 

Hey! You go on baby, seek your fortune and fame 
All your good good luck or bad luck 
Friends must take the blame 
Oh! I can't beg you no more 
I've got too much pride, but I'll, I'll survive 

Oh! I'll, I'll survive 
Baby, I'll survive

// If I Lost You //

You're the greatest thing in my life, baby
Without your love, baby
I don't know just what I would do
Years of loving you, you've been so true
I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you

I guess I've been lucky to have someone so dear
To talk and laugh and always bring me cheer
After all of these years you've been so true to me, baby
I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you

After all of the lies I've told you
Just like giving you the stars
And buying you mink coats
Mink coats and diamonds, baby
Money in the bank and each year
Each year two brand new cars

You're the greatest thing in my life, baby
Between me and you I know I've got the best deal
Let me thank you, baby, you've been so true
I'd lose my mind if I lost you

// I'm King //

I've been around the world, seen everything
And if it's love you want baby just give me a ring
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues

I've loved in sunshine, I've loved in the rain
All of the women who know me call that loving man
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues

Some people go to school to try and learn their trade
Yes, but I'm a lover, a lover by nature
That's why I know, I know, I know I've got it made

Yes, you might think I'm jokin' or just havin' fun
But they tell me the reason I'm the king
I'm a lovin' son of a gun
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues
