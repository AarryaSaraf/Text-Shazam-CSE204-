// Walking After Midnight //

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight, just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

I stop to see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight, just hoping you may be 
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me

I stop to see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight, just hoping you may be 
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me

// I Fall To Pieces //

I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend?

You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget (to forget)
Pretend we've never met (never met)
And I've tried and I've tried, but I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces

I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name (speaks your name)
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame

You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me too (love me too)
The way you used to do (used to do)
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces
You walk by and I fall to pieces

// Foolin' 'Round //

I know that you've been foolin' 'round
On me right from the start
So I'll give back your ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Just come on home and fool around with me

Well I wasn't foolin' 'round the day I said "I do"
But many a night, I wished that I had been a-foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery
But when it's you, a fool I'll always be

I know that you've been foolin' 'round
On me right from the start
So I'll give back your ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' round with two or three
Then come on home and fool around with me

So honey, fool around, you know right where I'm at
And don't worry if I'm lonesome, 'cause I'm used to that
And when you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Then come on home and fool around with me

I know that you've been foolin' 'round
On me right from the start
So I'll give back your ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Just come on home and fool around with me

Umm, come on home, baby
Come on home, uh huh...

// The Wayward Wind //

[Chorus:]
Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

In a lonely shack by a railroad track
He spent his younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made him a slave to his wand'rin' ways

[Chorus:]
Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

Oh, I met him there in a border town
He vowed we'd never part
Tho' he tried his best to settle down
Now I'm alone with a broken heart

[Chorus:]
Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

The next of kin to the wayward wind...

// South Of The Border (Down Mexico Way) //

(Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay)

South of the Border, Down Mexico way
That's where they fell in love 
When stars above came out to play
And now as they wander, their thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way.

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while
He kissed the smile
Upon her face
For it was "Fiesta" and they were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way.

Then she sighed as she whispered "Manana"
Never dreaming that they were parting
And he lied as he whispered "Manana"
For that tomorrow never came.

South of the border, he rode back one day
There in a veil of white
By candlelight
She knelt to pray
The mission bells told him that he mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico way.

Ay-ay-ay-ay, (Ay-ay-ay-ay,) ay-ay-ay-ay (Ay-ay-ay-ay)
Ay-ay-ay-ay, (Ay-ay-ay-ay,) ay-ay-ay-ay (Ay-ay-ay-ay)....

// Seven Lonely Days //

Seven lonely days make one lonely week
Seven lonely nights make one lonely me
Ever since the time you told me we were thru
Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you

Oh, my darlin' I'm cryin', boo-hoo-hoo-hoo
There's no use in denyin' I cried for you
It was your favorite pastime, makin' me blue
Last week was the last time I cried for you

Seven hankies blue I filled with my tears
Seven letters true I filled with my fears
Guess it never pays to make your lover blue
Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you

Oh, my darlin I'm cryin', boo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Now, there's no use in denyin' I cried for you
It's all your favorite pastime, makin' me blue
Last week was the last time I cried for you
Last week was the last time I cried for you...

// San Antonio Rose //

Deep within my heart
Lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone,
Where in dreams I live
With a memory,
Beneath the stars all alone.

Well, it was there I found
Beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the
Blue up above,
For that moonlit pass
That only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love.

Moon in all your splendor,
Known only to my heart,
Call back my rose,
Rose of San Antone!
Lips so sweet and tender,
Like petals fallin apart,
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song,
Empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone,
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo,
And rose my rose of San Antone!

[Instrumental]

Well the, Moon in all your splendor,
Known only to my heart,
Call back my rose,
Rose of San Antone!
Lips so sweet and tender,
Like petals fallin apart,
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song,
Empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone,
Well that moonlit pass by the Alamo,
And rose my rose of San Antone.
heh...

// True Love //

While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on it will always be
True love, true love

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true

But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true
Love forever true

// A Poor Man's Roses (Or A Rich Man's Gold) //

I must make up my mind today
What to have, what to hold
A poor man's roses
Or a rich man's gold

One's as wealthy as a king in a palace
Tho' he's callous and cold
He may learn to give his heart for love
Instead of buyin' it with gold

Then the poor man's roses
And the thrill when we kiss
Will be memories of paradise
That I'll never miss

And yet the hand that brings the rose tonight
Is the hand I will hold
For the rose of love means more to me
More than any rich man's gold

[Instrumental]

Then the poor man's roses
And the thrill when we kiss
Will be memories of paradise
That I'll never miss

And yet the hand that brings the rose tonight
Is the hand I will hold
For the rose of love means more to me
More than any rich man's gold...

// Have You Ever Been Lonely (Have You Ever Been Blue) //

Have you ever been lonely
Have you ever been blue
Have you ever loved someone
Just as I love you

Can't you see that I'm sorry
For each mistake I've made
Can't you see I've changed, dear
Can't you see that I've paid

Oh, be a little forgivin'
Take me back in your heart
How can I go on livin'
Now that we're apart

If you knew what I've been through
You would know why I ask you
Have you ever been lonely
Have you ever been blue (have you ever been blue)

Be a little forgivin'
Take me back in your heart
How can I go on livin'
Now that we're apart (we're apart)

If you knew what I been through
You would know why I ask you
Have you ever been lonely
Have you ever been blue (have you ever been blue)
