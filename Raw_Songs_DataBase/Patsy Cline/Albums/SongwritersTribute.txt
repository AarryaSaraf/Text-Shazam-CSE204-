// I Love You So Much It Hurts //

I love you so much, it hurts me
Darlin, that's why I'm so blue
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night
Afraid of losing you

I love you so much, it hurts me
And there's nothing I can do
I want to hold you my dear, forever and ever
I love you so much, it hurts me so

I love you so much, it hurts me
And there's nothing I can do
I want to hold you my dear, forever and ever
I love you so much, it hurts me so...

// Crazy //

Crazy
I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so blue

I knew
You'd love me as long as you wanted
And then some day
You'd leave me for somebody new

Worry
Why do I let myself worry?
Wondering
What in the world did I do?

Oh, crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying
And crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

Crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying
And crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

// When You Need A Laugh //

You can't imagine how it hurts me
To have you treat me like you do
Knowing that my love is just a joke to you
But I'll take it just to see you
And laugh as teardrops fall
So when you need a laugh, give me a call

Everybody says I'm crazy
To let you treat me this way
But I can't explain, so, what else can I say
At least I'm on your mind when you're laughin'
Somehow that breaks the fall
So when you need a laugh, give me a call

I'd gladly trade the laugh you get
For making fun of me
To be around the one I love and need so desperately
So even if the laugh's on me
I don't mind at all
So when you need a laugh, give me a call
So when you need a laugh, give me a call

// You Took Him Off My Hands //

You took him off my hands
When you stepped in
You changed everything
We're not even friends.

Don't leave the job half done
Leave nothing behind
You took him off my hands
Now please take him off my mind.

Please take his photograph
Engraved on my heart, so blue
And take all his memories
He now belongs to you.

Don't leave the job half done
Leave nothing behind
You took him off my hands
Now, please take him off my mind.

Please take his photograph
Engraved on my heart, so blue
And take all his memories
He now belongs to you.

Don't leave the job half done
Leave nothing behind
You took him off my hands
Now. please take him off my mind.

You took him off my hands
Now, please take him off my mind...

// Your Kinda Love //

You say you love me
Then you treat me like a stranger
I don't understand your kind of love
You say you need me
And that makes it even stranger
No, I don't understand your kind of love.

If you can't be all mine
Then why am I all yours
I wonder where a heart draws the line
I try not to see you
But you're a great arranger
No, I don't understand your kind of love.

If you can't be all mine
Then why am I all yours
I wonder where a heart draws the line
I try not to see you
But you're a great arranger
No, I don't understand your kind of love.

No, I don't understand your kind of love...

// Lovin' In Vain //

I still want your lovin'
And I still need your lovin'
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain
Last night I saw you a-walkin
Talkin' with another
Overheard you tell her
Our love don't mean a thing
And as I walked away dear
My heart broke down inside me
I still want your lovin'
And I still need your lovin'
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain

I'd rather be a poor girl
Not a penny to my name
Than to know my life
Would all be lived in vain
I'd rather be alone dear
If you don't want to change
I still want your lovin'
And I still need your lovin'
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain
I still want your lovin'
And I still need your lovin'
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain

// You're Stronger Than Me //

If you are sincere
When you say you don't care
That our love is just a memory.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

For if still lovin' you means I'm weak
Then I'm weak
For I still, fall apart when we speak
Or we meet.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

If you can have fun
With some other one
With no thought of what used to be.
If it's easy to say
That it's better this way
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

For if still lovin' you means I'm weak
Then I'm weak
For I still fall apart when we speak
Or we meet.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me...

// Imagine That //

Imagine me still lovin' you
After all you've put me through
Well I can't help it, I just do
Imagine that
And that's not the half

Imagine this if you can
I've stood more, more than I should stand
But I'd still take you, back again
Imagine that
Ain't that a laugh

Can you believe, I'd swallow my pride
Well yes, yes, I guess you can
'Cause you know you've always had my foolish heart
Right in the palm of your hand, oh

So for what it's worth it to you
It just don't matter what you might do
'Cause I'm still waitin' and lovin' you
Imagine that
Ain't that a laugh

So for what it's worth, to you
It just don't matter what you might do
'Cause I'll still be waitin' and lovin' you
Imagine that
Ha A... Ain't that a laugh...

// So Wrong //

I've been so wrong
For so long
Thought I could live 
Without the love that you give
I was wrong oh, so wrong

I've been so wrong
For so long
I didn't know that I loved you so
I was wrong

Well I never knew 
I could want you 
Darling, oh, so much
Now that you're gone 
I dream of you 
And your sweet touch

I was so wrong
For so long
But I've seen the light 
Darling, I'll make it right
I was wrong

Well, I never knew 
I could want you 
Darling, oh, so much
Now that you're gone, 
I dream of you 
And your sweet touch

I, was so wrong
For so long
But I've seen the light 
Darling, I'll make it right
I was wrong...

// That's How A Heartache Begins //

Tell a little white lie
And then multiply by ten
And then, that's how a heartache begins

Mix some flowers he bought
With a date he forgot to attend
And then, that's how a heartache begins

I know about heartaches
I know all the mistakes
That a young love can make, I've made them
So let's still be friends
To the soft violins
I've listened while somebody played them

Called his number in vain
Again and again, he's not in
But then, that's how a heartache begins

I know about heartaches
I know all the mistakes
That a young love can make, I've made them
So let's still be friends
To the soft violins
I've listened while somebody played them

Called his number in vain
Again and again, he's not in
But then, that's how a heartache begins

That's how a heartache begins

That's how a heartache begins...

// He Called Me Baby //

He called me baby, baby, all night long
Used to hold and kiss me until dawn
Then one day I woke and he was gone
Now there's no more baby, baby, all night long

He called me baby, baby, all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
Oh, what I'd give if he'd just come on back home
And call me baby, baby, all night long

He called me baby, baby, all night long
Built me up so high and made me strong
Now each night, in dreams, just like a song
I still hear baby, baby
Still hear baby, baby
Still hear baby, baby, all night long
