There he goes, he's walking away
Each step he takes brings heartaches my way
She won his heart, I lost him some way
There he goes, he's walking away

If I hadn't cheated and I hadn't lied
I'd be the one walking by his side
I love him still and I guess that it shows
He's walking away, there he goes

If I hadn't cheated and I hadn't lied
I'd be the one walking by his side
I love him still and I guess that it shows
He's walking away, there he goes
