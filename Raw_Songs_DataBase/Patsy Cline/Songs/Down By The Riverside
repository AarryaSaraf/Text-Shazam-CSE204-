Well I met my little brown-eyed gal
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I met my little brown-eyed gal
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I asked her for a little kiss
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I asked her for a little kiss
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
I said have patience little man
But I'm sure you'll understand
I hardly know your name
You said if I can have my way
Maybe some sweet day
Your name and my will be the same
Well I wed that little brown-eyed gal
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I wed that little brown-eyed gal
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
