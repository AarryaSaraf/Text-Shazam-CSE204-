Won't you come home, Bill Bailey? Won't you come home?
I moan the whole night long
I'll do the cooking, honey, I'll pay the rent
I know that I've done you wrong

Remember that rainy eve that I drove you out
With nothing but a fine tooth comb
Yes, I know that I'm to blame and ain't that a shame
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey? Won't you come home?
I moan the whole night long
I'm gonna do your cooking, honey, I'm gonna pay your rent
I know that I've done you wrong
(Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?)

Remember that rainy eve that I drove you out
With nothing but a fine tooth comb
Well, I know that I'm to blame and ain't that a dirty low down shame
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
Come home, Bill Bailey
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
Come home, Bill Bailey
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
Come home
