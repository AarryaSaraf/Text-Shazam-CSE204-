Tonight alone I 'm thinking 
Of the things we use to do
There's laughter all around me 
But my heart still aches for you

The wedding bells are ringing
But to me their chimes are blue
How can I face tomorrow 
When I know I'm losing you

The dreams we shared 
Have all been torn apart
It's your wedding day 
But I can't claim your heart

Now someone else will hold you 
Just the way I use to do
How can I face tomorrow 
When I know I'm losing you

The dreams we shared 
Have all been torn apart
It's your wedding day 
But I can't claim your heart

Now someone else will hold you 
Just the way I use to do
How can I face tomorrow 
When I know I'm losing you...
