You took him off my hands
When you stepped in
You changed everything
We're not even friends.

Don't leave the job half done
Leave nothing behind
You took him off my hands
Now please take him off my mind.

Please take his photograph
Engraved on my heart, so blue
And take all his memories
He now belongs to you.

Don't leave the job half done
Leave nothing behind
You took him off my hands
Now, please take him off my mind.

Please take his photograph
Engraved on my heart, so blue
And take all his memories
He now belongs to you.

Don't leave the job half done
Leave nothing behind
You took him off my hands
Now. please take him off my mind.

You took him off my hands
Now, please take him off my mind...
