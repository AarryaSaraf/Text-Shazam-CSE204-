// Fishing For Fishies //

Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

Don't matter to kiss
And put that poor fishie should be free

I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
All heights honk
Ego tying knots being fate
Don't do it
You ain't a God
Don't hunt salmon, cod or carp

Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

It seems like cruelty to me
And I'm hungry, leave them be

I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
All heights honk
Egos tying knots being fate
Don't do it
You ain't a God
Don't hunt salmon, cod or carp

Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies
Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

I have been fishing
And I don't want to catch none
I have been fishing
And I don't want to catch none
I've left them swum
I've left them swum
I've left them swum
I've left them swum

I have been fishing
And I don't want to catch none
I have been fishing
And I don't want to catch none

// Boogieman Sam //

Well, up jumped the Boogieman
He ate mothers' babies
He shot the policeman
And went down to the nightclub
And shocked all the patrons
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman
With a rope in his hand

Causing mayhem
'Cause he's the Boogieman
Causing mayhem
'Cause he's Boogieman Sam
(Boogieman Sam)

Well, up jumped the Boogieman
He stole from a punter
His ashes, he wanted it
To blow holes in the floorboards
And danced like a demon and
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman
With a rope in his hand

Causing mayhem
'Cause he's the Boogieman
Bottoms up, flailing
'Cause he's the Boogieman
(Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogieman)
Doing damage
'Cause he's the Boogieman
(Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie)
He's a blemish
'Cause he's Boogieman Sam
(Boogieman Sam)

Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie

// The Bird Song //

To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Is that even relevant?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a cow, what is a car?
It's a deadly predator
To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Can it think at all?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a cloud, what is a breeze?
It's a predetermined sneeze
To a seal what is real?
Surely more than it can feel
To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Is that even relevant?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?

// Plastic Boogie //

Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong

Fuck all of that plastic (Fuck all of that plastic)
Wrapped up in my dinner (Wrapped up in my diner)
It's not fantastic (It's not fantastic)
It's gonna come and kill us (It's gonna come and kill us)
It's gonna be massive (It's gonna be massive)
It's gonna be brutal (It's gonna be brutal)
Death will come from plastic (Death will come from plastic)
Death will come from people (Death will come from people)

Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong

Fuck all of those plastic
Particles in the ocean
It's like a vendetta
Against our Mother Nature

The way we wrap it
The way we wrap it is wrong
We wrap it
Plastic boogie
We wrap it
The way we wrap it
The way we wrap it
Plastic boogie
Plastic boogie
The way we wrap it
The way we wrap it is wrong
We wrap it
Plastic boogie
We wrap it
The way we wrap it
The way we wrap it
Plastic boogie
Plastic boogie
Plastic boogie
Plastic boogie

Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong

Fuck all of that plastic
Fuck all of that plastic
Fuck all of that plastic
Fuck all of that plastic

// The Cruel Millennial //

Underestimated technology
I'm addicted to tablet screens
No escaping battleground PUBG
Computer games ain't for me

Can't relate face to face with modern day youth
Outdated, the post millennial will get you
I was born in the echo boom
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial
I was only born in '92
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial
The cruel millennial

White dog shit; not on my nature strip
Calcium bone conspiracist
Berenstein bears read to as kids
It's a glitch in the matrix

Can't relate face to face with modern day youth
Outdated, the post millennial will get you
I was born in the echo boom
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial

The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial

// Real's Not Real //

What in the world is going on?
That pretty picture's looking wrong
If happy is all you wanna be
Then I can see that the painting ain't painted with love
What in the world is going on here?
Your past is built upon your fear
And happy is what you'll never be
I'm afraid that you're lacking some free will
Your real's not real
Your real's not real
What in the world is going on?
Can't we all just get along?
Our candy is melting in the sun
Can anyone be a martyr from hereafter?
What in the world is going on now?
Your farm is full of sacred cow
And happy is what you'll never be
I'm afraid that you're lacking some free will
Your real's not real
Your real's not real

// This Thing //

Well I fake a lot of symptoms to be a different person
I try to listen
I try to be primed for a reason to go back to sleep
That's not to say there's no relief
I like it when it happens; you don't
You're happy? When you show it; I won't
The cycle keeps repeating
I can't escape the rip
There's no stopping what this is
Back in the day your style was impressive, infectious, stress-less
Disposition had it all, nothing but rapport
Full of what you're empty of
I hide my riches in embarrassing sheets that reek of suspicious happenings
'Cause I'm a different person and that will make you sick
There's no stopping what this is
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
You're a load bearing friend and that is what makes this hard
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
And all that I know is one of us has to wring it out
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
I've thought about nothing but this
I won't escape the rip

// Acarine //

I am the honeybee
Drink the blood of the tree
I can't breathe, I can't see
Evil wind comforts me

Buried deep inside of me
Acarine
Buried deep inside of me
Acarine

Little mite, so much strife
Multiplied through a knife
I can't fly, I can't cry
Acarine, make me die

Buried deep inside of me
Buried deep inside of me
Buried deep inside of me
Acarine
Acarine
Acarine

Glory darkness, come see
The leaf, nothing
Saw smoke, life

Acarine
Acarine
Acarine
Acarine

// Cyboogie //

Cyboogie, boogie, boogie
Cyboogie
Cyboogie

Cyboogie, a hunk of rebar
Multitude cells in his brittle dome
Black fluid floating within
Flows between nodes in his cursed soul
Cyboogie, augmented senses
Scholarship broke off a celebration
Mind wasn't a consciousness can
Bouncy ball thoughts in his silicon chip

Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Cyboogie
Cyboogie

Cyboogie's heart is a mess
Cables in knots in his cavity chest
Cyboogie's feeling depressed
Need to debug and run over the tests
Cyboogie's tinkering flesh
Pistons and pumps at the creepy front desk
No people deserve the mess
When he breaks down it's broken to bits

Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Cyboogie
Cyboogie

Boogie boogie
Boogie boogie
Boogie boogie
Boogie boogie
Boogie boogie
Boogie boogie
Boogie boogie
Boogie boogie
Cyboogie

Cyboogie, lump in his throat
Palpitations and the heat I exhume
Cyboogie born to be
Terminal error in human tissue
Cyboogie's fishing for fishies
Pickling trout in a binary brook
How is it that he is depressed
The humans have pierced through his cheek with a hook

Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie

Cyboogie
Cyboogie
Cyboogie (Cyboogie, cyboogie)
Cyboogie (Cyboogie, cyboogie)
Cyboogie (Cyboogie, cyboogie)
Cyboogie (Dance with the devil)
Cyboogie (Go forth)
Cyboogie (Boogie, boogie, boogie!)
Cyboogie (Now the stars watch their silhouettes)
Cyboogie (They left Africa dancing)
Cyboogie (Their apex was dance)
Cyboogie (They existed for two hundred thousand years)
(...Thousand years)
Cyboogie
Cyboogie
