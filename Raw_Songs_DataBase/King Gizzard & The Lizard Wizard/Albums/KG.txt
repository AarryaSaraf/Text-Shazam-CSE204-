// Automation //

Join the last migration
It's fun, fuck the system
Your new mess made is great
King of a bald primate
We are not worthy
Of our heir's glory
Mental rotation for the overlord
(Woo!)

Superorganism
Caused a schism bending light through prisms
Cyber surgeon
JavaScript person
Digital cleanse
Tell all your friends the neural network's at work
(Woo!)

Automation
Automation
Automation
Automation
Automation
Automation
Automation

Prepare for mutation
Cause after all I'm sure
I heard the crack of doom
Death kiss
Everyone should be talkin' 'bout this
Human comet dinosaur inside a simulation
Automation
(Woo!)

// Minimum Brain Size //

Riddle me this, did you ever grow?
Break the spider's legs just to feed the crow
Sympathetic crowds are not well endowed
They dance flies on shit, swarming in the cloud

This is to all of the people who had it coming
A few biccys too many, I'm so lonely
It's to all of the people who said they couldn't hack it
I'll open their eyes
To minimum brain size

Re-enter the uterus and refund all your cells
Do it back-to-front like nobody else
Stay there for a while, "When you're back inside
You will not be missed," said the tear to the eye

It's pathetic though, you're weaker than you know
Parasitic mob, faceless undertow
Himpathetic bro, you're weaker than you know
You don't have a say a-a-anymore

This is to all of the people who had it coming
A few biccys too many, I'm so lonely
It's to all of the people who said they couldn't hack it
Radicalise
To minimum brain size

It's pathetic though, you're weaker than you know
Parasitic mob, no worse off alone
Himpathetic bro, you're weaker than you know
You don't have a say a-a-anymore

At the centre of it all, you ain't got the gall
You're pissing on a flame, standing on a ball
It's pathetic though, you're weaker than you know
You don't have a say a-a-anymore

A-a-anymore

// Straws In The Wind //

Galvanising uncertainty
Mindful of the weary inkling that is lurking
Hierarchy it's been cracking aegis
Embodied in this black heart shameless

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim
I can see the beelzebub Cheshire grin

Cooking something raw, cooking something big
Pandemonium, selfish pigs
Headless chickens scared shitless
The media, will never quit

Allegro fuelled with discontent
Mortal traffic lights signalling when to stay or go
Condescending expendables botched to a clock
Novice to the dilemma with nothing clever left in stock

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim
I can hear Hell's kitchen and they're singing hymns

Cooking something raw, cooking something big
Pandemonium, selfish pigs
Headless chickens scared shitless
The media, will never quit

The affluent with a bad omen hanging
Monstrosity scarce breaking freedom
Shrewd and not in the mood to disillude
We are the pillars of a forgotten pier

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?

Is it all, is it all straws in the wind?
Is it all, is it all straws in the wind?
Is it all, is it all straws in the wind?
Is it all, is it all straws in the wind?

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim
I can see the beelzebub Cheshire grin
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?

// Some Of Us //

Ancient tombs like sand filled wombs of peoples life past
Understand everything
Melted iron
Untold aeons
Crafted demise
Destroying everything

Black sand timelines
Shifting skylines
Faded guide signs revealing everything
Ancient Thracians from lost nations
Long gone people understand everything

Some, some of us see
Some, some of us don't
Assured everything turns into dust

Rigor mortis fossil tortoise remains dormant underneath everything
Ageless microbes reveal xenophobes
Endless plague thus infecting everything

Sapien rituals born of mind tools
Sects of false gods fade into everything
Eternal tribes of purgatory scribes
Ancient words thus foretelling everything

Some, some of us live
Some, some of us die
Assured everything turns into dust

Some, some of us live
Some, some of us die
Assured everything turns into dust

// Ontology //

Now there is something that's on my mind. Now there is something I cannot hide. Why is there is there anyone? Why do we think? What is the point of it? Why anything? Why is there anything? What is the link? What is the point of it? Why anything?

Don't question. Thinking for yourself is an overrated thing. Be free.

What can be said to exist inside a simulation inside my mind? What is the meaning? What is a thing? What is the point of it? Why anything? How many levels of ontology? What is the point of it? Why anything?

Don't question. Thinking for yourself is an overrated thing. Be free.

// Intrasport //

Don't take it personally, this is not about you
I begin to slide inward and throughout to
Shatter the static silencing my mind
Find the rhythm and set course to collide

Don't take it personally
My hands is disappearing
Dissolving in a tear
I am not needed here

Starting to feel something, I think I'm taking off
I think I'm feeling something, will I evaporate?
Is this me feeling something? I've got a bird's eye view
I have shed my skin, look at me now

Intra, intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra, intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky

I used to dream about killing certain people
Dreams that sew me up like sleeping with a needle
Those feelings that I had were building up to something
I feel a schism in the rhythm now I'm running

My hair is liquifying
My tastebuds are igniting
It's true I am evolving
It's all relative

Starting to feel something, I think I'm taking off
I think I'm feeling something, will I evaporate?
Is this me feeling something? I've got a bird's eye view
I have shed my skin, look at me now

Intra, intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra, intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky

Intra, intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra, intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky

Intra, intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra, intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky

// Oddlife //

All this rock n roll is bad for my ears. Lemme tell you one thing about my life. It's weird. All this head banging is bad for my brain. Lemme tell you one thing about my life. It's strange.

Sugarplum fairy dances now. Echoed feet on the hallowed ground. Energy peaks on the voyagers crown. Back to the bus for another round. Managing feats by managing feet. Head of the hydra tastes the breeze. Conduit sees from the living room suite. Boredom is what boredom breeds you see.

So deranged. Life is strange. It's human odd life.

All this indecision in anthropoids. Lemme tell you one thing about our life. It's odd. All this wire walking upon the knife. Lemme tell you one thing about human odd life.

Sugarplum fairy dances now. Echoed feet on the hallowed ground. Energy peaks on the voyagers crown. Back to the bus for another round. Managing feats by managing feet. Head of the hydra tastes the breeze. Conduit sees from the living room suite. Boredom is what boredom breeds you see.

Bitumen crossroad knife. It's human odd life.

No concept of geography. I wake up and I'm still fatigued. I'm drinking 'til I'm dead asleep. Riding high 'til I'm back home in one piece. Another carpark in the middle of nowhere. Another promoter hanging in your hair. Another backstage green room to prepare. Its an odd life gotta be aware.

It's an odd life til you get it right. It's an odd life til you get in the stride. It's an odd life til you get it right. It's an odd life til you get in the stride...

Odd life. Odd life. Odd life...

// Honey //

You taste like honey, all warm and runny
Kinder than a candy, effervescent shandy
Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya
The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion

Like the wind on a sail I'll steer you along
And the germs outside I'll keep you from
Like the hail in the morn' I'll sing you a song
While the mead I make can brew for you

You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey

Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it
Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it
We're endless motion, drink to that notion
Buoyant is your spirit, gotta keep me near it

Like the wind on a sail I'll steer you along
And the germs outside I'll keep you from
Like the hail in the morn' I'll sing you a song
While the mead I make can brew for you

You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey

You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey

Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it
Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it
Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya
The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion

// The Hungry Wolf Of Fate //

Would you throw our construction to the hungry wolf of fate?

Do it again 'cause we're mindless pissants
Do it again 'cause we haven't learned sense
Do it again so we auto-cremate
Don't do it again because it isn't safe

Death looms like a leering figure
Bring our species into sight

Do it again 'cause we're mindless pissants
Do it again 'cause we haven't learned sense
Do it again so we auto-cremate
Don't do it again because it isn't safe

Would you throw your deduction to the hungry wolf of fate?
Fill his plate with your namesake
Fatten him with your ego

Do it again 'cause were mindless pissants
Do it again 'cause we haven't learned sense
Do it again so we auto-cremate
Don't do it again because it isn't safe
