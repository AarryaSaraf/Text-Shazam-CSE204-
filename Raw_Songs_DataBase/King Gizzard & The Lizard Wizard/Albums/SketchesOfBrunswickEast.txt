Countdown
D-Day
I don't want to be late
For countdown
Distress
I don't want to make a mess

When it all falls away
Clothes start to fray
Buildings decay
Rabble remains
Where they were green
Sterility
Humanity
Staring at me

Where they were green
Sterility

Staring at me

// Tezeta //

Tezeta, tezeta
Tezeta, tezeta
Remember, remember
Tezeta, tezeta

If I've been insane
My whole life well now I've changed
Into something that sees
I love the feeling
Shape shifting ceiling
My mental projection is pink

Come here, girl
Who are you?
I am true perspective

Tezeta, tezeta
Tezeta, tezeta
Nostalgia, nostalgia
Tezeta, tezeta

Everything that lives and dies
Is a hologram
Nothing is as real as that

Come here, boy
Are you God?
I am that which I am

Do you remember now?
What? (Yes, I do!)
This, my altered plan!

// The Spider And Me //

Let me just introduce you to my friend
Under the tree
Spider and me
All day we'll sit about, giggling free
Under the tree
Spider and me

Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me

Laze in the afternoon sun
Gazing at each other's beauty
The huntsman's heart forever beats
Our union is forever

Love from a spider is nothing stranger
Than my admiring
Love of nature
Am I a hippie if I have this love?
We are the same stuff
From the same cloth

Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me (Spider and me)

Laze in the afternoon sun
Gazing at each other's beauty
The huntsman's heart forever beats
Our union is forever

Let me just introduce you to my friend
Under the tree
Spider and me

// Dusk To Dawn On Lygon Street //

Bedtime for the birds as night cloaks the earth
Then the moon smiles at the sun's birth
Faceless night cowers underneath
The ever-changing moonlit sky
Can you believe the way night falls away
As the sun starts a new day?

Plants raise their leaves as the sun waves goodbye
Dusk greets the horizon as day fades
Black lines bend round a cityscape
While trailing off in the sunset's wake
I can foresee that dawn will bring the light
As the sun gives way to night

// The Book //

God gave me a sign
He put it in my glass of wine
A great theophany
He told me every sinner had to die
[?]
And telepaths [?]
We are the sacrifice
Like it or not
I live by the book

These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless
The book
The book
The book

God gave me a knife
And wrote seppuku underlined
Godly suicide
He told me everyone will die
So judge me by the page
But [?] not by my cover
[?] with age
Like it or not
I live by the book

These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless
The book
The book
The book

These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless
The book
The book
The book

// You Can Be Your Silhouette //

When you make time
To clear the cobwebs off your mind
You may find yourself unwind
When all the ticking stops dead
You may find your time instead
And you can be your silhouette

When you just stop
And take a look around your shop
You may feel your blues all drop
You can't sell your glum to me
But I can help you til' you see
That you can be your silhouette

It may be dark
It may be shadowy and stark
But don't be scared of what you've met
Your dance with it is no threat
In fact it is an asset
You can be your silhouette
