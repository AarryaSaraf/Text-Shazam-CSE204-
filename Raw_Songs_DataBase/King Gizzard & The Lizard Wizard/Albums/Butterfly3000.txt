// Yours //

Did you know he's yours?
He's the wheel you steer
Tomorrow, still yours
You can lean on him forever

He's your man in the sky
Your bird's lullaby
Your dream in a dream
Your blue butterfly
Your winged Frankenstein
Materialized
As a figment of
Dream personified

Did you know he's yours?
Your security
Tomorrow, till yours
You can count on him
Forever, he's yours

Did you know he's yours?
He's the wheel you steer
Tomorrow, still yours
You can lean on him forever

He's your third sleeping eye
Your friend in your mind
Can make a vision
So real and refined
Like lifetime knowledge
Travelling ether
From a godly cloud
To the believer

Did you know he's yours?
When you fall asleep
Tomorrow, still yours
He's a gentle breeze
Forever, he's yours

Did you know he's yours?

// Shanghai //

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, bye bye my life
Born again overnight
Bright lights up high, dark thoughts in my mind
Born again overnight
Bright lights up high, grey smog all the time
Born again overnight

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

Ok, let me my trace my steps
Pour a drink, let's recap the sequence
One minute, you're swigging on a green tea
Next minute, floating on a pillow in a den
From there it gets a little hazy, like a camera out of focus, shaking
Slow motion in the club free-falling through my seat, hit the floor transforming
Undergoing complete metamorphous from a moth caterpillar to a chrysalis
Spinning in a silken house like a spider spins a web
I'm a well known insect

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, bye bye my life
Born again overnight
Bright lights up high, dark thoughts in my mind
Born again overnight
Bright lights up high, grey smog all the time
Born again overnight

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

Flying through the You Garden to the People's Square
That's where you find your happiness
With a little too much Szechuan in the pot, sending sensational content
Neck stuck from looking up at the high rise buildings trying to caress
Enlightenment through an out of body experience
You're thriving in this environment
Come find me on almost every continent
Cold-blooded but I can't stand the Antarctic
Guess I've been born again overnight

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

// Dreams //

I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel awake in the night
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel tired in the day
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna run away
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna run and hide
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only like it when I can't see
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only need the castle in the air
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna keep my eyes glazed
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel alive in a daze
I only wanna wake up in my dream

I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel awake in the night
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel tired in the day
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna run away
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna run and hide
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only like it when I can't see
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only need the castle in the air
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna keep my eyes glazed
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel alive in a daze
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna wake up in my dream

// Blue Morpho //

Falling upwards through clouds of glue
Anamnesis crashing through
Blurry photos all I've gained from my last domain
Dream grips me and pulls me into global unparalleled new
Metamorphic is my name
Surrender this brain

Blue morpho, blue morpho

Falling upwards through clouds of glue
Moonless night beckons me through
Morpheus whispers my name
Massages my brain
Falling upwards through clouds of glue
Split dry sky beckons me through
A hand outstretched calls my name
Time to wake again

Blue morpho, blue morpho, blue morpho

Time to wake again
Blue morpho
Time to wake again
Blue morpho
Time to wake again
Blue morpho
Time to wake again
Blue morpho

// Interior People //

Just on the down low
I'm feeling pretty low
Some days I feel fine
Others, I don't know
I got a sensory road block
I'm in a binary mind lock
So I'm dancing in lockstep
To music that I can't hear, yeah

Failing farmer, toxic crop
Two white hearts to shake shit up
Pay someone to taste, to smell and punch through the dry wall inside my skull

Interior people
A lens flare in my subconscious
The gap of death
I no longer fear
The Interior people

I keep thinking someone
Is standing beside me
But when I turn to grab them
They jump back inside of me
They tell me to do things
And so does the radio
And learn from the satellite
That orbits my shadow, yeah

Instigate the paradigm
Play the game, and drink the wine
Communicate with the afterglow that radiates between the wall
Failing farmer, toxic crop
Two white hearts to shake shit up
Pay someone to taste, to smell and punch through the dry wall inside my skull

Interior people
A lens flare in my subconscious
The gap of death
I no longer fear
The Interior people

Interior people
A lens flare in my subconscious
The gap of death
I no longer fear
The Interior people

// Catching Smoke //

For one night I'm the hero
Suit up, tie
Open the doors to the Oval Office
In this story, I'm president

I've got happiness inside my pocket
It cost me 25 dollars
Maybe we could go halvies?
So gimme just a couple hours
Starting fires with soggy timber
Then, I'll have the magic powers, whoo

Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Swallowing the sun in a moonlit room
Standing at the foot of a rainbow
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake
Sipping on hedonism

Give me 5
It's all I need to inscribe my epitaph
While I float O.B.E.
Am I dead or just paranoid?

I've got happiness inside my pocket
It cost me 25 dollars
Maybe we could go halvies?
So gimme just a couple hours
Starting fires with soggy timber
Then, I'll have the magic powers, whoo

Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Swallowing the sun in a moonlit room
Standing at the foot of a rainbow
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake
Sipping on hedonism

Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke

Hogtied to self-indulgence
Epicureanly living la dolce vita
Just pass the aux. cord

I've got happiness inside my pocket
It cost me 25 dollars
Maybe we could go halvies?

So gimme just a couple hours
Starting fires with soggy timber
Then, I'll have the magic powers, whoo

Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Swallowing the sun in a moonlit room
Standing at the foot of a rainbow

Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake
Sipping on hedonism

Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke

Not enough hours in the night
To keep me on this stinking horse
Everyone's rolling up pineapples
Writhing in the space between it all
Long-live my decisions, whoo

Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke

// 2.02 Killer Year //

Woo!

It's coming up beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper
It's gonna drown everyone
It's coming up beach boys
The weathers getting messed about. You better bring boards down
The waves are bigger than a house

2.02 killer year
No fear, proceed without blame
No shame
Playing games with lives unborn
No scorn
Not torn between just and fucked up. We've stuffed up
Time to pick up

It's coming up beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper
It's gonna drown everyone
It's coming up beach boys
The weathers getting messed about You better bring boards down
The waves are bigger than a house

2.02 killer year
The year that broke our broken wheel
Is it enough that we're a speck of dust, speeding though a void of stuff?
We teeter on an axe edge

Water signage, never read it
How pathetic, coinciding
Mystifying, sleep Declining
Too little, too late to contemplate
Gotta make moves, cannot wait
Need to recreate a clean slate
Plan B, C and D
However many needs it needs to be to keep us free in ecstasy
It's easier to swallow hiding in your burrow
No need to wallow in your sorrows
Woo!

It's coming up beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper
It's gonna drown everyone

// Black Hot Soup //

Seething pot filled with hot liquid up to the top
Spinning ball with molten core of iron ore
What's it for?

Staring out in the dissonance
Black hot soup
Black hot soup in the distance
Black hot soup
Black hot soup engulfing me
Black hot soup

Infinity is in a dream
Inside a dream
You can achieve reality
It gets better
It get's better
Gets better
Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin floating
Above who you have been
It gets better
Gets better when you're with me here in my own reality with ya
Better when you're with me
Better when you're with me
Better when you're with me

Colossal fireball falling for an endless floor
Warming wall is moving blind to open shores and open minds

Staring out in the dissonance
Black hot soup
Black hot soup in the distance
Black hot soup
Black hot soup engulfing me
Black hot soup

Infinity is in a dream inside a dream you can achieve reality
It gets better
It get's better
Gets better
Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin floating
Above who you have been
It gets better
Gets better when you're with me here in my own reality with ya
Better when you're with me
Better when you're with me
Better when you're with me

Staring out in the dissonance
Black hot soup
Black hot soup in the distance
Black hot soup
Black hot soup engulfing me
Black hot soup
Black hot soup

Infinity is in a dream inside a dream you can achieve reality
It gets better
It get's better
Gets better
Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin floating
Above who you have been
It gets better
Gets better when you're with me here in my own reality with ya
Better when you're with me
Better when you're with me
Better when you're with me

Black hot soup
Black hot soup...
Black hot soup
Black hot soup...

Hope that I am worthy of your love
Hope I am deserving of your love
Hope you can brush off the powers that be
Hope I can empower femininity

Hope I can teach you how to be mostly happy
Hope you don't let the world crush you
For it is beautiful out there and there's a lot to see
Hope I can teach you to see the splendor of the moment
Hope you can see the beauty within the grim world's ugly mess
