// Ants And Bats //

Ants and bats
Dusts and pulls
Slalom here
Stay at home, wooh!

A dirty bear
Is all I need
His tired eyes
Will help me sleep

Ants and bats
Dusts and pulls
Slalom here
Stay at home

A dirty bear
Is all I need
His tired eyes
Will help me sleep

// Sleep //

One, two, three, four

Ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo

I got up early
And you've got up too
And you pull me under
And you say "My leg"
But I don't wanna go back to sleep again
But I don't wanna stay like this for five more minutes

And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up

Ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo
Ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo

And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, woo

I got up early
And you got up early
And you pull me under
And you say "My leg"
Ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo
Ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo

It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too

It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too

It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too

It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too
It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too
It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too
It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too
