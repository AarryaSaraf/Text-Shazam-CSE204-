Came in my window crying
Said that she's sick of all his lying about me
I said I ain't got time for her
I'm gonna close the door when I go walking

Out, out, out, out

Came to me Monday Morning
Interrupted me in my mid-morning yawning
He said the same thing that she said
Well I just turned to him and said that she ain't

Mine, mine, mine, mine

Baby you always acted like, baby you never cared
With the way you act girl, you're bound to make your guy

Cry, cry, cry, cry

I ain't gonna be the one to watch you fall down the stairs
With the way you act girl, you're bound to make your guy

Cry, cry, cry, cry
