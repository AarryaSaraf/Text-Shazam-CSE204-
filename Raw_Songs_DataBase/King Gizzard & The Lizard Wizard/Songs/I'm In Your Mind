Everybody's lazy when they're tired
Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride
And everybody's filing into line
Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride

When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind, oh

While everybody wants to suck you dry
And dig a little deeper in your mind
C'mon, deeper
Everybody's lazy because they're fried
Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride

When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind, oh
When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind, oh
