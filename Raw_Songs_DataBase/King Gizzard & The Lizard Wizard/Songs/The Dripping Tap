The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Suits in charge of the world and our
Futures hanging on by a thread
With our heads in the sand
The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Gods up above us, Big Sky Country
That we never hear from in these
Times of our dying needs

A familiar sound ignored
The compartmentalized thoughts
In that back corner of the drawer
That drip, drip on the floor
Don't get drowned
Hee hee hee, woo!
Heed that sound
Hee hee hee, woo!

Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on, wish I learnt how to swim
Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on

Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on, wish I learnt how to swim
Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on

The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Suits in charge of the world and our
Futures hanging on by a thread
With our heads in the sand
(Woo!)

Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip

Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip

Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip

Everybody's on the same orbit
When they get old and moronic
Get complacent and get bored
That drip, drip on the floor
Don't get drowned
Hee hee hee, woo!
Heed that sound
Hee hee hee, woo!

Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on, wish I learnt how to swim
Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on

The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Suits in charge of the world and our
Futures hanging on by a thread
With our heads in the sand
The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Gods up above us, Big Sky Country
