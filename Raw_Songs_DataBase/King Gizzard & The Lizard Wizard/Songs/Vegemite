I love, I love my Vegemite
It's strong as hell and black as night
I keep my love all screwed up tight
And spread it thick whenever I like, I like

Vegemite
I like Vegemite
I like, I like

And when everyone's getting grumpy cos it's early
I'll have breakfast with my girlfriend
And we'll have toast with avocados
And tomatoes and Vegemite

Cos I love, I love my Vegemite
It's strong as hell and black as night
I keep my love all screwed up tight
And spread it thick whenever I like, I like

Vegemite
I like Vegemite
I like, I like
