God gave me a sign
He put it in my glass of wine
A great theophany
He told me every sinner had to die

And telepaths 
We are the sacrifice
Like it or not
I live by the book

These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless
The book
The book
The book

God gave me a knife
And wrote seppuku underlined
Godly suicide
He told me everyone will die
So judge me by the page
But  not by my cover
 with age
Like it or not
I live by the book

These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless
The book
The book
The book

These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless
The book
The book
The book
