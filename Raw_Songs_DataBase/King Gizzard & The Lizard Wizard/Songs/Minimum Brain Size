Riddle me this, did you ever grow?
Break the spider's legs just to feed the crow
Sympathetic crowds are not well endowed
They dance flies on shit, swarming in the cloud

This is to all of the people who had it coming
A few biccys too many, I'm so lonely
It's to all of the people who said they couldn't hack it
I'll open their eyes
To minimum brain size

Re-enter the uterus and refund all your cells
Do it back-to-front like nobody else
Stay there for a while, "When you're back inside
You will not be missed," said the tear to the eye

It's pathetic though, you're weaker than you know
Parasitic mob, faceless undertow
Himpathetic bro, you're weaker than you know
You don't have a say a-a-anymore

This is to all of the people who had it coming
A few biccys too many, I'm so lonely
It's to all of the people who said they couldn't hack it
Radicalise
To minimum brain size

It's pathetic though, you're weaker than you know
Parasitic mob, no worse off alone
Himpathetic bro, you're weaker than you know
You don't have a say a-a-anymore

At the centre of it all, you ain't got the gall
You're pissing on a flame, standing on a ball
It's pathetic though, you're weaker than you know
You don't have a say a-a-anymore

A-a-anymore
