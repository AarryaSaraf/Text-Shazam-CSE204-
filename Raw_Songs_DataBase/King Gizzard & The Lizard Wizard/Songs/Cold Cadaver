Dark and cold
Out my front window
I can hear her say
From two miles away

"This can't be over, can't be over"
Heard her before
Knocking at my front door
I said "What's the problem?"
She said "It's the cold cadaver, cadaver"
"Cold cadaver, cadaver!"

I was sleeping
When I heard her preaching

I said "What's the problem?"
She said "It's the cold cadaver, cadaver"
"Cold cadaver, cadaver!"

My tongue is big
But not as big as his
Nostrils, mouth and ears
Start to disappear

"This can't be over, can't be over"
Heard me before
Banging on her front door
She said "What's the problem?"
I said "It's the cold cadaver, cadaver"
"Cold cadaver, cadaver!"
"Cold cadaver, cadaver!"
"Cold cadaver, cadaver!"
"Cold cadaver, cadaver!"
"Cold cadaver, cadaver!"
