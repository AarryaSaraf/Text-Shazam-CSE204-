God it's pretty hot down here
Undersurface
Anti-Christ has tempted me
With a purpose

Remember where to enter
Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!

Here I was thinking I'd die
I see a thousand flies and wings and tail and spines
Nausea-less, resoluteness near the entrance
Satan points me to the rats' nest

Remember where to enter
Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!

Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!

Fifteen infantry paratroop into the propylene new scene
Hell's where they wanna be!
Infest the rats' nest
