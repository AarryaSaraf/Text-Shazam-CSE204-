Galvanising uncertainty
Mindful of the weary inkling that is lurking
Hierarchy it's been cracking aegis
Embodied in this black heart shameless

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim
I can see the beelzebub Cheshire grin

Cooking something raw, cooking something big
Pandemonium, selfish pigs
Headless chickens scared shitless
The media, will never quit

Allegro fuelled with discontent
Mortal traffic lights signalling when to stay or go
Condescending expendables botched to a clock
Novice to the dilemma with nothing clever left in stock

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim
I can hear Hell's kitchen and they're singing hymns

Cooking something raw, cooking something big
Pandemonium, selfish pigs
Headless chickens scared shitless
The media, will never quit

The affluent with a bad omen hanging
Monstrosity scarce breaking freedom
Shrewd and not in the mood to disillude
We are the pillars of a forgotten pier

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?

Is it all, is it all straws in the wind?
Is it all, is it all straws in the wind?
Is it all, is it all straws in the wind?
Is it all, is it all straws in the wind?

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim
I can see the beelzebub Cheshire grin
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
