Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong

Fuck all of that plastic (Fuck all of that plastic)
Wrapped up in my dinner (Wrapped up in my diner)
It's not fantastic (It's not fantastic)
It's gonna come and kill us (It's gonna come and kill us)
It's gonna be massive (It's gonna be massive)
It's gonna be brutal (It's gonna be brutal)
Death will come from plastic (Death will come from plastic)
Death will come from people (Death will come from people)

Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong

Fuck all of those plastic
Particles in the ocean
It's like a vendetta
Against our Mother Nature

The way we wrap it
The way we wrap it is wrong
We wrap it
Plastic boogie
We wrap it
The way we wrap it
The way we wrap it
Plastic boogie
Plastic boogie
The way we wrap it
The way we wrap it is wrong
We wrap it
Plastic boogie
We wrap it
The way we wrap it
The way we wrap it
Plastic boogie
Plastic boogie

Plastic boogie

Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh the way we wrap it is wrong

Fuck all of that plastic
