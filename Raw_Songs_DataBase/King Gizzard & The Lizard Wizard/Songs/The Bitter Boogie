Bitter, bitter, bitter...

The bitter boogie comes without a warning
When it's inside of me it is exhausting
I don't like the way it makes me freeze up
And what it makes me say
I know it comes off bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter
But roll with it

Bitter, bitter, bitter...

I wouldn't like to say I didn't warn ya
'Cause bitter boogie comes without a warning
I really hate the way it mess' my mind up
And all it makes me say
I know it comes off bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter
But roll with it

Bitter, bitter, bitter...

From the first glance, had no chance
Making exceptions
That would outlast, searching for a new obsession
Yet I'm too bitter to reconsider
My options twice
Before I ask for your advice

Bitter, bitter, bitter...

I've been grieving for no reason
That seems wise
Married to the pipe
With no ambition besides
I'm too bitter to reconsider
My options twice
Before I ask for your advice

Bitter, bitter, bitter...
