Bedtime for the birds as night cloaks the earth
Then the moon smiles at the sun's birth
Faceless night cowers underneath
The ever-changing moonlit sky
Can you believe the way night falls away
As the sun starts a new day?

Plants raise their leaves as the sun waves goodbye
Dusk greets the horizon as day fades
Black lines bend round a cityscape
While trailing off in the sunset's wake
I can foresee that dawn will bring the light
As the sun gives way to night
