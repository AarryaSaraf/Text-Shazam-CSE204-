If not now, then when?
When the forest's nearly gone.
When the hole's in the ozone.
When the bees are gone.
If not now, then when?
When the ocean's coming up.
When the rain just won't stop.
When the fire's burning.
If not now, then when?

If not now, then when?
When big pharma's rippin' me.
When my data's tracking me.
When my phone is spying.
If not now, then when?
When my choice is monitored.
When computers are cleverer.
When our food is poison.
If not now, then...

This is an emergency.
Need to act more quickly.
This is no quandary.
This is an emergency.

This is an emergency.
Need to act more quickly.
This is no quandary.
This is an emergency.

When the oceans turn to black.
When the animals are dead.
When the birds are gone.
If not now, then when?
When the blue sky turns into black.
When Gaia hangs by a thread.
When all the people die.
If not now, then when?
