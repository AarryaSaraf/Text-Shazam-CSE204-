Falling upwards through clouds of glue
Anamnesis crashing through
Blurry photos all I've gained from my last domain
Dream grips me and pulls me into global unparalleled new
Metamorphic is my name
Surrender this brain

Blue morpho, blue morpho

Falling upwards through clouds of glue
Moonless night beckons me through
Morpheus whispers my name
Massages my brain
Falling upwards through clouds of glue
Split dry sky beckons me through
A hand outstretched calls my name
Time to wake again

Blue morpho, blue morpho, blue morpho

Time to wake again
Blue morpho
Time to wake again
Blue morpho
Time to wake again
Blue morpho
Time to wake again
Blue morpho
