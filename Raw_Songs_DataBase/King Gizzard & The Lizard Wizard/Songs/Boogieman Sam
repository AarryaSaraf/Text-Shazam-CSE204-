Well, up jumped the Boogieman
He ate mothers' babies
He shot the policeman
And went down to the nightclub
And shocked all the patrons
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman
With a rope in his hand

Causing mayhem
'Cause he's the Boogieman
Causing mayhem
'Cause he's Boogieman Sam
(Boogieman Sam)

Well, up jumped the Boogieman
He stole from a punter
His ashes, he wanted it
To blow holes in the floorboards
And danced like a demon and
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman
With a rope in his hand

Causing mayhem
'Cause he's the Boogieman
Bottoms up, flailing
'Cause he's the Boogieman
(Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogieman)
Doing damage
'Cause he's the Boogieman
(Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogie)
He's a blemish
'Cause he's Boogieman Sam
(Boogieman Sam)

Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
