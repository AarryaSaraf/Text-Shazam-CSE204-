Venusian 1

Forest desertified
Ocean wave amplify
Constant tornado sky
Black water no supply
Otherworld, surrogate
Interstellar our escape
Sulfur star liberates
Gotta beat the outbreak

Oh, we're going to the second planet from the sun
Oh, our ship can deliver us from our ruin

Death admirer
Ground of fire
I heard there's a holy yellow sky
Just make sure you close your eyes
Venusian 1

Made of junk from the Earth
Human waste, how absurd
Journey is childbirth
Plant a flag, start a church
Sharp as ice in the night
Cutting space, satellite
To a sphere set alight
We escaped parasites

Oh, we're going to the second planet from the sun
Oh, our ship can deliver us from our ruin

Floating helium
Blimp of freedom
Outside air will bring you death
Just make sure you hold your breath

Ve-nu-si-an 1

I heard there's a holy yellow sky (Ve-nu-si-)
Just make sure you close eyes (an 1)
Outside air will bring your death (Ve-nu-si-)
Just make sure you hold your breath (an 1)

There is one planet V
