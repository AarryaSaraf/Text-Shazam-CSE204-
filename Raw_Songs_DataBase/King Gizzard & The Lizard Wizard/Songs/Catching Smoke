For one night I'm the hero
Suit up, tie
Open the doors to the Oval Office
In this story, I'm president

I've got happiness inside my pocket
It cost me 25 dollars
Maybe we could go halvies?
So gimme just a couple hours
Starting fires with soggy timber
Then, I'll have the magic powers, whoo

Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Swallowing the sun in a moonlit room
Standing at the foot of a rainbow
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake
Sipping on hedonism

Give me 5
It's all I need to inscribe my epitaph
While I float O.B.E.
Am I dead or just paranoid?

I've got happiness inside my pocket
It cost me 25 dollars
Maybe we could go halvies?
So gimme just a couple hours
Starting fires with soggy timber
Then, I'll have the magic powers, whoo

Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Swallowing the sun in a moonlit room
Standing at the foot of a rainbow
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake
Sipping on hedonism

Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke

Hogtied to self-indulgence
Epicureanly living la dolce vita
Just pass the aux. cord

I've got happiness inside my pocket
It cost me 25 dollars
Maybe we could go halvies?

So gimme just a couple hours
Starting fires with soggy timber
Then, I'll have the magic powers, whoo

Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Swallowing the sun in a moonlit room
Standing at the foot of a rainbow

Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake
Sipping on hedonism

Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke

Not enough hours in the night
To keep me on this stinking horse
Everyone's rolling up pineapples
Writhing in the space between it all
Long-live my decisions, whoo

Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
Catching smoke
