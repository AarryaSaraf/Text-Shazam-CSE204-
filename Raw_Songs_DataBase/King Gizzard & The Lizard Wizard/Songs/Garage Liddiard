My head, oh my head
My head's all bleak
And it makes my love so rough
My knees, oh my knees
My knees are weak
And it makes for walking tough

Ow! Ow! Ow!...

My head, oh my head
My head's all bleak
And it makes my love so rough
My knees, oh my knees
My knees are weak
And it makes for walking tough

Ow! Ow! Ow!... Ouch!...
