How can anybody see me when I am invisible and
How can anybody be the friend of someone impossible?
How can everything in my sight be so far into the distance?
How can everyday I survive turn so easily to night?

How can any body see me?
I'm invisible
How can any body see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore

How can anybody see me when I am a hidden person?
How on earth can someone like me be intangible to others?
How do all the people do the things that people do around me?
How can anybody move when our planet is suffocating?

How can anybody see me?
I'm invisible (See me)
How can anybody see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore (See me)

How can any body see me?
I'm invisible (See me)
How can any body see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore (See me)

See me, see me, see me, see me
See me
