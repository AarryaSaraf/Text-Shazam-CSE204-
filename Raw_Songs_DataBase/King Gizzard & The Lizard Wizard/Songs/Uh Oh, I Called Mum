Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum, oh!

Uh oh...
I called mum!

I bought a funny glob
I put it in my gob
I had anxiety
I couldn't help myself
But call mum, oh!

Uh oh...
I called mum!

Mum mum mum...

I bought a funny glob
I put it in my gob
I had anxiety
I couldn't help myself
But call mum, oh!

Uh oh...
I called mum!
Uh oh...
I called mum!

Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum-mum-mum-mum-mum!
