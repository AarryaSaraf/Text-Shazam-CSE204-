I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour

Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy

I'm back to birth
I see the light
Even in my face
My brain keeps information
Now I'm a god in a photon
I see through walls
I see your heat
I can see your terror
Can see your future

I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour
I can see, tetrachromacy
I see the fourth colour

Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy
Seen green and Tiona has me
But I will be
Third eye is free
I am not a body
Tetrachromacy

I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour

I'm back to birth
I see the light
Even in my face
I analyze information
Now I am a god
