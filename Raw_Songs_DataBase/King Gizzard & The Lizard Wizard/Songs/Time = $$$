Well if time is money
Then it sounds funny
To give me so much time
And no money nearby

I know when my gums start bleeding
And pissing over my teeth
That I'm low on my buck
Without any luck
And all I gotta say

Why is time my money
'Cause it sounds funny
To give me so much time
And no money nearby

I know when my eyes start itching
That I'm in need of a fuss
And I'm low on my buck
Without any luck
Head in my hands
To see that I am so stuck
And all I gotta say, all I got to say

Why is time money
'Cause it sounds funny
To give me so much time
And no money nearby
Time is money, time is money
Time is money, time is money
