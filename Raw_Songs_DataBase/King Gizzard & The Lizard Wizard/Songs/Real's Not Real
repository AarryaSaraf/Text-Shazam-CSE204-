What in the world is going on?
That pretty picture's looking wrong
If happy is all you wanna be
Then I can see that the painting ain't painted with love
What in the world is going on here?
Your past is built upon your fear
And happy is what you'll never be
I'm afraid that you're lacking some free will
Your real's not real
Your real's not real
What in the world is going on?
Can't we all just get along?
Our candy is melting in the sun
Can anyone be a martyr from hereafter?
What in the world is going on now?
Your farm is full of sacred cow
And happy is what you'll never be
I'm afraid that you're lacking some free will
Your real's not real
Your real's not real
