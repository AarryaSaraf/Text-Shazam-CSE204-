Cyboogie, boogie, boogie
Cyboogie
Cyboogie

Cyboogie, a hunk of rebar
Multitude cells in his brittle dome
Black fluid floating within
Flows between nodes in his cursed soul
Cyboogie, augmented senses
Scholarship broke off a celebration
Mind wasn't a consciousness can
Bouncy ball thoughts in his silicon chip

Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Cyboogie
Cyboogie

Cyboogie's heart is a mess
Cables in knots in his cavity chest
Cyboogie's feeling depressed
Need to debug and run over the tests
Cyboogie's tinkering flesh
Pistons and pumps at the creepy front desk
No people deserve the mess
When he breaks down it's broken to bits

Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie

Cyboogie, lump in his throat
Palpitations and the heat I exhume
Cyboogie born to be
Terminal error in human tissue
Cyboogie's fishing for fishies
Pickling trout in a binary brook
How is it that he is depressed
The humans have pierced through his cheek with a hook

Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie boogie

Cyboogie (Cyboogie, cyboogie)
Cyboogie (Cyboogie, cyboogie)
Cyboogie (Cyboogie, cyboogie)
Cyboogie (Dance with the devil)
Cyboogie (Go forth)
Cyboogie (Boogie, boogie, boogie!)
Cyboogie (Now the stars watch their silhouettes)
Cyboogie (They left Africa dancing)
Cyboogie (Their apex was dance)
Cyboogie (They existed for two hundred thousand years)
(...Thousand years)
Cyboogie
