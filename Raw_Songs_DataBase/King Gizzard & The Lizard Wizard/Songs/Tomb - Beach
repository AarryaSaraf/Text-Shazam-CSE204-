Wooooo, woooooo

Lie in the whirl
Makes you hurt
Lie in the sky
Makes you high

In my tomb, in my tomb
In my tomb, in my tomb

Lie in the whirl
Makes you hurt
Lie in the sky
Makes you high

In my tomb, in my tomb
In my tomb, in my tomb

Going down, now
To the beach, now
You look fine, yeah
Like a beach, yeah
Going down, now
To the beach, now
You look fine, yeah
Like a beach, yeah
