// He's Got All The Whiskey //

He's got all the whiskey
He's got all the whiskey
He's got all the whiskey, still won't give me none

He's got all the money
He's got all the money
He's got all the money, but he just won't give me none

He's got all the women
He's got all the women
He's got all the women, but he doesn't give me one

He's got all the power
He's got all the power
He's got all the power, he won't give me none

Now he's got religion
He's even got religion
He's even got religion, but he just can't teach me one

He's got all the whiskey
He's got all the whiskey
He's got all the whiskey, won't give me none
Won't give me none; not even won't give me none

// God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind) //

Cain slew Abel, Seth knew not why
For if the children of Israel are supposed to multiply
Why must any children die?
So he asked the Lord
And the Lord said

Man means nothing, he means even less to me
Than the lowliest cactus flower
Or the humblest Yucca tree
Chases round the desert
Chasing after me, thinks he might find me but
Lord that's why I love mankind
So stupid
I recoil in horror at the fondness of thee
From the squalor and the filth are your misery
How we laugh up here in heaven at the prayers you offer me
That is why I just love mankind

The Christians and the Jews, they had a great big jamboree
The Buddhists and the Hindus joined in on satellite TV
They picked their four greatest priests
They began to speak; they said

Plague is on the world
Lord, no man is free
The temples that we built to you
They just tumble into the sea
Lord, if you won't take care of us
Please, let us be?

And the Lord said
And the Lord said
I burn down your cities; how blind you must be
I take away your children; you say: how blessed are we
You all must be crazy to God in there to put your faith in a man like me
That's why I love mankind
That is why I love
That's why I love you mankind

// How Fortunate The Man With None //

You saw sagacious Solomon
And you know what became of him
To him, complexities seemed plain
But he cursed the hour that gave birth to his bad self
He saw that everything was vain
How great, how wise was Solomon
The world however did not wait
Just observed what followed on
It was the wisdom, that brought him to that state
Sweet wisdom, that brought him to that state
It was only wisdom, that brought him to that state
So how fortunate the man with none

You saw courageous Caesar next
You know what he let himself become
They deified him in his life
And had him murdered just the same
As they raised the fatal knife
How loud he cried: and you
The world however did not care
Just observed, carried on
It was courage that brought him to that state
It was courage that brought him to this state
Raw courage that brought him to that state
Well I might say, how fortunate the man with none
Could say

You heard of honest Socrates
He was a man who never lied
They weren't so grateful as you might think
The rulers fixed to have him tried
They handed him the poisoned drink
How honest was our people's son
This world however did not choose to wait
Just observed what followed on
It was his honesty that brought him to that state
Sweet honesty that brought him to that state
Sweet honesty that brought him to that state
How fortunate the man with some

Here you can see the respectable folk
They all keep to God's own laws
So far he has not taken heed
You who sit safe and sound indoors
Help to relieve our bitter needs
How virtuously we had begun
The world however will never wait
Just observes to carry on
It's fear of God that brought us to this state
It is the love of God that will take us home
It is the fear of God that brought us to this state
How fortunate the man with no fear
Got no fear

// Small Town Talk //

It's only small town talk
You know how people are
They can't stand to see you
Being who you are

It's only small town talk
Don't pay it no mind
Don't believe a word they say
They do it to you every time

You can't believe everything you hear
Only half of what you might see
But if you have to believe in anyone
I'd believe, darling, believe in me

It's only small town talk
A well-known fact
You don't even know
How one other might react
To what you're thinking
What are they thinking

It's only small town talk
They're telling all the lies
And make some people crazy
They don't realize we're still thinking

We're only people, trying to live together
We're trying to make this little life work
Who are we to judge one another
It may lead to tears or maybe something even worse

It's only small town talk
You know how people are
They can't stand to see you
Being just exactly who you are

It's small town talk
Pittle, pattle, it's small town talk
Tittle, tattle, it's small town talk

// Excuse Me Mister //

Excuse me mister, do you have the time?
Or are you so important that it stands still for you
Excuse me mister, lend me your ear
Are you not only blind but are you scared to hear?

Excuse me mister, is that oil in the sea
Pollution in the air, mister what could that be
Excuse me mister, I'm a mister too
There's misters like you, giving me a bad name

I'm taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you that put the rest of us to shame
I'm taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, that give me a bad name
Giving me a bad name... sweet love

Excuse me mister, can't you see the children dying
You say that you can help them; you're not even trying
Excuse me mister, take a look around
Mister just look up, and you will see what's coming down

Oh, taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, that give me a bad name
Yes I'm taking the mister right out of your name
Misters like you that put the rest of us to shame
I'm taking the mister out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, giving misters like me, a bad name
You're giving me, a bad name

Mister, mister, when you're rattling on heaven's gate
Let me tell you mister, then it's going to be too late
Oh mister, mister, when you get there
They don't care how much you saved
They want to know how much you gave away

Excuse me mister, I'm a mister too
You're giving me a bad name
A mister like you, you fool

Taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, that give me a bad name
Come on, taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, give me a bad name
Taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, that keep giving me a bad name

Excuse me mister
Please excuse me mister
Excuse me mister, do you have the time
Or are you so important that it stands still for you
Excuse me mister lend me your ear

// Strange Fruit //

Southern trees bear strange fruit
There's blood on the leaves
There's blood at the roots
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
There's strange fruit hanging from the poplar tree

The scenic view of the quiet south
Those bulging eyes, the twisted mouth
The scent of magnolia comes as sweet and fresh
Suddenly: the stench of black burning flesh
Now here my friends
Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
A tear for the rain to gather
The roaring wind to suck
For the sun to rise
And those trees to drop
And I hear there's a strange and bitter crop

// The Sky Is Crying //

The sky is crying
Look at the tears rolling down the street
I'm telling you, the sky is crying
Look at those tears rolling down the streets
You came to survive
Oh boy we're here to meet

I got a bad feeling
Bad feeling, my baby done me wrong
I got a bad, bad feeling
I believe there's been an infringement here
The sky keeps crying
But the air don't clear

Me and my baby â€“ the sky is crying
Through the tears rolling down the streets
I'm telling you, the sky itself is crying
Look at the tears roll down the streets
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
Oh, where can you go, I tell you move too far
I swear I don't know

// Glory Box //

Get so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and this arrow here
I'm going to give my heart away
And leave it to the other boys out there to play
I've been tempted too long
Going

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason, if you can

From this time unchained
We are looking at a different picture
Through a different frame of mind
A thousand flowers may bloom
Wouldn't it be time to move over
Move over, give me some room

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man
Give me a reason to love you
Please, one reason if you can

Don't you start looking like some woman
Take a little look from the outside, if you can
Move over me now, try a little tenderness
A little shabby dress, I wouldn't care
Only cry for you, cry for you
Might die for you too

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man
Give me a reason to love you
Oh please, give me reason if you can

Since the beginning of forever
Forever and ever and ever and ever
It's time to move over now
I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and this arrow
I'm going to give my heart away
And going to leave it to the other boys to play
I've been tempted too long, too long
I've been tempted every day
I've been tempted too long

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man
Give me a reason to love you, to love you
Give me a reason, if you can
Reason if you can

// Feel So Bad //

Feel so bad, like a ball game on a rainy day
I'm telling you, I feel so bad, just like a ball game on a rainy day
Since I lost my baby
I had to shake my head
Shake my head and walk away

Sometimes I want to stay here
Then again I think, I believe I want to leave
Believe I might want to leave
Sometimes I want to stay here
Tomorrow I might leave
But maybe I want to stay
I just can't make my mind up
Shake my head, then want to walk way

I'm trying to tell you people
Tell you just how I feel
Yes I keep trying to tell all you people
Exactly how I feel
Feel so bad inside, yes I do
My baby gave me dirty deal

I feel so bad, worse than a ball game on a rainy day
Yes I do, I feel so bad
I feel worse than a ball game on a rainy, rainy day
Since the day I lost my darling
I swear, I shake my head, I walk away

Sometimes I want to stay here, but
Then again I think I want to leave
Sometimes I want to stay here, but
Then again I want to leave, I just can't make my mind up
I'm telling you: I got my clothes, they're packed and ready
I waiting for that one, little ready steady
I gotta go, I'm feeling lonely
Oh I've been coming down so bad I'm lonely now, it's worse
I don't care if it rains in your ball game
May it rain in the ball game
Don't care if it rains in the ball game
It always rains in the ball game

// Death Don't Have No Mercy //

Death don't have no mercy in this land
Death don't have no mercy in this land
It comes to your house, it won't stay long
Somebody will be gone, 'cause
Death don't have no mercy in our land

Death will go into any family in this land, I know him
Death comes into any family in this land
He's going to come in your family
He won't stay long
Look in your bed, and you'll be gone
Wake up dead

Death don't have no mercy in this land
Death don't have no mercy in this land
One night, you go to bed
The very next morning going to wake up dead
Because Father Death has got no mercy at all

Never takes a vacation in our land
Death don't take no vacation
He'll come to your house but he won't stay long
Look in the bedroom, mother will be gone
I swear, he's got no mercy in this land

He'll leave you, standing and crying in this land
Death will leave you, standing alone and crying in this land
He'll come to your house, he won't stay long
Look in the bed, someone else is gone
Death don't have mercy in our land

Death's always in a hurry, I understand
Death's always in a hurry, I can understand
He won't give you time to get ready
He won't even say, ready, steady go
You gotta go when it comes
Cos he's got no mercy in this land
Who cares
Got no mercy in this land
Death's got no mercy in this land
