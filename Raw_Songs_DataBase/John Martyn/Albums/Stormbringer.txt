// Go Out And Get It //

I believe in a minute for every man
When he must take notice of the clock and all its hands
If he sees the road leads straight ahead
Got to run on down, never never be afraid
And it's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people that made you cry

I know a man, six feet tall
Buckskin jacket, velvet stripes and all
From Boston town, educated well
And he keeps his mind within a padded shell
It's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people that made you cry

Behind the curtain, upon the shelf
Lives a man, living with himself
Behind his eyes, behind his smile
What's going on, nobody in the world can tell
It's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people that made you cry

It's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people that made you cry

// Can't Get The One I Want //

I'm feeling down
My senses are bound
Cos I can't get the one I want to
Can't get the one I want to

Don't ask me the time
My watch doesn't wind
I neglected my taste
And I'm drinking cheap wine
Cos I can't get the one I want to love

So I'm just biding my time
Drunk is drunk
The wine is just fine

There's so many people
Trying to get to
Get to the one they want to
Get to the one they want to
Get to the one they want to love

So I'm just biding my time
Till I see you again
The wine will do fine
I can't get the one I want to
I can't get the one I want to, oh
I can't get the one I want to love
Love...

// Stormbringer! //

Time's gone by
Calendar leaves and snows fly
I might write a poem
If I could think of the words to try
What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
She never looked around at all
All I saw was shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
She never looked around at all
All I heard was snow that had to fall

She left in the morning
Quietly that was her way
And on returning
To find I had nothing to say
What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
She never looked around at all
All I saw was shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
She never looked around at all
All I heard was snow that had to fall...

// Sweet Honesty //

Talk of making love
Take your time to bluff your way to stay
Let me use your eyes
Please don't muse with words that cut me down to size
With your lovely mind never taking time to treat a woman kind

You remain to me a vision of sweet honesty
Sweet honesty, sweet honesty, sweet honesty

Do I need to say
That I'm wiser with surprise for? power? in your eyes?
Morning sets the scene
The more you stay, the more you go for me, it seems
With your lovely mind never taking time to treat a woman kind

// Woodstock //

Perch trees, pine trees, oh there're many kind trees
Sparrows, marrows and all those things
Butterflies flutter by everybody's upper by
Even the man next door can sing

Kicking up the cones and rolling up the stones
Kicking up the stones and rolling up the cones

The band plays country, cool and sweet
Everywhere you go
The people tumble down the street
No one that you know

Sunshine, soon shine, let me in the moonshine
Give me the road and set me free
Own up, grown up, everything is sewn up
State police can't bother me

Kicking up the cones and rolling up the stones
Kicking up the stones and rolling up the cones

The band plays country, cool and sweet
Everywhere you go
The people tumble down the street
Everyone you know

Jed the woodchuck, lives in Woodstock
Maybe he's a groundhog and I don't know
Winter freeze up, seize up, knees up
Summers and its time to go

Kicking up the cones and rolling up the stones
Kicking up the stones and rolling up the cones

The band plays country, cool and sweet
Everywhere you go
The people tumble down the street
Everyone you know

// John The Baptist //

I'm John the baptist and this is my friend Salome
And you can bet it's my head she wants and not my heart only
If you see me smiling and you wonder why
You can bet it's a private joke between her and I

And it's all alright
Everything's alright
Alright
Everything's alright

She dances for me in the midnight moon
And when I play for her she never sings too soon
When my head's cut off and I'm lying on the plate
I'm going to grin and tell myself it's been a lovely wait

With the revelations granted and my face just? like a? haunted
See myself on the nursery wall on a poster reading 'Wanted'
And there's a big reward for bringing me in
And I know in my very heart I committed no sin

// The Ocean //

Saw the ocean
Said of it
Nothing's bigger than this
Took the sea flowers
From the sand
Held the shells in my hand

Let it be the
Let it be the friend
Oh let the sea my troubles mend
Let the sea
Let the sea
Let the sea my troubles mend

Let the wind
Blow through my hair
A speck of dust is standing there
Yes I saw the ocean
Said of it
Nothing's bigger than this

Let it be the
Let it be the friend
Let the sea my troubles mend
Let the sea
Let the sea
Let the sea my troubles mend

// Traffic-Light Lady //

All we had between us was a secret
And kept for just us two for just just now
If you tell nobody our se-secret
I'll pick you up and we'll go rollin' now

Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Amber, green and red surprise
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me

Won't you tell me 'bout the things that are you?
Won't you tell me 'bout your baby too?
Tell me 'bout the things you do together
And tell me 'bout the things that we could do

Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Amber, green and red surprise
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me

All we had between us was a secret
And kept for just us two for just just now
If you tell nobody our se-secret
I'll pick you up and we'll go rollin' now

Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Amber, green and red surprise
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me

// Tomorrow Time //

Tomorrow time, tomorrow time
Morning's here, sounds so clear
Birds are singing, music's ringing
Sitting on the floor, can't stay awake no more
It's tomorrow time, tomorrow time

Oh, what's your story, morning glory
Sun-shadows fall all against my wall
Just my room and me and morning, that makes three
It's tomorrow time, tomorrow time

Oh, here so soon, afternoon
With half-closed eyes, I see the skies
Sun is shining still, it'll keep on shining till
Tomorrow time, tomorrow time

// Would You Believe Me? //

Would you believe me if I told you
For four long years you kept the wolf from my door
For four long years you kept my feet upon the floor
And now you're crying
Would you believe me if I told you
That my mind had changed me
That I rearranged me
And now you're crying

And it's a long, long way
It's such a long, long way
So many turnings, so many turnings

Would you believe me if I told you
That I'm sorry for the logic in the lies
That I've found by complete surprise
The truth
Would you believe me if I told you
That I didn't want to lose you
That's why I had to bruise you
So sad

And it's a long, long way
It's such a long, long way
So many turnings, so many turnings

Would you believe me if I told you
When I said that I could marry you
I surely didn't mean to carry you
To here
Would you believe me if I told you
That at twenty years young and all
You simply have got no control
Of the time

And it's a long, long way
Such a long, long way
So many turnings, so many turnings

Would you believe me if I told you
For four long years you kept the wolf from my door
For four long years you kept my feet upon the floor
And now you're crying

// One Of Those Days //

Rain clouds are forming
Darken my room
Winter you're here so soon

And you've tried to see him
Tried in despair
He's got his mind elsewhere

Know how we love him
And oh how you care
Love is so hard to bare

Just one of those days
Another one of those days
Just one of those days
Another one of those days

I see you coming and now I'm alive
I see you coming and now I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive

And you don't even write
And you don't even call
Won't take the chance to fall

And you've tried to see him
Tried in despair
He's got his mind elsewhere

Rain clouds are forming
See them darken my room
Winter you're here so soon

Just one of those days
Another one of those days
Just one of those days
Another one of those days

I see you coming and now I'm alive
I see you coming and now I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive

// I Don't Know //

Bet you never saw me be a horse
That's because I never was of course
But it all seems worthwhile
I can just see you smile like you do
Like you do today

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

I love you lady
Don't you know lady
I love you

Bet you never saw me climb a tree
That's because it isn't me
But it all seems worthwhile
I can just see you smile like you do
Like you do today

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

I love you lady
Lady I love you
I fly a yard and crawl a mile
If I could think of something else meanwhile
It all seems so true if I could be like you
Like I was, like I was today

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

I love you lady
Don't you know lady
I love you

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

I love you lady
Don't you know lady
I love you
