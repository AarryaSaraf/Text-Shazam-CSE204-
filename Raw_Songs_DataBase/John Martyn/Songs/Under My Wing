All your childhood dreams
All your adult schemes
All the strangest dreams and thoughts
And secrets stay with me

All the backroom dancing
Everyday just chancing
Empty glass romancing
You know, your secrets stay with me

Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing

Every long long day
Every silly thing that you say
All the weird play
Your secrets stay with me

Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing

Should you ever find yourself in trouble
I'll be the river to wash your blues away
If you find yourself on the run

Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing

All your childhood dreams
All your adult schemes
All your strangest dreams and thoughts
And secrets stay with me

Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing
