Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can, sweet Jesus

I saw her walking down the street with the night down at her feet
Walking just to get the day done
Nothing good to say, she's got no nothing good to do
Praying for a little help to come
Don't talk, don't talk to me about your crying in the rain
Inside that girl is dying again

Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can

The times get so tough, she could never get enough
Of the little things that make a woman smile
Another lovely day just goes sliding away
Tonight she's moving out in style
Don't talk, don't talk to me about crying in the rain
Inside that girl is dying again

Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can

But I knew this kind of man, she gave everything she can
Everything a little girl could lose
If she tried one more night, maybe things would work out right
Love's the kind of thing she'd never choose
Don't talk, don't talk to me about your crying in the rain
Inside that girl love is dying again

Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
