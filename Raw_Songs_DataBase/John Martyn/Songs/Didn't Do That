Some kid I met today made mention of your name
He told me that he'd seen you at the local fun and games
He said you laughed, when he asked about my health
He told me your arrived alone and split with someone else

You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You wouldn't do that, couldn't do that
Tell me that it, just didn't cross your mind
You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
Not you

So I called you on your private telephone
I was told politely that my lady was not home
You was somewhere foreign, having fun
If I leave my name and number, something might be done

You wouldn't do that, couldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that it, just didn't cross your mind
You wouldn't do that, couldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
Not you, not me, not you, not me

And so I told my friend about your goings on
He told me he was not surprised to find that you had gone
Cause he'd seen you at the airport with your ticket in your hand
Leaving me to dangle like a yo-yo in your hand

You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that it, just didn't cross your mind
You wouldn't do that, couldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
Oh, not you

Friend I met today made mention of your name
He told me that he'd seen you at the local fun and games
He said you laughed, when he asked about my health
He told me your arrived alone and split with someone else

You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that it, just didn't cross your mind
You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't, couldn't, wouldn't do it to me
Couldn't shouldn't wouldn't, couldn't, should not do it to a dog

You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You wouldn't do that, couldn't do it
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You wouldn't do that, couldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
Would not do that to me
