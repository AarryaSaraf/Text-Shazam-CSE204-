The answer may be yesterday
May be yes, today
She may say no, tomorrow
She says she might find some way
She says no today
She may say yes, tomorrow

She just changes her mind like the wind
She thinks loving me is such a sin
I don't know where to begin any more
She just changes her mind like the wind

Many times I said I'd change my way
If she would only stay, just make a stay with me
So many times I've begged her: please don't go
Ah darling, don't say no, please spend your days with me

She just changes her mind like the wind
She says sometime I'm out, when I know that I'm in
Ah I don't know where to begin any more
She just changes her mind like the wind

She says loving me is such a sin
Tell me sometime I'm out, when I know I'm in
I don't know where to begin any more
She just changes her mind like the wind

The question must be in her mind
But I can't ever find a way to talk to that girl
I know my heart is on her line
I just spend my time with my head in a spiral

Just changes her mind like the wind
She said loving me is such a sin
I don't know where to begin any more
She just changes her mind like the wind

She keeps, she keeps on changing
She keeps on changing her mind
Keep changing her mind all the time

She keeps on, she keep
She keep on she keep changing her mind, changing her mind
She keep on changing, keep on changing
Keeps changing her mind changing her mind, changing her mind all the time
I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to watch her changing her mind any more
She keep changing her mind, changing her mind
Keep on changing her mind
Changing her mind, she keep on changing her mind

She keep on she keep on changing her mind, changing her mind, changing her mind
She keep on changing her mind all the time
She keeps on changing, keep on changing, keep on changing
