Lived on a houseboat when I was young
Very young, oh so young
Every Tuesday, I would feed all the swans
In the sun, oh such fun
Then one day a man was seen
Chugging along on his river machine
It was a boat

Ah ha, hee, hee, hee
Knuckledy crunch and slippledee-slee
All I like is to cart along
And to pick a match, and to sing my song

Drank up my milk and gobbled the roll
And a bun, current bun
Counted all the kittens that lived down the hall
Every one, didn't miss one
Jumped up on the deck, looked over the side
Nearly fell in because my eyes
Were so wide, so wide

Ah ha, hee, hee, hee
Knuckledy crunch and slippledee-slee
All I like is to cart along
And to pick a match and to sing my song

Looks like uncle Harold comes to visit me
Visit me, visit me
Wish me a happy birthday, because tomorrow I'm three
I'll be three, look at me
Goes into his pocket that looks so big
Pulls out a puppet with the big blonde wig
Big Wig

Ah ha, hee, hee, hee
Knuckledy crunch and slippledee-slee
All I like is to cart along
And to pick a match and to sing my song

Ah ha, hee, hee, hee
Knuckledy crunch and slippledee-slee
All I like is to cart along
And to pick a match and to sing my song
