Here I am now
There you are beside me
After years being unhappy
Never thought I could be
Put all that bad love and evil love way behind me

Hear me right now
Hear me right now
Hear me right now
This is me you're seeing

Here I am now
Got my man beside me
Here I am now
Got his sweet love to guide me
With all that bad love and evil love put right behind me

Hear me right now
Hear me right now
Hear me right now
This is me you're seeing

Here I am now
Got my son beside me
Here I am now
Got this pure soul to guide me
With all that bad love and evil love way behind me
He ain't gonna find me

So hear me right now
Hear me right now
Hear me right now
This is me you're seeing
