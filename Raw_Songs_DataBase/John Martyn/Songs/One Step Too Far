Playing your cards right, keeping your cool
Pushing it all night, nobody's fool
Can you feel the table turning
And if you don't want me, why don't you say?
I can't live with this feeling of love slipping away
Can you feel the table turning?
Can you feel the scene begin to change

Please somebody tell me, where we are?
I believe we've come one step too far

Stepping so lightly, all over town
Johnny come lately, dangerous ground
Can you feel the table turning
Playing your cards right, keeping your cool
Pushing it all night, nobody's fool
Can you feel the tables turning?
Can you feel the scene begin to change

Please somebody tell me, where we are?
I believe we've come one step too far

Can you feel the tables turning?
Can you feel the scene begin to change
Can you feel the tables turning
Can you feel the world begin to move
Can you feel the tables turning
Can you feel the world begin to move
