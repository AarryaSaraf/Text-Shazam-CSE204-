Life has been good to me, I been good to this life
Life's been cool with me, I been cool all my life
Sometimes I cry, just like a baby try for me baby
Life was sitting right with me, I was sitting right with life
I was sitting right with my children, they were sitting right with my wife

Saddened by life from time to time
Saddened by my presence don't open 'em 'til Christmas
Sometimes I cry, just like a baby try for me baby, try for me baby
Sometimes I cry, just like a baby try for me baby, try for me baby

Off of your knees c'mon up and try me
Get off of your knees c'mon up and try
Off of your knees come and try a man like me
Stop your crying, stop that crying

Life been good to you, you been so good to this life
Life will be cool with you if you're cool with life
It could be bad for you, could be worse for me
Dear Lord don't you know you gotta try

Sometimes I cry, just like a baby
Raise my standards high
Wave my flag and raise my standard high

Try a man like me
Try a man like me
Try a man like me
Try a man like me

Raise my standards high
Raise them standards high
Raise them standards high

Wave the flag
C'mon, try a man like me
C'mon, try a man like me

Raise my standards high, try a man like me
Raise my standards high, try a man like me
