Somewhere over the rainbow
Birds fly high
There's a land that I dreamed of once
In a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And all the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Away, across the chimney tops
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, why can't I

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Away, across the chimney tops
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of once
In a lullaby
