Death don't have no mercy in this land
Death don't have no mercy in this land
It comes to your house, it won't stay long
Somebody will be gone, 'cause
Death don't have no mercy in our land

Death will go into any family in this land, I know him
Death comes into any family in this land
He's going to come in your family
He won't stay long
Look in your bed, and you'll be gone
Wake up dead

Death don't have no mercy in this land
Death don't have no mercy in this land
One night, you go to bed
The very next morning going to wake up dead
Because Father Death has got no mercy at all

Never takes a vacation in our land
Death don't take no vacation
He'll come to your house but he won't stay long
Look in the bedroom, mother will be gone
I swear, he's got no mercy in this land

He'll leave you, standing and crying in this land
Death will leave you, standing alone and crying in this land
He'll come to your house, he won't stay long
Look in the bed, someone else is gone
Death don't have mercy in our land

Death's always in a hurry, I understand
Death's always in a hurry, I can understand
He won't give you time to get ready
He won't even say, ready, steady go
You gotta go when it comes
Cos he's got no mercy in this land
Who cares
Got no mercy in this land
Death's got no mercy in this land
