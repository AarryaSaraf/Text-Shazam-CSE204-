Said she's coming in on the high tide
She's a healer, she can see
She's the sapphire
I know she left when I was a baby
But she never let me down
She's coming back to take me away
She's coming in on time

All the little children
Every mother's son
The children will be there
Every tiny detail
Every single one
The detail will be there

She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time

Said she's coming in any day now
She's a legend, she's a lover
She's the sapphire
Know she's coming in on the rip tide
She's a killer, she's a demon
She's the sapphire

All the little children
Every mother's son
The children will be there
Every tiny detail
Every single one
The detail will be there

She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
I know she's coming in on time for me
She's coming in on time

She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
