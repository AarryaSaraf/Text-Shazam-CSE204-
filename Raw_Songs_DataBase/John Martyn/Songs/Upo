Shake that trouble from your life
Love of mine, we will
We will have it as we like
Love of mine, we will
Love is pretty, baby
You know we will

There was a time, a while ago
I would have said I'd never let you go
There was a time, long gone
I would have said: oh Johnny boy
You're singing the wrong song

Stretch my reason, stretch my rhyme
Love of mine, you will
I just pull a rose and take your time
Love of mine, you will
Life is pretty, baby
You know we will

There was a time, a while ago
I would have said, I'd never let you go
There was a time, long gone
I would have said: oh Johnny boy
You're singing the wrong song, singing the wrong song, singing the wrong song

Take this winter from my heart
Love of mine, you will
Check my pride before I fall
Love of mine, you will
Life is pretty, baby

Shake that trouble from your life
Love of mine, we will
We may have it as we like
Love of mine, we will
Life is pretty, baby
You know we will
Life is pretty, baby
You know we will
Life is pretty, baby
