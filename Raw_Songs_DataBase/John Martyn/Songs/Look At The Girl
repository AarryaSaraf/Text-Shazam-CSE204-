Remember when I held her in the palm of just one hand
And felt that tiny heart against my skin
Now she's all grown up, stepping out and looking grand
I just don't believe the shape she's in

Won't you look at that girl
So fine
Won't you look at that girl
She's mine

I taught her what I knew about that wicked world outside
Tried to keep her out of dangers way
Now she tells me things I can barely understand
Feeds me not a single word to say

Won't you look at that girl
So fine
Won't you look at that girl
She's mine

Here she comes again, quite as usual
Looking fine as wine
Looking cool as rain, twice as beautiful
Oh she turned out fine

Won't you look at that girl
She's so fine
Won't you look at that girl
She once was mine

Here she comes again, cool as usual
Looking fine as wine
Just as cool as rain, but twice as beautiful
Hasn't she turned out fine

Won't you look at my girl
So fine
I know she's so fine
So fine
She's so fine, my baby girl
