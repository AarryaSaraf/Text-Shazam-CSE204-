Shut up! Close your mouth
Shut up! Close your mouth
Shut up! Close your mouth
Shut up! Close your mouth

You must never say, never say never to me
You might break my heart if you
Ever say never to me
You must never say, never say never to me
You might go break it again
If you ever say never to me

In the world today, there's trouble
Look around any corner
It's coming your way
In the world today there's trouble
Look in any direction
It's coming your way

But you must never say, never say never to me
You know you break my heart if you ever say never to me
You must never say, never say, never say never to me
You might break my heart if you ever say never to me

Every time you say I'm crazy
It makes me feel so mad
Every time you tell me, I'm going astray
Every time you say I'm lazy
Makes me feel that way
Every time you tell me, I'm slipping away

Never say, never say never to me
You'd break my heart if you
Ever say never to me
You must never say, never say never to me
You'd break your own heart if you ever say never to me

You must never say, never say never to me
You break my heart if you
Ever say never to me
You must never say, never say never to me
You'd break your own heart
If you ever say never to me

In this world today there's trouble
Look around any corner, you can feel it
You know that it's coming your way
Look out of your window
Any way, north, east, south or west
It's coming your way

You must never say, never say never to me
You break my heart if you
Ever say never to me
You must never say, never say never to me
You know I'm going apart
If you ever say 'ever to me

Ah, never say, never say, never say, never say, never say
Never say never, never say never, never say never, never say never
Don't you say that word
Shut up, close your mouth
Shut up, close your mouth
