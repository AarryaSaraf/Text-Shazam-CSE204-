Call me ugly, call me crazy, call me mad
You don't know just what I might call you
Tell me a story, tell it up
Tell it up, tell up your name
Tell it up, tell it up, tell up your name

Call me Jack Adaptor, call me Jack of Spades
Call me Jack of Diamonds, I don't care for names
They call me Jack Adjuster, they can call me Jack Alive
The call me Just, the just one, I survive

I'm Jack the Lad
I'm always Jack the Lad
I'm Jack the Lad, always Jack the Lad

It's a good day for running
It's a good day to learn just how to stay
It's a good day for moving on
It's a good day for just walking away

I'm Jack the Lad, call me Jack the Lad
They call me Jack the Lad
My name is Jack the Lad

I got skin as thick as a potato
They try to skin me and still call me Jack
I got skin as thin as a tomato
Always watch my little red back

Call for Jack the Minder
Jack the Joiner, Jack the Thief
One day, I'll jack it in
I'll go and take myself some small release
I'm Jack, I'm Jack the Lad
Call me, call me Jack the Lad

Call for Jack the Minder, call for Jack the Thief
Call for Jack the Horner, one day I'll jack it in
Play blue blood on the corner, play it blue blood
I'm Jack the Lad with a blue blood vein
I'm Jack the Lad with a blue blood vein
I'm Jack the Lad, with a blue blood vein

It wasn't just one man in the lion's den
I know for a fact that there were two
Cos I myself was there right there and then
I said to Daniel and the lion too
Don't fear, you know that Jack is here

You know I'm Jack the Lad, don't fear
Don't worry, Daniel! My name is Jack
I'm at your back, don't fear the lion's roar
Don't fear that lion, Daniel
Cause my name is Jack, I'm at your back

And I'm the only Jack the Lad

I'm Jack the Lad, they call me Jack the Lad
I'm the lion's den, everywhere I go
In the pub around the corner
They call me Jack, you know that I am Jack the Lad
What a terrible thing to be
Call me Jack the Lad
One day you will, aye, it's Jack the Lad
Come on Daniel, bring on your lion

Well they call me Jack Adjuster
Just the lies they tell about you drive me mad
They call me Jack Adapter, Jack of Spades
The lies they tell about me drive me mad

My name, my name is Jack the Lad
My name, my name, my name is Jack the Lad
My name is Jack the Lad
