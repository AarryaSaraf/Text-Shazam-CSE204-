If you go looking down in the summer
To the village at the bottom of the well
You'll find nice things and butterflies' wings
And policemen's hats as well
The girlies there won't hurt you
'Cause they're all so very nice
There's cats and dogs and bats and frogs
And little pink sugar mice

So come along and sing of summer
Sing of summer coming on
Come along and sing of summer
Summer's coming on
Summer's coming on

And won't you wear your silly trousers
And your funny feathered hat
To come home running down the road
Follow the Cheshire cat
Your friends they will all be there
And they will all be taking tea
So come on laughing down the road
Come on follow me

Come along and sing of summer
Sing of summer coming on
Come along and sing of summer
Summer's coming on
Summer's coming on

Won't you leave behind your city shoes
And lose your bowler hat
Forget about your winter woes
And wipe your eyes on the mat
Won't you leave your green wallpaper
And the clock upon the wall
And lock your doors up one by one
Come running down the hall

Come along and sing of summer
Sing of summer coming on
Come along and sing of summer
Summer's coming on
Summer's coming on

And if you go looking down in the summer
To the village at the bottom of the well
You'll find nice things and butterflies' wings
And policemen's hats as well
The ladies there won't hurt
Cos they're all so very nice
There's cats and dogs and bats and frogs
And little pink sugar mice

So come along and sing of summer
Sing of summer coming on
Come along and sing of summer
Summer's coming on
Summer's coming on
Summer is a coming on
