I'm going away to leave you
Going to leave you in disgrace
Nothing in my favour
Got the wind in my face
I'm going home
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

Can't get enough of sweet cocaine
Get enough of Mary Jane
Going back to where I came from
Going rolling back home again
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

I've been worried about my babies
Been worried about my wife
Just one place for a man to be
When he's worried about his life
I'm going home
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

Well I'm going away to leave you
Going to leave you in disgrace
Got nothing in my favour
Rain in my face
I'm going home
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
