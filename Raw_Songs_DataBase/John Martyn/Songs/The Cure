You know the cure a broken heart
You know the cure

If I come a little strong, tell me when I'm wrong
Guide me, tell me what to do
Come a little fast, please help this love to last
Pity me and take me home with you

Love is cruel, love is kind, love is never never blind
Love is honest, love is beautiful and blue
Love is always safe and sound, love will always fool around
There's not a single thing that you can do

Don't you know that love is the only cure for your broken heart
Telling you that love is the only cure for your broken heart

I've been too long on my own
Can't stand to live alone
I've got you in my blood and in my every move
And though I've got it left in, the man in me forgets
What can happen when you're falling out of love

Love is cruel, love is kind, love is never never blind
Love is honest, love is beautiful and true
Love is always safe and sound, love will always fool around
There's not a single thing for you to do

To know that love is the only cure for your broken heart
You know that love is the only cure for your broken heart

Love is cruel, love is kind, love is never never blind
Love is honest, love is beautiful and blue
Love is always safe and sound, love will always fool around
There's not a single thing for you to do

Don't you know that love is the only cure for your broken heart
Love is the only cure for your broken heart

Come a little strong, tell me when I'm wrong
Guide me, tell me what to do
Come a little fast, just help this love to last
Pity me and take me home with you

Love is cruel, love is kind, love is never never blind
Love is honest, beautiful and blue
Love is always safe and sound, love will always fool around
There's not a single thing for you to do

You know that love is the only cure for your broken heart
I'm telling you that love is the only cure for your broken heart
Love is the only cure for your broken heart

Tell it to the doctor
Love is the only cure for your broken heart
Sweet love
Love is the only cure for your broken heart
