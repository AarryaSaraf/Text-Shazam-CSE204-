Don't you look out of your window
Don't you look at me so hard
Don't try to tell me that I never tried
When I played my every card

Trying get back home, all in the easy morning
To get back home, all in the early air
Get back home, all in the early morning
To get back home

Don't you stand out on your doorstep
Don't you get out of your pram
Don't you think about my future
I like me just the way I am

Just get back home, all in the early morning
Just get back home, all in the early air
Get back home, all in the early morning
Get back home

Don't you look out of your window at me
Don't you look at me that way
Don't try to hold on to me with your eyes
Ah just keep out of my way

Just get back home
Just get back home
Get back home
Get back home

Just get back home
Ah please, get back home
Get back, get back, get back, get back, get back home
Get back home
Get back home
Ah please, get back home
Get back home, get back home
