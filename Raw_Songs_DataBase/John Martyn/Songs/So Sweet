In, In, In, In
Well it gets so strange when standing head to head
It gets so sweet side by side
Feels so strange end to end
So much sweeter side by side

So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet

C'mon take the edge off, like some kind of topiary
Take the edge off darling, just lie down with me
Oh so sweet, oh so sweet

So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet

Unchained and unrestrained
So loud so quiet, yet so proud
Unchained unrestrained
Side by side in a crowd

So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet

Well it gets so strange when standing head to head
It gets so sweet side by side
Feels so strange end to end
So much sweeter side by side

So sweet the upward surge of freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
So sweet the upward surge of freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love

So sweet the upward surge of freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
So sweet the upward surge of freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
