I've been watching you, my friend
I've been watching all the things that you try to do
Got my eyes on you, my friend
I've been checking all the moves, checking all the moves
Closer and closer; closer to the edge of your disaster
Nearer and nearer, nearer to the judgement day

I know, she's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til she makes you cry
She's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til she makes you cry
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine

I've been watching her, my friend
I've been watching her play you like a fish on a line
Watch her dangle you
Watch you dangling like a tanglefoot boy
On tanglefoot wine
Everything she tells you, everything she says
It sounds so pretty, it feels so fine
The questions that she fires, she fires just to
Check the range and shoot that line

I know, she's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til she makes you cry
She's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til she makes you cry
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine

I know, she's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til you break down and cry
She's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til she makes you cry
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
I know she's only going to love you 'till she breaks your heart
I know, she's only going to love you 'till she breaks your heart in two
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
That girl was a love of mine
