I believe in a minute for every man
When he must take notice of the clock and all its hands
If he sees the road leads straight ahead
Got to run on down, never never be afraid
And it's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people that made you cry

I know a man, six feet tall
Buckskin jacket, velvet stripes and all
From Boston town, educated well
And he keeps his mind within a padded shell
It's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people that made you cry

Behind the curtain, upon the shelf
Lives a man, living with himself
Behind his eyes, behind his smile
What's going on, nobody in the world can tell
It's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people that made you cry

It's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people that made you cry
