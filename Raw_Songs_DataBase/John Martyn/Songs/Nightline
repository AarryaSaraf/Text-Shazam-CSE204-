Watch out, watch
Watch out

They got frozen faces
They live in broken rooms
They got the strangest of places
In the dark and the gloom
Watch your mouth boy
Watch your every word
We're coming for you
Don't say you have not heard

Watch out, watch out the law's about
Watch out, cover that door
Watch out, watch out the law's about
Watch out, what's your freedom for?
Tell it to the nightline
Tell it before they lose their minds
Tell it to the nightline
Tell those people why

Your mama's crying
And your daddy's sad
They know your lying
And they know you've been had

Watch out, watch out the law's about
Watch out, cover that door
Watch out, watch out the law's about
Watch out, what's your freedom for?
Tell it on the nightline
Tell it before you lose your mind
Tell it on the nightline
Tell those people why

Is there love for sale?
Is there love for sale?

We got safety catches
But the safety kills
We got safety matches
We got gasoline spills
Talk straight, don't try to lie to me
Talk straight, look me in the eye
Talk straight, don't try to lie to me
Talk straight, tell these people why

Tell it to the nightline
Tell it before they lose their minds
Tell it to the nightline
Tell these people why

Is there love for sale?
Is there love for sale?
Is there love for sale, I'm buying
It's love for sale, I'm trying
Is there love for sale
