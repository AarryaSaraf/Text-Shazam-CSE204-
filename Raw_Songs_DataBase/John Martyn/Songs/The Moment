It could be the moment
When you tell me that you understand how I feel
It could be the moment
When you tell me that the love that you have is real

Didn't you hear me say
How I love you
Didn't I hear you say
You could love me too

Maybe the moment
That I capture in my heart, just to hide away
Maybe the moment
When you tell me that you're minding me here to stay

Here in your arms
With your heart beating slow
Here in your arms
And I can't let go

Never, never let this love go by
Never, never have my heart look away
Never, never let this love go by
Never, never grow apart of me

Maybe the moment
That reminds me of the moment when first we kissed
Maybe the moment
It's the kind of thing that I simply don't resist

Didn't I hear you say
How you love me so
Here in your arms
And I won't let go

Never, never let this love go by
Never, never have my heart hide away
Never, never let this love of ours go by
Never, never have my heart hide away

Never, never let this love go by
Never, never have my heart hide away
Never, never let this love we have go blind
Never, never have my heart glide away
