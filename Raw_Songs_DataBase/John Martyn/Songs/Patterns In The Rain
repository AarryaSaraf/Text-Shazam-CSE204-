You cannot hide, not even from yourself
Like me, you'll blame somebody else
All alone, you'll sit and watch
The patterns in the rain

You ask me why my colour's mainly blue
You'll know a change is up to you
'Till then, you'll sit and watch
The patterns in the rain

So when you wipe away a teardrop
Remember why it's there
The visions that betray you
Are hidden in each tear
If you can't believe in love
Like a pattern in the rain
The lonely game you're playing
Will haunt you once again

So don't believe you're always on your own
Your love will surely bring you home
Once again, you'll sit and laugh
At patterns in the rain

You'll feel the rain
And know it's there to wash away the pain
It's easy when your loved to start again
It's easy when you're loved

Once more you'll laugh
You cannot hide, not even from yourself
Just like me, you'll blame somebody else
All alone, you'll sit and watch
The patterns in the rain
All alone, you'll sit and watch
The pattern in the rain
