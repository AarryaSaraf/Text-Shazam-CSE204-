Big word, inspirational
Big man in such a big way
It's a small time human issue
In a cold world that throws you away

You just keep on trying
You can watch 'em crying
You can see 'em loving
Those dreams stick far above him

You never know a friend till he says goodbye
Your never know your love till it's gone
You never know a friend till he says goodbye
Your never really know your love till it's
Gone

He's a good soul, sad mind
But he knows how he wants it to be
He's as close as your bread
He's as far as your light
He's as fearless as the life left in me

He just keeps on trying
He can watch 'em crying
He just keeps on loving
Those dreams stick far above him

You never know a friend till he says goodbye
Your never know a friend till he's gone
You never know a girl till she makes you cry
You never know your love till it's gone

Small word, inspirational
Big man in a big way
Short time human issue
It's a small mind that throws you away

Just keep on loving
Just keep on trying
You just keep on crying
Those dreams stay way above him

He say
You never know a friend till he passes you by
You never know a friend till he's gone

Your never know a friend till he's
Gone...
