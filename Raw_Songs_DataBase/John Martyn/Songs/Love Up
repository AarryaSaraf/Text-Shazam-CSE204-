Your baby can't see you now, she's busy
She recommends you go and see Sister Lizzy
Step around the corner
Up against the wall
See to your needs, no trouble at all

Keep a rocking though you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking though you're rocking to your ruin
Love up, love up
Keep a rocking though you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking though you're rocking to your ruin
Love up, love up

She's got big girls, she's got small girls, she's got the street lights
She wants thin boys, they're just street toys that run all night
She's got a hot boy, he's all joy, he's alright

A little bit early or a little bit late
I can see by your eyes, you just can't wait
Stay here a minute, I'll be fast as I can
Just got to get rid of this crazy man

Keep a rocking till you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking till you're rocking to your ruin
Love up, love up
Oh, keep a rocking till you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking till you're rocking to your ruin
Love up, love up

I like big girls, I like small girls, I love the street lights
I hate thin boys, they're just street toys, they stay all night
Well I'm all boy, and I'm all joy and I'm alright

Every week on Sunday, you'll find me waiting
Hanging around the door and just a he hesitating
I know I'm not welcome, I can't go in
My daddy, he's a minister, he says it's a sin

Keep a rocking till you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking, keep a rocking till your ruin
Love up, love up
Keep a rocking till you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking though you're rocking to your ruin
Love up, love up

I like big girls, small girls, street lights
Thin boys, street toys, they get all night
Love up, love up
I got the, got the big girls, small girls
Thin boys, they're just street toys to me
Love up, love up

All boy, hot joy, all right, all night
Love up, love up
Keep a rocking till you don't know what you're doing
Keep on rocking, it's got to be your ruin
Love up, love up
Keep a rocking
Keep a rocking
Love up, love up
