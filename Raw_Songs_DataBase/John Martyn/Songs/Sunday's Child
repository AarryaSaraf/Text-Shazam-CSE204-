Saturday night come creeping
Saturday night come creeping cold
Saturday night come laughing and dancing
Sunday leaves you cold

Saturday night come crying
Saturday night come weeping and sore
Saturday night finds you looking for friends
That you don't want to see no more

Saturday night come crazy
Saturday night come swinging and wild
Saturday night come sharp as my suit
I want to be Sunday's child

Saturday night come creeping
Saturday night come creeping and cold
Saturday night come laughing and dancing
Sunday leaves you old
Leaves you old
