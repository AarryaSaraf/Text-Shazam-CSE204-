You don't need, you don't need anybody
Nobody but me
I don't need, I don't need anybody
Nobody but you
You don't need to say you love me
You don't need to say that much
You don't need to say you love me
Cos I can tell by your tender touch

You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life
You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life

I don't need your conversation
I don't need your soul to sympathize
I can feel the sweetest sensations
Falling down just behind your eyes

You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life
You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life

Some days I walk in my own shadow
I do wish I had a walk to water life
Never feel my spirit freezing down that low
You can come drive away my darkness
You can make my life shine

You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life
You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life

You don't need to say you love me
You don't need to say that much
You never need to say you love me
I can tell by that tender touch

You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life
I want you just to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life

You don't need, you don't need anybody
Nobody but me
I don't need, I don't need anybody
Nobody but you
