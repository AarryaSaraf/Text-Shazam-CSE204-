Went to see the sun go down on Primrose Hill
The Sunday evening sun go down on Primrose Hill
Never could be anything else
Never should be anything else
Cos I like that kind of life
I like that kind of life

Never thinking too far ahead
Hanging high, I fall to bed
That's the only kind of life I've led
Just the pictures in your room
Smell the rose's sweet perfume
While you're around, you've got to hear this tune
And all those groovy guys
And all those groovy guys

We went to see the sun go down on Primrose Hill
The Sunday evening sun go down on Primrose Hill
Never could be anything else
Never should be anything else
Cos I like that kind of life
I like that kind of life
Do you like that kind of life?
Do you like that kind of life?
Do you like that kind of life?
