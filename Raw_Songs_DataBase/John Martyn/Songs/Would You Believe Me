Would you believe me if I told you
For four long years you kept the wolf from my door
For four long years you kept my feet upon the floor
And now you're crying
Would you believe me if I told you
That my mind had changed me
That I rearranged me
And now you're crying

And it's a long, long way
It's such a long, long way
So many turnings, so many turnings

Would you believe me if I told you
That I'm sorry for the logic in the lies
That I've found by complete surprise
The truth
Would you believe me if I told you
That I didn't want to lose you
That's why I had to bruise you
So sad

And it's a long, long way
It's such a long, long way
So many turnings, so many turnings

Would you believe me if I told you
When I said that I could marry you
I surely didn't mean to carry you
To here
Would you believe me if I told you
That at twenty years young and all
You simply have got no control
Of the time

And it's a long, long way
Such a long, long way
So many turnings, so many turnings

Would you believe me if I told you
For four long years you kept the wolf from my door
For four long years you kept my feet upon the floor
And now you're crying
