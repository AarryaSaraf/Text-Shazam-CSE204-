Get so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and this arrow here
I'm going to give my heart away
And leave it to the other boys out there to play
I've been tempted too long
Going

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason, if you can

From this time unchained
We are looking at a different picture
Through a different frame of mind
A thousand flowers may bloom
Wouldn't it be time to move over
Move over, give me some room

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man
Give me a reason to love you
Please, one reason if you can

Don't you start looking like some woman
Take a little look from the outside, if you can
Move over me now, try a little tenderness
A little shabby dress, I wouldn't care
Only cry for you, cry for you
Might die for you too

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man
Give me a reason to love you
Oh please, give me reason if you can

Since the beginning of forever
Forever and ever and ever and ever
It's time to move over now
I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and this arrow
I'm going to give my heart away
And going to leave it to the other boys to play
I've been tempted too long, too long
I've been tempted every day
I've been tempted too long

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man
Give me a reason to love you, to love you
Give me a reason, if you can
Reason if you can
