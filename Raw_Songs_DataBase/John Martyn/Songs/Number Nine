Number nine
I wish, I wish I could remember
I wish that I may remember your name
Oh the sweetening, all the motels
Cheap nights, sweet rites
Lovely movement

The moon on the river is telling the truth
That moon, that river

I wish I could remember, I could remember
I wish I could remember your name
I wish I could remember

Oh Lord, the power of the word
One name, the power of the word
Schoolgirl days, and the school boy ways

Every day I played with the girl next door
Every other day she'd come and play with me
You can play in my apple tree
You can squeeze my lemon
You can play in my apple tree
You can come in my yard anytime

I wish I could remember
I wish I could remember
I wish I could remember
I wish I could remember your name

All the time and paper flying by
All those years, the postage stamps
Just to tell you I'm alive

I wish I could remember, I wish I could remember your name
I wish I could remember, you know I do
