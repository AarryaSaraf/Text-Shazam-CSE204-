What happened to the fisherman's dream
When they rowed that last boat down
What happened to the fisherman's dream
When he cast his last net around

What happened to the fisherman's love
When they drove him over the hill
What happened to the fisherman's dream
When they laid him in the ground

Tell me, did it fade away?
Did it fade on down to the ocean
Did it fade away
Did it fade on down to the sea

What happened to the fisherman's love
Was it nowhere to be found
What happened to the love of the fisherman
When they drove that last nail down

Tell me, did it fade away?
Did it fade on down to the ocean
Did it fade away
Did it fade on down to the sea
The ocean and the sea

Tell me, did it fade away?
Did it fade on down to the ocean
Did it fade away
Did it fade on down to the sea
