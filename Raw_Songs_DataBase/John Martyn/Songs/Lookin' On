What kind of love is this
Concealed behind your kiss
What kind of love would try
Behind a silent cry
To come stealing in, with an innocent grin
To leave you staring
At the empty ceiling, feeling nothing
Lookin' on
I'm just lookin' on

My cynic friends maintain
A low profile with a high disdain
I think I'll try once more to make friends
With the wolves that live at my door
And come stealing in, with their innocent grin
And leave me staring
At the empty ceiling
Feeling absolutely nothing
Lookin' on
Leave you
Lookin' on, lookin' on
Leave you
Lookin' on

What kind of mood will change
Or ease this subtle flame
What warm and blissful rain
Might doubt your trust again
For that beautiful thing
That once made my poor heart sing
Beautiful thing
It's never going to leave me
Believe me now

Just lookin', just lookin'
Just lookin', just lookin', just lookin' on
Lookin' on, lookin' on, lookin' on
Lookin' on, lookin' on, lookin' on

What kind of mind will find
Such a strange and empty time
Draw the finest line
Between loving and being too cruel to be kind
To let love come stealing in
With an innocent grin
Leave you staring at the empty ceiling
Feeling nothing
Just lookin' on, lookin' on, lookin' on
Just lookin'; lookin', lookin'

What kind of love is this
Concealed behind your kiss
What kind of love would try
Behind the silent cry
To come stealing in, with an innocent grin
To leave you staring
At the empty ceiling, feeling nothing
Just look: just lookin' on
I'm just lookin'
Just lookin' on

Lookin' on
