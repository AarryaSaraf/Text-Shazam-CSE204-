And hello train, it's April fool today
And when you get here, I know you're going to stay
Your letter said you'd travel by the 14:30 line
You'll be on the platform running
Oops, don't you look fine

And hello train, it's April fool today
And won't it be nice to feel you smile
And won't it be nice to feel you loving me
And hello train, it's April fool today

And here comes the gardener, funny little man
He gives me a letter and puts it in my hand
Fumbling with the envelope, and trying to keep cool
Open up the letter, my my, it's April fool

And hello train, it's April fool today
It would have been nice to feel you smile
It would have been nice to feel you loving me
And hello train, it's April fool today

Unwanting to cry, I sigh, I slide away
And would you believe, the man calls out to stay
Look over my shoulder, hello he isn't there
Just a heap of railway clothes and whoops, my girlie's hair

And hello girl, it's April fool today
And isn't it nice to feel you smile
And isn't it nice to feel you loving me
And hello train, it's April fool today
