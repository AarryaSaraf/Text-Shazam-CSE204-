My young love said to me
My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind

And she laid her hand on me
And this she did say
It will not be long, love
Till our wedding day

She stepped away from me
And she went through the fair
And fondly I watched her
Move here and move there

And then she went homeward
With one star awake
As the swan in the evening
Moves over the lake

Last night she came to me
My true love came in
And softly she came
That her feet made no din

And she laid her hand on me
And this she did say
It will not be long, love
Till our wedding day
