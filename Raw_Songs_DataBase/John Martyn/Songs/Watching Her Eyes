Women know protraction
As they cut it into sections
She's just splitting
All throughout the crazy action
Counting every fraction every bird that flies

Keeps watching her eyes
He's just watching her eyes
He keeps watching her eyes
Can't stop watching her eyes

But his time is running short
Making sure of what he's got
He's not moving much
Seems so hard in this strange weather
To try to live without a lover
Or a loving touch

He keeps watching her eyes
He keeps watching her eyes
He keeps watching her eyes
He keeps watching her eyes

He feels the movement
He feels the passion
Takes no relaxation
Yields only tension
They take their pleasure
They give no concession
Give no indication
You get no information

She telephones a friend
Who takes her to the railway where the water's fall
Can't think of any reason
It's just the changing of the season
So he watches walls

No more watching her eyes
No more watching her eyes
No more watching her eyes
No more watching those eyes

He feels the movement, feels the passion, feels the relaxation
No more watching her eyes
He takes the pleasure, no concession, indication, information
No more watching her eyes
No more
No more watching her eyes
He's taking the lies away
Taking the lies away
