The army and the navy
They never will agree
Til all the men and all the boys
Are gone from our country

Don't you go
Don't you go my son
Don't you go
Don't you go my son

The proud and the powerful
In whose hands we lie
Never will be pleasured
Til all our women cry

Don't you go
Don't you go
Ah, don't you go
Don't you go my son

The mastery, the misery
Called the art of war
Must never try and foil world peace
As it has done before

Don't you go
Don't you go my son
Don't you go
Don't you go my son

The army and the navy
They never will agree
'Til all the men and all the boys
Are gone from this country

Oh, don't you go
Don't you go my son
Don't you go
Don't you go

Don't you go
Don't you go
Don't you go
Don't you go my son
