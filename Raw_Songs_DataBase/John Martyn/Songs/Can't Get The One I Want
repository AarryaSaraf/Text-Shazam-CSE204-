I'm feeling down
My senses are bound
Cos I can't get the one I want to
Can't get the one I want to

Don't ask me the time
My watch doesn't wind
I neglected my taste
And I'm drinking cheap wine
Cos I can't get the one I want to love

So I'm just biding my time
Drunk is drunk
The wine is just fine

There's so many people
Trying to get to
Get to the one they want to
Get to the one they want to
Get to the one they want to love

So I'm just biding my time
Till I see you again
The wine will do fine
I can't get the one I want to
I can't get the one I want to, oh
I can't get the one I want to love
Love...
