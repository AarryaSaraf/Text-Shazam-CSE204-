No difference here
I feel no difference here inside
No difference here
Feel no difference here inside

If by some chance you say goodbye to me
Rest assured, you'll always be loved
Better loved you never could be
And if, by some chance, I say goodbye to you
Call my bluff, I'm never that tough
That's a thing I never could do

One love in my life is enough for me
One love in this heart of mine
One love in my life is enough for me
One love in this life of mine

Feel no difference here
Feel no difference here inside
No difference here

But if some tiny crack should ever start to show
Never you fear, I will always be here
First man to let you know
If some tiny difference should rear it's head and shine
Don't you care, I'll be there
First man to call you mine

One love in my life is enough for me
One love in this heart of mine
One love in my life is enough for me
One love in this life of mine

One love in my life is enough for me
One love in this life of mine
One love in my life is enough for me
One love of my life
One love
One love of my live
One love
