Feel so bad, like a ball game on a rainy day
I'm telling you, I feel so bad, just like a ball game on a rainy day
Since I lost my baby
I had to shake my head
Shake my head and walk away

Sometimes I want to stay here
Then again I think, I believe I want to leave
Believe I might want to leave
Sometimes I want to stay here
Tomorrow I might leave
But maybe I want to stay
I just can't make my mind up
Shake my head, then want to walk way

I'm trying to tell you people
Tell you just how I feel
Yes I keep trying to tell all you people
Exactly how I feel
Feel so bad inside, yes I do
My baby gave me dirty deal

I feel so bad, worse than a ball game on a rainy day
Yes I do, I feel so bad
I feel worse than a ball game on a rainy, rainy day
Since the day I lost my darling
I swear, I shake my head, I walk away

Sometimes I want to stay here, but
Then again I think I want to leave
Sometimes I want to stay here, but
Then again I want to leave, I just can't make my mind up
I'm telling you: I got my clothes, they're packed and ready
I waiting for that one, little ready steady
I gotta go, I'm feeling lonely
Oh I've been coming down so bad I'm lonely now, it's worse
I don't care if it rains in your ball game
May it rain in the ball game
Don't care if it rains in the ball game
It always rains in the ball game
