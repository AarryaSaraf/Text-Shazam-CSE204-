Out of the west come a glorious fool
He tried to impress me with curious cool
He lied from the start
But I knew just what he was trying

He lied to his mother
And lied to the rest
He lied to his brother
Who loved him the best
He lied to himself
I believe that he lied to my children

They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
Half the lies he tells you are not true
You know that half the lies he tells you are not true

You may come to the white house
You may walk through the white door
And may come to the white building
Sleep on the white house floor

You've come to the wrong people
Come to the wrong floor, yeah
You knocked on the wrong window
Come to the wrong door, he

Watching a person
Watching a leaf
Watching a Christian
Watching a thief
You can watch what you want, when you will
But you can't watch a liar

Even lied to your children

They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true at all
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true

Out of the west came this curious fool
Intent to impress me with his cool
He lied from the start
But I knew just what he was trying

Well he lied to his mother
He lied to the rest
He lied to the people
Who loved him the best
I believe he lied to his children

They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
Half the lies he tells you are not true
Half the lies he tells you are not true

You may come to the white house
You may come to the white door
You walked through the white building
You might sleep on the white house floor

You may come to the wrong building
The wrong door, yeah
You come to see the wrong people
Come to the wrong partner

They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
Half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true

Believe me that, half the lies he tells you are not true
Believe me that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say half the lies he tells you are not true
Half the lies he tells you are not true
