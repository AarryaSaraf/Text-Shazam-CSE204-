Rain clouds are forming
Darken my room
Winter you're here so soon

And you've tried to see him
Tried in despair
He's got his mind elsewhere

Know how we love him
And oh how you care
Love is so hard to bare

Just one of those days
Another one of those days
Just one of those days
Another one of those days

I see you coming and now I'm alive
I see you coming and now I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive

And you don't even write
And you don't even call
Won't take the chance to fall

And you've tried to see him
Tried in despair
He's got his mind elsewhere

Rain clouds are forming
See them darken my room
Winter you're here so soon

Just one of those days
Another one of those days
Just one of those days
Another one of those days

I see you coming and now I'm alive
I see you coming and now I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive
