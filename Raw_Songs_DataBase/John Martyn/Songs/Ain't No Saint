Live, live, live, live
Don't live alone
Love, love
Love, love, love love, love
You can not do it alone

Let's get it straight, it's love not hate
Don't fuss and fight, let's get it together
Get it laid down on solid ground
Don't fuss and fight, let's get it together

Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh
Do not laugh alone
Love, love, love, love
You cannot do it alone

Love finds a way, just let it stay
From day to day, just get it together
Get it laid down from all around
Its love not hate, just get it together

Live, live, live, live
Don't live alone
Love, love, love, love
You can not do it alone

Love finds a way, just let it stay
From day to day, just let it flow, just let it grow
It will get you together
Let's get it straight: it's love not hate
Don't fuss and fight, let's get it right, let's get it together

Love finds a way, just let is stay
Love, love, love, love, love...
