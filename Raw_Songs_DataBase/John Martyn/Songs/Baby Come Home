Woman come home
Please, please, woman come home

Got something for you
Gonna make you jump and shout
I got something for you here
Tell you what it's all about

Woman get home
Come on woman, get home to me
Woman get home, woman get home
Woman get home with me right now

Get you a ticket
The bus, the train, the airplane, the boat
Gotta row across the water
Just woman get home

Ah woman get home to me
Missing you so, child
I'm missing you so
Miss you so when you got away
Ah woman come home

Woman get back to me
Bring your skinny little ass back home
Bring your skinny little ass back home
Bring your skinny little ass back here to me
Bring your ass back home, I say

Woman come home
Ah please, I'm just missing you so
I can't go without you
I can't go on

Woman come home to me right now, don't think about it
Woman come home to me right now and don't think about it

Get you to take my old dog
Sat it down to Wilson Pickett
Just get your ass home
Skinny little ass, right
Bring it on  and me

Leap up and ski, we'll try
While you bring your skinny ass home
Come on get here today, before yesterday
I don't care, as long as it's so
Come on, I'll buy your ticket
Said it with Wilson Pickett

I don't care as long as you get here
I don't care as long as you get here
I don't care as long as you get here
I don't care, long as you get here
I don't care, long as you get here
I don't care

Woman come home
Please, please, woman come home
Get your ass home
Please, please, knock before

Come on, the door is open
Get your ass here
The day before yesterday
That's when I want to see you
It's the day before yesterday
