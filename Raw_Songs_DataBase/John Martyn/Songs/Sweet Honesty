Talk of making love
Take your time to bluff your way to stay
Let me use your eyes
Please don't muse with words that cut me down to size
With your lovely mind never taking time to treat a woman kind

You remain to me a vision of sweet honesty
Sweet honesty, sweet honesty, sweet honesty

Do I need to say
That I'm wiser with surprise for? power? in your eyes?
Morning sets the scene
The more you stay, the more you go for me, it seems
With your lovely mind never taking time to treat a woman kind
