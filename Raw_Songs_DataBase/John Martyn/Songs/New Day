Circles around the town
Give us all some time to think
Please let us all come down

Not what you say and not what you hear
Not who you love and not who you fear
What you feel is real
What you feel is real

Just behind the yawning morning
Look and there's a new day dawning
Just behind your shying crying
Look and there's a new year lying

Not what you say and not what you hear
Not who you love and not who you fear
What you feel is real
What you feel is real

Save your days and save your time
You save yours and I'll save mine
Drink your water, drink your wine
You drink yours and I'll drink mine

Not what you say and not what you fear
Not who you love and not who you hear
What you feel is real
What you feel is real
