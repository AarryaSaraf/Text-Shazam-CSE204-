Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
Oh darling, won't you hold me tight?
And never let me go

And dry those eyes
No tears, no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might
And never let me go

A million times, or more
We said we'd never part
But lately, I find
I'm a stranger in your heart

Ah, give me the right
In summer or in spring time
To tell the world that you were mine
And never let me go

Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
Oh darling, please hold me tight
And never let me go

And never let me go
And never let me go
