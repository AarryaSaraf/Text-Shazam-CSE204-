I never met anyone like you before
It seemed every love affair would leave me crying
I thought I'd never find what I was looking for
Searching for so long, I got tired of trying
I never could tell anyone how I feel
I never could make it quite clear
I never could hold on to anyone's heart
Life's everything I held dear

I travelled in circles, drunk every day
Lending myself but at slander and libel
I didn't need your love so I threw it away
I think about nothing but my own survival
I lost count of the money he held in his hands
More money just to die in more pain
How you could love me, I don't understand
You pulled me in and out of that pouring rain

Look at me now, I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you
I can live on love sweet love
Look at me now, I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you girl
I can live on love sweet love
Sweet love

I never knew anyone like you before
It seemed every love affair would leave me crying
I thought I'd never find what I was looking for
Searching for so long, I got tired of trying
I never could tell anyone how I feel
I never could make it quite clear
I never did hold on to anyone's heart
Life's everything I held dear

Look at me now, I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you
I can live on love, sweet love
Take a look, take a good look, darling
I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you girl
I can live on love, sweet love

Take a look, take a good look, come on and take a look
I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you girl
I can live on love, sweet love

Take a look, take a good look, come on and take a look
I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you girl
I can live on love, sweet love
