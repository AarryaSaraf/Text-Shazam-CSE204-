Although I've been away so many lonely nights
You know I'm back today
I'm back to stay in your arms
And though I've been around and lived the life I said I loved
You know without you
Honey, all I do is worth nothing
And girlie, don't cry for me

Although there might be other people in my life
Honey, on my mind
You will always find there's only you
And though you say you'll journey to some foreign land
I'll remember you
Yes, and I'll be true to your memory
And girlie, don't cry for me

And when, at last, you do come wandering home to me
I might look at you
But it will be through the weeks between
And when I hold you, it might not be you I have
In the passing days
We might both have changed to something new
And girlie, don't cry for me

And though I've been away so many lonely nights
You know I'm back today
I'm back to stay in your arms
And though I've been around and lived the life I said I loved
You know without you
Honey, all I do is worth nothing
And girlie, don't cry for me
