Excuse me mister, do you have the time?
Or are you so important that it stands still for you
Excuse me mister, lend me your ear
Are you not only blind but are you scared to hear?

Excuse me mister, is that oil in the sea
Pollution in the air, mister what could that be
Excuse me mister, I'm a mister too
There's misters like you, giving me a bad name

I'm taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you that put the rest of us to shame
I'm taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, that give me a bad name
Giving me a bad name... sweet love

Excuse me mister, can't you see the children dying
You say that you can help them; you're not even trying
Excuse me mister, take a look around
Mister just look up, and you will see what's coming down

Oh, taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, that give me a bad name
Yes I'm taking the mister right out of your name
Misters like you that put the rest of us to shame
I'm taking the mister out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, giving misters like me, a bad name
You're giving me, a bad name

Mister, mister, when you're rattling on heaven's gate
Let me tell you mister, then it's going to be too late
Oh mister, mister, when you get there
They don't care how much you saved
They want to know how much you gave away

Excuse me mister, I'm a mister too
You're giving me a bad name
A mister like you, you fool

Taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, that give me a bad name
Come on, taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, give me a bad name
Taking the mister right out of your name
Cos it's misters like you, that keep giving me a bad name

Excuse me mister
Please excuse me mister
Excuse me mister, do you have the time
Or are you so important that it stands still for you
Excuse me mister lend me your ear
