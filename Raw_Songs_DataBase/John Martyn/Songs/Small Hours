Going to get on up and fly away
Go on out for another way
And a new day's dawn
Going to carry on

Keep on loving while your love is strong
Keep on loving 'til your love is gone away

Well you're very lovely, going to take you home
They say you'll be my ruin
Cos I love you so
I just love you so

Keep on loving 'til your love is gone
Keep on loving while your love is strong
All the way
