No eavesdropping darling, I overheard
Put me down, in action and word
Taking me for granted, I finally knew
I called you last night, I could not get through

Just hung up, hung up on you
Just hung up, hung up on you
I'm hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you

I run a check on your behaviour, got to check the bar
Trying to forget what people tell me you are
All I want to remember, is the diamonds in your eyes
The same precious memories I've come to despise

I'm just hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
Mmm, hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you

Hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you

Nothing lasts forever, I know, nothing at all
I know you won't answer me when I start calling
That busy line is just a weapon you use
Just an empty sign in the mind of the man you want to lose

I'm just hung up, hung up on you
Just hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you

Hung up, hung up on you
Just hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
