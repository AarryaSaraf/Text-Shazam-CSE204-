The sun was red and the sky was blue
And I went rowing on the road to ruin
How do you make a day like that?
How do you make it real?

The geese were making an evening sound
And I went raving down the crazy paving
How do you make a day like that?
How do you make it real?

And every day is just a joy to hold
The needle is new and the patterns are old
How do you make a game like that?
How do you make it real?

The sun was red and the sky was blue
And I went rowing on the road to ruin
How do you make a day like that?
How do you make it feel?
