Waking up and finding she's not there
Sleepy looking around to find out where I am
Get out of bed, go tripping down the stairs
And before you eat your breakfast, say your prayers
And the early morning pigeons fly around
Getting startled on my lonely footed sound
And yesterday's newspaper is flying too
Whirling down the wind that I once knew

And the red and yellow birds come drifting by
Reflecting in themselves the windy sky
And you walk along beside them in a dream
And you wonder where they're going and where they've been
And the river's smiling bravely through the rain
Thinks everything is really just the same
And the rain comes down, and wets the curly hair
Of the children playing where your memories were
