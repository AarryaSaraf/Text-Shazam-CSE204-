Hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape

She's just a hiss on the tape
Her head's so dirty
She's a girl on the make
She could be fifteen or thirty
Got to give her a break
Her sensitivities glisten
She's had all she can take
Still the tape keeps hissing

You can ask her the question
Ah she'll tell you the lie
They're too many to mention
Too many wondering why

She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape

She's a ball in the air
Emotional token
Just one of a pair
Til her bond gets broken
There's a point in the line
Her mind starts doubting
Just a dot on the card
All done bar the shouting

Ask her the question
She'll keep telling the lie
They're too many to mention
Too many wondering why

She's just a hiss on the tape
She's a hiss on the tape
She's a hiss on the tape
She's a hiss on the tape

Hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape
Oh she's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss

There's a crack in her mind
There's a fault in her logic
She's fallen behind
She knows she just can't dodge it
Like the snap of the trap
She closes up so tightly
She cut out all the rap
She just plays twice nightly

Ask her the question
She'll keep telling the lie
They're too many to mention
Too many wondering why

Oh She's going out with a friend
She's in a strange good humour
She got no time to spend
She's just the start of the rumour
Just a silky suggestion
A sliver of thigh
It's out of the question
Give the slightest of sighs

She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a girl on the make
She's just a hiss on the tape

She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss
She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss
