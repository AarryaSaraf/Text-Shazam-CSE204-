Hey Mama T, hey Mama T-razor stepping down the street
Mama sing T-razor Mama T, Mama T, look what you done to this child
Oh we're living so quiet on the street out there
I didn't have a notion, not one bull's notion or a care
I went swinging oh from gutter to gutter, you could almost smell me

Mama T come looking for me, Mama T-razor just as sharp as a knife
Mama T-razor come looking for me, Mama T you bring me roses every day
My Mama T bring me roses every day, Mama T bring me roses every day
My Mama T bring me roses every day

Lying down, keeping quiet, don't know what, start a riot
Well I ain't got my gloves on
I don't care about the town square
I don't care about New Delhi, otherwise
Only Mama T-razor saved me, Mama T-razor come and help me up

Mama T, Mama T, my Mama T, my Mama T little a razor come up and saved me
Gutter to gutter, ghetto to ghetto, get to hell
Who knows how they smell?
Who know who the lepers are, who the unclean are
Tell me who the lepers are, who the unclean are

Mama T-razor gonna tell you now, Mama T-razor stepping up and out
Mama T-Razor, sharp as you like
Mama T-razor sharper than any marlinspike
The marlin, the marlin, the marlin, the marlin
Here come that swordfish, gonna cut you down like a little sharp razor

Razor sharp like Mama T, going to cut you
Mama T, get it together
Mama T, get it together
Mama T, spread my bed with roses every day
Spread my bed with roses every day
Every flower in the rainbow, they all belong to me
They came from Mama T

Mother Theresa stepping up on me
Mother T, all them roses
Cover me with roses every day
She cover me with them roses and them flowers

Red?
Indigo?
Must you go?
Here come, here come the Saffron
Here come that gofor, run
Here come the Twyler
You can throw me roses every day
Like Mama T
