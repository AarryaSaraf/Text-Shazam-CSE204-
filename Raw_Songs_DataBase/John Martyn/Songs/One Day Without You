One day without you
And I feel just like I'm somebody else
One day without you
And there's a fear there might be somebody else

You know that I'd like to keep you
Keep you to myself, and by my side
You know I'd like to keep you
Just like I know it's wrong to try
Just like my babies were born to cry
Every bird that sings is born to fly

One day without you
And I feel just like some lost ship at sea
One day without you
And every friend I meet seems strange to me

You know that I'd like to keep you
Keep you to myself, by my side
You know that I like to keep you
Just like I know it's wrong to try
Just like my babies were born to cry
Every bird that sings is born to fly

One day without you
I feel a hole just where my heart should be
One day without you
And I feel just how sad my life could be

You know I'd like to keep you
Keep you to myself, keep you by my side
You know I like to keep you
Just like I know it's wrong to try
Just like my babies were born to cry
Every bird that sings deserves to fly...
