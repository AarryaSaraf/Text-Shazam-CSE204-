Some of us live like princes
Some of us live like queens
Most of us live just like me
And we don't know what it means
To take our place in one world
To make our peace in one world
To make our way in one world
To have our say in one world

If you ain't got two words to say
Then I can't talk to you
No use crying, there's been no crime
I say it's just the way the wind blows
Just the name of the game
The way of the world
The way of the world
Just the way of the world
Just the way of the world

Cold and lonely, cold and lonely
Cold and lonely world, for some
Cold and lonely, cold and lonely
Cold and lonely
Just a cold and lonely world for some

There's one world, like it or not
There's one world, believe it or not
There's one world
There's one world, leave it or not
One world, like it or not
There's one world

Some of us live like princes
Some of us live like queens
Most of us live just like me
And we don't know what it means
To take our place in one world
To take our place in one world
To make our love in one world
Make our way in one world
One world, one world
