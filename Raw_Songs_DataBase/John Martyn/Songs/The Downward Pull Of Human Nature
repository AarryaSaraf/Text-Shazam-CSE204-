Consider this, consider that, consider this
You've got to consider this and that
Consider this, consider this
Consider this, consider this

Did you ever look sideways at your best friend's wife?
Ever consider that sweet married life
Your mind run riot, you know who you are
Ever get the feeling that you move too far

The downward pull of human nature
Coming to take you home
And just the downward pull of human nature
Coming to take you by a storm

Ever get so drunk that you fell without falling?
Did you feel that six foot destiny just calling you home
Do you ever hear that siren roar in the night
Find that you were wrong, try to believe that you were right

It's the downward pull of human nature
It's coming to try you on
It's just the downward pull of human nature
Coming trying to take your soul by a storm
Here it comes

Did you ever go crazy, and try to hurt the one you love?
Very next day, you had to beg for forgiveness from the power
You know your pride will always be your fall
You know one day, your will will wither like a flower in the dawn

Downward pull of human nature
It's coming to try you on
It's just that downward pull of human nature
It's coming trying to take your heart by the storm

Oh yesterday, looking sideways at your best friend's wife
I know you never considered the joys of that sweet married life
I saw your mind run riot, remember who you are
I know the feeling when you've gone a step too far

It's just the downward pull of human nature
It's coming every day to take you on
It's just that downward pull of human nature
Coming to take you by a storm

Just that downward pull of human nature
Coming to try it on
The downward pull of human nature
Just trying to take you by a storm

Just the downward pull
Just the downward pull
Downward pull of human nature
Coming to try you on
