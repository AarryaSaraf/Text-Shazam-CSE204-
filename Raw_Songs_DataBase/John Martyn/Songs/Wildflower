Take all your faith and put it in me
Take all your sweet love and give it to me
Everyone of your passions, all the lessons so hard
Take everyone of your little missions put your hand on your heart and tell me
I've been spitting on the sweetest word that was ever written

All of my reason all my logic, seems so spent
Wait here 'til the storm is over, darling please don't go
Wait here 'til the rain stops falling on me, please don't go

Everywhere everyday the all seeing eye gives me visions of you
To holding me heart and keeping me hand
All of them glances all the chances I took, I gave 'em all to you
I gave 'em all to you
My resolve is week, sometimes staggering from street to street

But I still love wildflowers, and I still love my rose
Give me your faith all your love all you passion too

Teach me the lessons you leaned so hard teach me through and through
Help this helpless heart of mine
Wait here 'til the storm is over, oh don't go
Wait here 'til the rain stops falling on me, please don't go

Take all your faith and put it in me
Take all your sweet love and give it to me
Everyone of your passions, all the lessons so hard
Everyone of your missions, put your hand on your heart
I believe I been smitten by the sweetest word ever written

All of my reason all my logic, seems so spent
Wait here 'til the storm is over, darling please don't go
Wait here 'til the rain stops falling on me, please don't go

Wait here 'til the storm is over, darling please don't go
Wait here 'til the rain stops falling on me, oh don't leave me so

Don't you leave me here don't you leave me, oh no
You got to wait 'til the rain stops falling, falling on me
You got to wait 'til the storm is over come on, stay by me
Darling, please don't go
