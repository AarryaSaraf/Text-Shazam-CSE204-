When I was little, they took me to school
Tried to teach me just how to learn
Numbed you, tell you, everything I done on me
I swear, I had to earn it
Step it up, step it up
Step it up, step it up

One way for you, one way for me
Only one way forward that I can see
That's step it up, step it up for me
Step it up for her, step it up step for me

Never lie down, don't take it
You've got some kind of fate, they'll never shake you
All you've got to do is
Step it up, step it up
Step it up step, step it up

One way for you, one way for me
Only one way forward this boy can see
Come on
Step it up step, step it up step
Step it up step, step it up

Absolute concentration
There's nothing wrong with consideration
Just love, all you do is
Step it up step, step it up

One day I saw my friend around a corner, round the bend
I said, hey darling, what's the matter with you
She said
Step it up

Oh darling sometimes, I feel I could never ever step it up
And I said dear friend walk in love, think about nothing but love
Just come on
Step it up step, step it up step
Step it up step, step it up step

One way for you, one way for me
There's only one way forward I can see
Step it up step step it up step
Step it up step, step it up
Step it up step, step it up
Step it any time you like
Step round the corner, call for me
