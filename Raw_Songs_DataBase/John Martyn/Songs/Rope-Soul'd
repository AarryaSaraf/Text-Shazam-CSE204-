Rope soul'd, and walking away
Tie it tight and bind your feet
Rope soul'd, and walking away
Rope soul'd, and
Tie it tight and bind your feet
Get it right and make it feel

Sand in your shoe

Can suck up cold can suck up snow for any day
Watch them travel, see how they run
Born walking, slow talking
Tie it tight and bind your feet
Get it right and make it
Ball walking, walking away
Rope soul'd and lock it

Slipping and slithering, and slipping away
Strip it down and glisten, glisten
And Slipping, slipping

Rope soul'd, walking away
Rope soul'd, walking away
Rope soul'd, walking away
