I feel that I have known you for a lifetime now
Though these eyes of mine have never touched your face
The distance between us seems so great sometimes
How I need your love to fill this empty space

I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, I keep waiting for some kind of sign
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, close watch on this heart of mine

Send me one line tell me who you are
Send me one line tell me just what might have been
Send me one line tell me who you are
Send me one line

I know we never meet, I know you understand
Every shade of love and every dream I have to hide
With every day that slips away, I read your name again
And I try to push away the pain inside

I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, I keep waiting for some kind of sign
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, close watch on this heart of mine

Send me one line tell me who you are
Send me one line tell me just what might have been
Send me one line to tell me who you are
Send me one line

I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, I keep waiting for some kind of sign
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, a close watch on this heart of mine

Send me one line tell me who you are
Send me one line tell me just what might have been
Send me one line tell me who you are
Send me one line
