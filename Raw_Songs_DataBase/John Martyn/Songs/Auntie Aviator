Auntie Aviator
Sooner than much later, we'll be there
Flying high above the clouds
Take a look and I'll be everywhere

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
I'll never let you down
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
We'll never touch the ground
And if we don't want to
We won't come down

Said I was a dreamer
That all I ever did was sit and stare
Take me out to no-man's land
If you want to, I can take you there

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
I'll never let you down
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
We'll never touch the ground
She's a good ship
She will fly

Now you're flying with me
We can take it easy for a while
Cruising far above the clouds
All I want to do is see you smile

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
I'll never let you down
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
We'll never touch the ground
And if we don't want to
We won't come down

And if we don't want to
We won't come down
And if we don't want to
We won't come down
And if we don't want to
We won't come down
