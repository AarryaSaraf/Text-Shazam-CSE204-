One flash of revelation, may never strike twice
One little touch of inspiration, going to sweeten your life
All the goodness in your secret self
All the friends that you can call on for help
All the ways you have to make people cry
All the ways you have to make yourself try

All in your favour
Everything is in your favour
All in your favour, bad boys, and bad girls
It's all in your favour

Coming down the wire with your anger, all that fire no need to be
You know where to go to know where to run you don't need to
Running around a field with your head in the air
Your feet on the ground and you don't know where
You are today but it's all in your favour

All in your favour
Running for blood, running for blood
All in your favour now, bad boys and bad girls
Running for blood, running for blood

Book it as you see it, it'll still be the same
Book it as you see it, at the end of the train
Book it as you see it, it'll still be the same
Book it as you see it
Book it as you see it, it'll still be the same
Book it as you see it, at the end of the train
Just book it as you see it, it just might be the same

One flash of revelation; lightning never strikes twice
One further flash of inspiration, might sweeten this life
Book it as you see it, ah book it as you see it
Just book it as you see it let me test you, come on down
Book it as you see it, step right down

Book it as you see it
Some things never change
Book it as you see it
Some things never change

Bad boys and bad girls
