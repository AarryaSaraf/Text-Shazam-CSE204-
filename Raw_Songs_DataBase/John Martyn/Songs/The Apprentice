I work at the station
At the heart of the nation
I tell you no lie
I keep the pace
In the energy race
I never ask why

I tell you the boss don't care
I know that the boss don't care
He don't even talk to me
Tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with the life I live
Tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with this world I'm in

Wouldn't it be good to get out of here
Wouldn't it be good to get out of here
Wouldn't it be good to get out of here
Wouldn't it be fine to get out

As cool as a river
Safe as a baby
So they say
So quiet, so cleanly
Shining discretely
Working away

I tell you the boss don't care
I know that the boss doesn't care
He don't even talk to me
Tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with this life I live
Please tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with this life I live

My eyes are so heavy
They follow the water
Down to the stream
My conscience is cloudy
My heart gets so weary
It cannot be, it never was my dream

I tell you the boss don't care, don't care
I know that the boss don't care
He don't even talk to me
Tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with this life I live
Please tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with this world I'm in
Tell me
What's wrong with this life I live?

Tell me, what's wrong, what's wrong
