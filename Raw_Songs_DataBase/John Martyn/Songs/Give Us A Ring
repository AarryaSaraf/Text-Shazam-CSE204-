Well now, what's the food like, have you slept well?
And do the bugs bite other people?
And did the banker give you money?
And I saw on the postcard that you wrote it
On a beach or on your pillow
Or on a book or something stiff

Give us a ring when you get back
Try to bring me something back
With the customs there
Make sure you don't get caught
With the things that you bought

Jeffrey, he bought a cactus for the kitchen
And the rabbit's been complaining
And we sat out on the lawn
Well now, I have to go to catch the postman
Cos I'm going to the pictures
Lots of love, I bet you're brown

Give us a ring when you get back
Try to bring me something back
With the customs there
Make sure you don't get caught
With the things that you bought

Give us a ring when you get back
Try to bring me something back
With the customs there
Make sure you don't get caught
With the things that you bought

Give us a ring when you get back
Give us a ring when you get back
Give us a ring when you get back
Give us a ring. Don't get caught
