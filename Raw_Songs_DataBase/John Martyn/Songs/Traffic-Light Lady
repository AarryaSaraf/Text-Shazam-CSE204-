All we had between us was a secret
And kept for just us two for just just now
If you tell nobody our se-secret
I'll pick you up and we'll go rollin' now

Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Amber, green and red surprise
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me

Won't you tell me 'bout the things that are you?
Won't you tell me 'bout your baby too?
Tell me 'bout the things you do together
And tell me 'bout the things that we could do

Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Amber, green and red surprise
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me

All we had between us was a secret
And kept for just us two for just just now
If you tell nobody our se-secret
I'll pick you up and we'll go rollin' now

Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Amber, green and red surprise
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me
Traffic light lady
Turn your eyes on me
