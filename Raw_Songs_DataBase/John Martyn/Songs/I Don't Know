Bet you never saw me be a horse
That's because I never was of course
But it all seems worthwhile
I can just see you smile like you do
Like you do today

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

I love you lady
Don't you know lady
I love you

Bet you never saw me climb a tree
That's because it isn't me
But it all seems worthwhile
I can just see you smile like you do
Like you do today

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

I love you lady
Lady I love you
I fly a yard and crawl a mile
If I could think of something else meanwhile
It all seems so true if I could be like you
Like I was, like I was today

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

I love you lady
Don't you know lady
I love you

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

Lady don't you know that you never have to go
I'm going to make you smile
Every little while in a little time

I love you lady
Don't you know lady
I love you
