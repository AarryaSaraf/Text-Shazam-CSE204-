She's a little strange
Just a little strange
A little strange

I would walk a city mile
Just to see that silly smile
She's a little strange
I would walk that country road
Even though I'm always told
She's a little strange

She's just a little strange
She's just a little strange
Just a little strange
That's all, she just a little strange

If you ask her, she'll tell you she's fine
If you ask me, I will put it on the line
If she asked me, I might be so truthless
If she asked me, I might be ruthless

I'm a little strange
I'm just a little strange
I'm a little strange
I'm just a little strange

When it comes to being certain
You can tell she's not so sure
She's just a little strange
When it comes down to my smile
I swear I know just who I'm smiling for

Well just a little strange
Just a little strange
We're just a little strange, brother
She and me's just a little strange

When I come down to the corner
She's been known to walk right by
She's a little strange
When she walks down to the highway
She somehow seems invisible

Just a little strange
Well just a little strange
She's just a little strange
Just a little strange

I would walk a city mile
Just to see that silly smile
She's just so lovely strange
When it comes to being certain
You can tell she's not so sure
She's a little strange

Just a little strange
We're just a little strange, you and me, you and me
Just a little strange, just a little strange
Just a little strange, just a little strange
Just a little strange
Just a little strange
