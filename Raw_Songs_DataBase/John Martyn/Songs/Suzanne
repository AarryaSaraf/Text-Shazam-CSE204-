A long time since I saw love in my garden
A long time since I met love at my door
Sometimes I thought I knew you
Sometimes I saw straight through you
Lord I hope I never see you no more

Where are you now, Suzanne?
Sometime I think I dreamed it from the start
Where are you now, Suzanne
Tell me how to run to your heart

I was holding on to my imagination
Imagining you'd be the only one
Seemed like every time I kissed you
Just another way to miss you
I should have known that love was on the run

Where are you now, Suzanne?
Sometimes I think I dreamed you from the start
Where are you now, Suzanne
Tell me what you've done
Tell me what you do this time
Tell me what you do to my heart

Well I know you could have loved the man that I could never be
You know you never loved me like I am
Well I tried so hard to hold you
And never even told you
I knew inside you loved some other man

Where are you now, Suzanne?
Sometimes I think I dreamed you from the start
Where are you now, Suzanne?

Where are you now, Suzanne
Where are you now, tell me
