You know I
Actually hardly ever drink this stuff

But funny or not now
I can't seem to get enough

I got nothing 'gainst life
Just sometimes it kills

Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?

'Cause I'm gettin' the chills

You know I always knew
That you would surely understand
After all
I'm just a guy who's living in his van

Maybe in the next life
I'll come back as a disease

Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?

'Cause I'm startin' to freeze

So babe
Would you come down
To the night of the bereft?

First you gotta go right
Then you gotta go left

Parked in the moonlight
Yeah, 'Neath the Marigold

Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?

It's just gettin' so cold

Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?

It's gettin' so cold

(Ooooh!)

It's gettin' so cold

(It's gettin' there!)
