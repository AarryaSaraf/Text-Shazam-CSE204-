A few dark words
You said to me
I drew a blank
And then I flew
I walked the plank
Into the blue
My heart beat it leaks
Of silence

I walked along
The coral snow
I saw some lights
An old hotel
The bell was rung
The glass is filled
That cloudy drink that blackened smile

The shade is drawn
With stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine
And golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning

You said at last
Let's have a duel
Out by the pines
The day is warm
I played the fool
And when it passed
The gadflies swarmed
And then they died

The shade is drawn
With stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine
And golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning

The shade is drawn
With stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine
And golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning

The shade is drawn
With stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine
And golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning
