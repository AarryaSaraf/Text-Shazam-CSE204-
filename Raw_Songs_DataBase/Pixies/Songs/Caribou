I live cement

I hate this street

Give dirt to me

I bite lament

This human form

Where I was born

I now repent


Caribou  
Caribou  
Caribou  



Repent

Re-pe-ent


Give me white

Ground to run

And foregone

Lets me knife

Knife me lets

I will get

What I like


Caribou  
Caribou  
Caribou  



Repent

Rep-pent
