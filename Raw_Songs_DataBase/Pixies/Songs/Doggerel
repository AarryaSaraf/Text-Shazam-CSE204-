Three pretty boys did Gabriel get
The youngest George by name, Sir
A funny dog, not favoured much
By fortune or by fame, Sir

Down in the cold rain
Down the valley
Bottom of the hill
1st Baron Coleraine
Gabriel Hanger
Has sent a bell

On the road to somewhere
On the road to nowhere
It's the same to me
With a band of robbers
Or down the bottom
Bottom of the sea

I'll never wander again
I'll never wander again
I'm gonna stay to the end
Here with you

I'll never wander again
I'll never wander again
I'm gonna stay to the end
Here with you
Here with you

I'm gonna stay to the end
I'm gonna stay to the end

I'll never wander again
I'll never wander again
I'm gonna stay to the end
Here with you

I'll never wander again
I'll never wander again
I'm gonna stay to the end
Here with you

Wander again
Wander again
Gonna stay to the end
Here with you
Wander again
Wander again
