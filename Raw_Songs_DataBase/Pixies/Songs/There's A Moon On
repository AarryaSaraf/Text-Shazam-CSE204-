Day after day seems about the same
Same old people playing same old games
But some days are different when the moon
Shines bright
There's a storm in your brain on a full moon night

There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on

Don't like to fight don't like to spit
Don't like a steak with no pepper on it
No, I don't like to spit and I don't like to fight
I won't like to be alone on a full moon night

There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on

I can make like a dog and give my tail a shake
Make like a frog and go jump in a lake
Make like a cock and cock-a-doodle do
Make like I'm gonna make love to you

There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on
