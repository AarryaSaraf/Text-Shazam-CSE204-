Here in the vault of heaven
While trying to titrate
I ended up in another case

I went to 711
To try and get me straight
I ended up there in outer space

There in the vault of heaven
Trying to titrate
I ended up in some dire straits
And that's OK

Again to 711
'Cause I think they're pretty great
I ended up here flat on my face

Here in the vault of heaven
Just trying to keep me straight
But I ended up still in outer space

Here in the vault of heaven
Trying to titrate
I ended up in some dire straits
But that's ok
