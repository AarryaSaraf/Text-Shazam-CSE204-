I don't have pills or the thrills to survive
Some say I've never lived but I know I'm alive
You always say that I'm living in my head
But I will cry for you long after you're dead

Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now

Don't have a bike, I don't go out very much
All I ever wanted was your skin for to touch
I'll always love you, I will always say your name
But if you join me then I'll know you feel the same

Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now

Let it be said I'm a little narcissist
But my favorite rock and roll is Sealed With A Kiss

Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now

Get simulated
Get simulated
Get simulated
Get simulated
Get simulated
