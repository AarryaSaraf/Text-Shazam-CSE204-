Today's the day
That we're closest to the sun
And everyone's invited
But anyway
Tomorrow comes
In this we are united

Favorite line
From a song that'll take you back
Out of the blue into the black

Favorite sign
That the Lord ain't coming back
You break your mama if you step on a crack

Good times
'Cause I know that today is the day
Good signs
Yes, the Lord has come back today

Lose your mind
Then you going to lose track
For all the things for what you lack

Good times
'Cause I know that today is the day
Good signs
Yes, the Lord has come back today

Today's the day
That we're closest to the sun
And everyone's invited
But anyway
Tomorrow comes
In this we are united
