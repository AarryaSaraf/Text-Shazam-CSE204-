I went to your house
I knocked very hard

She won't wake up
I slept in the yard

A German and a Russian
And a Frenchman do their best

The Frenchman had a breakdown
So they gave it all a rest

You took a boat to Indochine
And you partied in Saigon

But they followed him
And they begged to him
That they should carry on

I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't break it to you

I slept at the bar
I'm not feeling fresh

I hear the roar
Of fighter jets

I went to your house
They bulldozed it down

I danced at a barn
But you weren't around

Lying on my back
Little ground has come to feed

I tightened up my necktie
'Lest the brownies make me bleed

I thought of my inheritance
I did receive today

A few drops for my troubles
And a thing for Morgan le Fay

I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't break it to you
