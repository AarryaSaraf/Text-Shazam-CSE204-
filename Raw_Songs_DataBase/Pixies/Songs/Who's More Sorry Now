I swept the closet floor
I found some metaphors
A pair of running shoes
And something overdue

I said but who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
You know, you know, you know

See how much we owe
Not much I suppose
For Henry David Thoreau

I said but who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
You know, you know, you know

Don't split your sails over me
No, no
'Cause it just don't matter
Don't split your sails over me
No, no
'Cause it just don't matter

I found a mannequin
Inside a plastic bin

I said but who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
You know, you know, you know

Don't split your sails over me
No, no, no
'Cause it just don't matter
Don't split your sails over me
No, no, no
'Cause it just don't matter
