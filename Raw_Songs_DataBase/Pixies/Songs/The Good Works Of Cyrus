I heard the words of Cyrus
Stopped at the light one day

He blessed me for the offering
Then he looked at me and said:
"There is a flood that's comin'
So make your plans for runnin'
Far away"

There is a flood that's comin'
So make your plans for runnin'

I paid him almost nothing
And nothing I have laid

I cursed the pearls of Cyrus
I threw them all away
Though high above it's sunny
There ain't no use in runnin'
Not today
