There's a house in English bond
Somebody planned to stay
Standing out near the button pond
It never went away

How many fish do make the shoal?
I cannot count today
What is your wish for these button holes?
I think I want to stay

Haunted house all full of ghosts
I'm gonna pass that way
Haunted house where I want to go
I'm gonna go today

North or south is the only way
I know I cannot tire
A haunted house that's built to stay
Is setting me on fire

Haunted house all full of ghosts
I'm gonna pass that way
Haunted house where I want to go
I'm gonna go today

Haunted house where I want to go
Haunted house where I want to go
Haunted house where I want to go
Haunted house where I want to go

Somebody planned to stay
It never went away
