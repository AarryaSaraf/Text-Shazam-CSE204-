I'm not proud
But I know that I'm sane
Like a grouse
Who's resigned to the blade

If you doubt
And you think I'm profane
I'm in the arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain

My memories are all fables
So I'm trying to get back to truth
And if you think I am able
Well, have I got some news for you
I'm in the arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain

Hollywood
Yes its always the same
But it feels so damn good
So I know I'll be staying
No I'm not on the foot
I been trying to explain
I'm in the arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain
I'm in the arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain
I'm in the arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain
