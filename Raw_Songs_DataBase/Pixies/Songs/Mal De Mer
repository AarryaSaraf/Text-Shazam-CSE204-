Never moved by my appeal
All my teenage sorrows

I always die behind the wheel
On the coastal highway

I was feeling mal de mer
From all that teenage violence

Voices in the smoggy air
All my teenage sorrows

Now I'm cut up in the plume
With stop see you sideways

Now I'm ribbons in the spoon
And the world is silence

I was feeling mal de mer
All my teenage sorrows
All my teenage sorrows

(Teenage sorrows)

I was feeling mal de mer
All my teenage sorrows

(All my teenage sorrows)
(Teenage sorrows)
