You know, I know that you don't really hate me
But I suppose that I probably irritate you
And furthermore I know that I can relate to you
I'll say I'm sorry in advance for all of my hyperbole
Don't waste your time on me
Don't waste your time on me

And you know, I really, really, really care for you
But I see lately you're a little absentee
I'm sure that you have had your fair share, your fair share of me
So why do you come here lately after all that we've been through?
Don't waste my time on you
Don't waste my time on you

It's Nomatterday, here we go again
Necromancers bending to and fro
Feels like a Saturday
That never seems to end

Feast of burden that-away
Beast of famine that-away
Easter Bunny that-away

I said hey-ey-ey-ey
Don't piss in the fountain
I said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Don't piss in the fountain
I said hey-ey-ey-ey
Don't piss in the fountain
I said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Don't piss in the fountain

It's Nomatterday, I call up all my friends
And we go dancing at the show
But when the spirits call
It's all shenanigans

Feast of burden that-away
Beast of famine that-away
Easter Bunny that-away

I said hey-ey-ey-ey
Don't piss in the fountain
I said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Don't piss in the fountain
I said hey-ey-ey-ey
Don't piss in the fountain
I said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Don't piss in the fountain

I said hey
I said whoa
I said hey
I said whoa
