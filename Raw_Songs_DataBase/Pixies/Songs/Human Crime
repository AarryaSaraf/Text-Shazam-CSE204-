I'm sorry I missed you
I was already gone
No goodbye kiss
No one for me to lean on
Into the blue sky
Takes me far away
Into the sunset
Rising in from another day

Don't you be unkind
That's a human crime
Don't you be so blind
It'll come back to you sometime

I went round your place
There was nobody there
At the cocktail lounge
Someone else was in your chair
Now even the sunshine
Feels like misery
Even the blue skies
Are falling down on me

Don't you be unkind
That's a human crime
Don't you be so blind
It'll come back to you sometime
Don't you be unkind
That's a human crime
Don't you be so blind
It'll come back to you sometime

Don't you be unkind
That's a human crime
Don't you be so blind
It'll come back to you sometime
Don't you be unkind
That's a human crime
Don't you be so blind
It'll come back to you sometime

Come back to you sometime
Come back to you sometime
