I got a message from Julie
I got my head in the clouds

I asked her if she would screw me
She said "you better start to lookin' for ground"

Dedication
To medication

We regret to inform
We're never satisfied

How I learned to earn rewards
How I learned to please the lords

How I learned to earn rewards
How I learned to please the lords

I never dream when I slumber
I never shoot when I aim

And since you're knowin' my name now baby
Wouldn't you please look at the number

Dedication
To medication

We regret to inform
We're never satisfied

How I learned to earn rewards
How I learned to please the lords

How I learned to earn rewards
How I learned to please the lords
