Caught in a dream
That you can't get out of

Lost in a sea
That goes on forever

I wonder if we'll ever be together

Just out of reach
Caught in a dream

Not to be found
C'mon reach out reach out
And catch me

Just out of reach
Caught in a dream

Not to be found
C'mon reach out reach out
And catch me

Caught in a dream
That you can't get out
C'mon and reach out and catch me

Caught in a dream
That you can't get out of

Lost in a sea
That goes on forever

I wonder if we'll ever be together

Caught in a dream
That you can't get out
C'mon and reach out and catch me

Caught in a dream
That you can't get out
C'mon and reach out reach out reach out reach out
And catch me
