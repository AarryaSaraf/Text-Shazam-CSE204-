While I prefer the original version of 'You Really Got Me'
She will defer to the Van Halen version

Took the boat to the Hacienda
Through swimming pools oh so placid
Saw Redd Foxx took a hit of acid
Saw the smiling queen of Thailand

And then it's time to go
I said it's time to go
Are we gonna make it?
Are we gonna make it?
We gotta face it
Are we gonna make it?

We done run out of all our tricks
We flew a plane with lion tamers
Back to Brazil in 66
End of the world and I don't blame her

And then it's time to go
It's really time to go
But are we gonna make it?
Are we gonna make it?
We gotta face this
Are we gonna make it?

Drinking the dregs of the wine
Under the Hollywood sign
Drinking the dregs of the wine
'Til it's gone

Drinking the dregs of the wine
Under the Hollywood sign
Drinking the dregs of the wine
There's no more

It has the charm of hepcat circuit jazz
It has the swagger of a snake with arms
