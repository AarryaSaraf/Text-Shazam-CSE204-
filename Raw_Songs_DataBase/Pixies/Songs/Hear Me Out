Got this problem
In my life
It's what this song is all about
Hear me out

All I'm trying to say is it's alright
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
It's okay

Tried it this way
And I tried it that way
Can't say it worked out
In any old way
Hear me out

All I'm trying to say is it's alright
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
It's okay

Heard a rumour
You've packed and gone

All I'm trying to say is it's alright
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
