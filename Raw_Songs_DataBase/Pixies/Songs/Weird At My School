My father lives in Arabia

And I live right here at my school


I took his plane to Columbia

So I could sell at my school


It's weird at my school

Weird at my school 


My mother's glad that I am here

So she can visit my school


I can't believe she's so pretty

I'm a son of a bitch at my school


Weird at my school 


And my best friend, my cousin Eleanor

She lives far away from the doors of my school


And often times, you know I fantasize

That I have sex with the nuns at my school


It's weird at my school

Weird at my school
