This drink is tranquilizing
Just look at us two
Asleep at the beach at Waikiki

So I find it very surprising
He's coming to you
But I am thankful that he
Helped me to see

You say he's not around
Aw, would you please
I've seen you looking down
At me

Have you seen the death horizon
Just there out of view
Way low in the sky beyond the sea

And I can feel that the temperatures rising
But what can ya do

Cause that death horizon
Gonna pull you right through

You say hes not around
Aw, would you please
I've seen you looking down
At me

Have you seen the death horizon
Just there out of view
Way low in the sky beyond the sea
