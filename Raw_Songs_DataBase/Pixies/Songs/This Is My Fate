Lake of the long ton
Of the angel cake
Only got one
Dirty mandrake

"Hold that train"
I told that skinner man
This is my place
This is my fate

Cross of the long arm
Wine that's fortified
Now to hasten
Crucifixion

"Hold that train"
I told that skinner man
This is my place

Take a little more drink
It's alright
Take a little more drink
It's alright
Take a little more drink
It's alright
Take a little more drink
This is my fate

"Hold that train"
I told that skinner man

Hey mourning spirits
Singing harmony
Borax Mine Works
Valley of death

"Hold that train"
I told that skinner man
This is my place

Take a little more drink
It's alright
Take little more drink
It's alright
Take a little more drink
It's alright
Take a little more drink

This is my fate
This is my place
This is my fate
This is my place
This is my fate
This is my place
This is my fate
My fate
My fate
