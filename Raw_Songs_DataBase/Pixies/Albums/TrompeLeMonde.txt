Album: TrompeLeMonde

// Trompe Le Monde //

Why do cupids and angels

continually haunt her dreams

like memories of another life

is painted on her shirt in capital

out on the free free way

there's only she an the they

represented by the lights

we went to the store and bought something great

which samples this song from washington state

go

go little record go

it is named by

some guy named joe

and the words

are the letters of the words

said

electrically played

for outer space and those of they who paid

this song is twice ocurred

and now its time to go

away on holiday.

// Planet Of Sound //

One fine day in my odd past

i picked me up a transmission

i turned the fission ignition

went looking for the broadcaster

and when i first touched some ground

they simply told me leave

was kind of hard to believe

'cause there was not one around

this ain't the planet sound

this ain't the planet sound

this ain't the planet sound

this ain't the planet sound

i had a talented wine

that land o' classical gas

and on the planet of glass

they sent me skipping through time

igot to somewhere renowned

for it's canals and color of red

and lots of guys who shook their heads

rhythmically to resound

this ain't the planet of sound

this ain't the planet of sound

this ain't the planet of sound

this ain't the planet of sound

this ain't no rock and roll town

this ain't no fuckin' around

this ain't no planet of sound

i met a guy in a rover

he said its one more over

its just there where your bound

this ain't the planet of sound

this ain't the planet of sound

this ain't the planet of sound

this ain't the planet of sound.

// Alec Eiffel //

Pioneer of aerodynamics

(little eiffel, little eiffel)

they thought he was real smart alec

(little eiffel, little eiffel)

he thought big they called it a phallic

(little eiffel, little eiffel)

they didn't know he was panoramic

little eiffel stands in the archway

(little eiffel, little eiffel)

keeping low doesn't make no sense

sometimes people can be oh so dense

they didn't want it but he built it anyway

(little eiffel, little eiffel)

little eiffel stands in the archway

(little eiffel, little eiffel)

keeping low don't make sense

keeping low doesn't make no-sense

(little eiffel, little eiffel)

little eiffel stands in the archway

oh alexander i see you beneath

the archway of aerodynamics.

// The Sad Punk //

I smell smoke

taht comes from a gun

named extintion

it was a long time ago

could have happened to anyone

he was struck by a bullet

and he melted into fluid named extintion

one thousand miles an hour

i'm just like anyone

i want to feel

the road of tar beneath the wheel named extinction

and evolving from the sea

would no be too much time for me

to walk beside you in the sun

i read something

about a son of a gun

named extinction.

// Head On //

As soon as I get my head around you

I come around catching sparks off you

I get an electric shock from you

This secondhand living just won't do

And the way I feel tonight

I could die and I wouldn't mind

And there's something going on inside

Makes you wanna feel

Makes you wanna try

Makes you wanna blow the stars from the sky

And I can't stand up

I can't cool down

I can't get my head off the ground

As soon as I get my head around you

I come around catching sparks off you

And all I ever got from you

Was all I ever took from you

Yeah, the world could die in pain

And I wouldn't feel no shame

And there's nothing holding me to blame

Makes you wanna feel

Makes you wanna try

Makes you wanna blow the stars from the sky

And I'm taking myself to a dirty part of town

Where all my troubles can't be found

I said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

And I'm taking myself to a dirty part of town

Where all my troubles can't be found

Makes you wanna feel

Makes you wanna try

Makes you wanna blow the stars from the sky

// Palace Of The Brine //

In a place they say is dead

in the lake that's like an ocean

i count about a billion head

all the time

there's a motion

palace of the brine

i saw the cloning

of the famous family

i heard the droning

in the shrine

of the sea-monkey

palace of the brine

beneath reflections in the fountain

the starry sky and utah mountains

they are swimming happily

can't you see

a life that's so sublime

palace of the brine.

// Letter To Memphis //

The day since i met her

i can't believe it's true

she came here from memphis

across the ocean sailing

and i saw her a i pleaded

why do you come so far and she said

trying to get to you

how i tried to get you

trying to get you

i'm sending a letter

i'll send it right to you

i'll send it to memphis

i know that someday

everything i needed and i wanted

used to be that my head was haunted

and all these sirens they make me mad

and all this violence it brings me down

i feel strong i feel lucky

trying to get to you

said i'm going to get to you

trying to get to you.

// Bird Dream Of The Olympus Mons //

Speed leaving without

warning

i need some place to sleep tonight

blowing in the rocking of the pine

speed leaving without warning

the sunlight is going

into the mountain

i will crawl

into the mountain

sun shines in the rusty morning

skyline of the olympus mons

i think about it sometimes

sun shines in the rusty morning

once i had a good fly

into the mountain

i will fall.

// Space (I Believe In) //

We needed something to move and fill up the space

we needed something this always is just the case

jefrey with one f jeffery took up his place

sat on a carpet and with tablas in hand took up the chase

jefrey with one f jefrey

now it occurred to me as he drove away

d= r x t

spacious (he's so) spacios

space

(i belive in ) space

jefrey with one f jeffery

now i'm going to sing the perry mason theme

(he's so) spacious

spacious

(he's so) spacious

(he's so) spacious

jefrey with one f jeffery

jefrey with one f jeffery

jefrey with one f one f.

// Subbacultcha //

This is a song about something there

there is something about this song

we did the clubs what ass

i was hoping to have her in the sack

i was looking handsome

she was looking like an erotic vulture

i was all dressed in black

she was all dressed up in black

every thing was fine down here

what you call it here

call it what you will here

way down down down in this subbacultcha

her warm white belly in the life i'd lived had seen nothing

finer she shakes and she moves me or something

she's like jellyroll like sculpture

i was wearing eyeliner

she was wearing eyeliner

it was so good down here

saving for my scrapbook here

way down down down in this subbacultcha

now we live on the sea and relax and ride the tack

drug running on this panamanian schooner

she walks the deck in a black dress

and me i dress up in black

and we listen to the sea

and look at the sky in a poetic kind of way

what you call it

when you look at the sky in a poetic kind of way

you know when you grope for luna.

// Distance Equals Rate Times Time //

I had a vision

there wasn't any television

from looking into the sun

looking into the sun

we got to think quick

says blind st. nick hey

from looking into the sun

looking into the sun

we got to get some beer

we got no atmosphere

from looking into the sun

looking into the sun

i had a vision

there wasn't any television

from looking into the sun.

// Lovely Day //

At the station, at the border an egression to the exterior law and order

upward plantation

i remember your red dress

like a field full o' poppy

you were making me dreamy

stunned by a love got to do what your head says

could not let it stop me

they got one leaving today

and it's going away

got my feet in the stirrup

it can be kind of banal

but i dream of your red dress

riding down these dry canals

oh baby it's not europe

but i'm sending you money

i'm sending you lots of money

so you can buy a ticket

you will be my martian honey all the day

they got one leaving today

and it's going away.

// Motorway To Roswell //

Las night he could not make it

he tried hard but could not make it

last night he could not make it

on a holiday

for many miles

looking for a place to stay

near some friendly star

he found this mote

and now we wonder where we are

how could this so great

turn so shitty

he ended up in army crates

and photographs in files

his tiny boat

sparked as he turned to grazed our city

i started driving on the motorway

i was feeling down

last night he could not make it

last night he could not make it

he tried hard but he could not make it

last night he could not make it

on a holiday

so many miles

looking for a place to stay

near some friendly star

he found this mote

and now we wonder

how could this so great

turn so shit

he ended up in army crates

and photographs in files

his tiny boat

sparked as he grazed it

he started heading for the motorway

and he came right now.

// The Navajo Know //

Upon construction

there is the mohawk

his way of walking

quite high above the ground

fearless of looking down

skywalk

some people say that

the navajo know

a way of walking

quite high above the ground

fearless of looking down

oh no.
