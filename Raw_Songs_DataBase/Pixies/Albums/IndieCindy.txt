// Andro Queen //

Now Andro Queen has lost her ring
I think it used to sit right here
Encrusted in blue and hard and true
For now I will kiss her finger

Have you ever seen Andro Queen
Wandering all for her ruby
One day she'll come in through my window
Yes, she gave me her own true pledge

For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
That's how it's been with Andro Queen

Loving on our bed of flowers
Breathing in the smell of her musk
In a moon of milk she is scared, yes she is
Yet she shows me under her silk

For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
I wave goodbye to Andro

Mi aspekti al la ĉielo por via reveni
Mi aspekti ĉe via mano al vidi la ringo
Kaj ni will promeni kune al via cambro
Nia ami will esti nova
Nia ami will esti nova

She's off in a silver rocket
Off to the gas and rings of Saturn
Off her head she gave me a lock, yes she did
For my neck a rusted locket

For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh

// Indie Cindy //

Put this down for the record
It's more or less uncheckered
Wasted days and wasted nights
Made me a fucking beggar
No soul, my milk is curdled
I'm the Bürgermeister of purgatory

Look out for that hot plate
Guess that's all you got, great
You put the cock in cocktail, man
Well, I put the tail in – wait
Watch me walk
Blowtorch a hole in that armor
And I don't need the tip

I'm in love with your daughter
And though she has no need
I'm the one who's got some trotters
You've many mouths to feed

Indie Cindy
Be in love with me
I beg for you to carry me

Mixed messages from Sir Naff
Please authenticate
Just to be sure that you're a sap
Set for stun automatica
Crap is the operative
Locomotive of the longest death

There goes Indie Cindy whose
sails were black when it was windy
We offed ourselves in a lover's pact
We threw ourselves into the sea
Well look-see what the wind washed back
As we follow the bouncing ball
They call this dance the washed-up crawl

I'm in love with your daughter
And though she has no need
I'm the one who's got some trotters
You've many mouths to feed

I'm in love with your daughter
And though she has no need
I'm the one who's got some trotters
You've many mouths to feed

Indie Cindy
Be in love with me
I beg for you to carry me

Indie Cindy
Be in love with me
I beg for you to carry me

Indie Cindy
Be in love with me
I beg for you to carry me
I beg for you to carry me
I beg for you to carry me

// What Goes Boom //

Fatty had it made like a blade in the sun
Like a push in the bush when you got none
Ping pong bingo, fills a la Ringo
Analog bong but it ring wrong

Make some room
What goes boom

I'm a fatty in my caddy with my ponic blunt
Not a stunted runt looking natty
Cozy as a manger Chet Baker in the changer
Subs for my dub, really got you

Make some room
What goes boom

Grace
In her lace and her stocking
Carrying her bass
She really likes to get rocking
Oh darling Grace
Are we gonna get rocking?

I like that slinky little punky, little bit funky
Itty bitty chunky right there
Little bit lippy, a whipped cream hippie
Zip and unzippy and I want her

Make some room
What goes boom

Make some room
What goes boom

Grace
In her lace and her stocking
Carrying her bass
She really likes to get rocking
Oh darling Grace
Are we gonna get rocking?
Grace
Are we gonna get rocking?

(Make some room)
(What goes boom)

// Blue Eyed Hexe //

I went to make the vivisection
Saw the star carved on her chest
Goat of lust, attacking heaven
Points to the gaze of the blue eyed hexe

Blue eyed hexe
Blue eyed hexe
Hexe hexe
Blue eyed hexe

I tried to hide but I was not able
Shirt was opened down to her navel
Felt a burning in my solar plexus
Give me the pow-wow, give me the hexe

Blue eyed hexe
Blue eyed hexe
Hexe hexe
Blue eyed hexe

I called the Nixes from The Queets
Spirits take me through the straits
Closed my eyes to stop her vexing
Still the burning of the blue eyed hexe

Blue eyed hexe
Blue eyed hexe
Hexe hexe
Blue eyed hexe

Blue eyed hexe
Blue eyed hexe
Hexe hexe
Blue eyed hexe

// Greens And Blues //

I'm not together, and you know it's true.
My bits all wander in the trees.
And if I ever seem a little strange,
Would you excuse me please?

I said I'm human, but you know I lie.
I'm only visiting this shore.
I'll soon be leaving in the outbound tide
I pray again we will meet.

I'm wasting your time, just talking to you
Maybe best you go on home.
I'll leave you alone, fade from your mind, 
Slip into the greens and blues.

I said I'm human, but you know I lied.
I'm only visiting this shore.
I'll soon be leaving in the outbound tide.
I pray again we will meet.

I'm wasting your time, just talking to you
Maybe best you go on home.
I'll leave you alone, fade from your mind 
Slip into the greens and blues.

Greens and blues...

I'm wasting your time, just talking to you,
Maybe best you go on home.
I'll leave you alone, fade from your mind, 
Slip into the greens and blues.

I'm wasting your time, just talking to you,
Maybe best you go on home.
I'll leave you alone, fade from your mind, 
Slip into the greens and blues.

// Snakes //

Meet me by the coppice stool
Before the night takes back its jewels
Bring your life of memories
Before they sink into the seas

Snakes
Are coming to your town
In tunnels underground
Some travelling overground
A plague for our mistakes
They'll be right next to you
Snakes up against me too
There'll be nothing to do
When the rattle shakes

One more blast and then we're dry
Say some words, I'll write them down
Seal the couplets deep inside

Snakes
Are coming to your town
In tunnels underground
Some travelling overground
A plague for our mistakes
They'll be right next to you
Snakes up against me too
There'll be nothing to do
When the rattle shakes

// Bagboy //

I had a bad reaction to your public hobby writings 
Cover your breath, cover your teeth 
I get no satisfaction from your very recent sightings 
Cover your breath, polish your speech 
Cover your breath, cover your teeth 
Cover your breath, polish your speech 
Like when I hear a sound of feet slapping on the runway 
Cover your breath, polish your speech 
Like a small bird pretty while it's crapping on a new day 
Cover your breath, polish your teeth 
Cover your breath, polish your speech 

So disappointed I was that I had made small talk with you 
Polish your teeth, alter your breath 
I'm not feeling your buzz, I only smell your crack of stew 
Alter your teeth, cover your breath 

Bagboy [x8]

She had some beauty of manners, but she looked like a bug 
Cover your breath, alter your speech 
Migrations of their type are such good planners and not smug 
Cover your breath, alter your speech 

Bagboy (Bagboy) [x8]

You are proselytizing alone listening to the voice with your ears 
Cover your breath, cover your teeth 
You have regurgitated the tone, now sat in your tract for many years
Cover your breath, polish your speech 
Picked up from dead things that You licked 
It's a feedback loop you can't evict
Cover your breath, polish your teeth
Polish your teeth, cover your breath
Alter your teeth, cover your breath
Cover your breath, alter your speech

Bagboy [x3]

// Magdalena 318 //

I needed something to eat
I took a walk down the street
I came to 318
Saw my sweet Magdalene

Magdalena, you're the meanest, oh
Magdalena, you're the meanest, oh
Magdalena, sweet Magdalene

I went down deep in her hive
One year just turned into five
Night came and then it was gone
How did you get so strong

Magdalena, just between us, oh
You're the meanest, and the leanest, oh
Magdalena, how'd you get so strong

Magdalena, Magdalena, oh
Magdalena, Magdalena, oh
Magdalena

And then we started to drag
Me and my Maggie-mag-mag
I begged her please no no no
She said she got to go go go go go go

Magdalena, just between us, oh
You're the meanest, Magdalena, oh
Magdalena, you're the meanest, oh
Magdalena, Magdalena, oh
Magdalena, Magdalena

// Silver Snail //

On my way back to one
Half asleep with a loaded gun
In a room with a light bulb sun

Ain't no place for to hide
At an orgy of grooms and brides
At the scene of the suicides

Follow me
See my silver trails
Blessed be
When is a snake a tail?

I am the silver snail

On my way back to one
On my way back to seventh son
Then I count to a million

He will awake from his dreams
Find his way in these honey beams
Find a way to the cream of creams

Silver spoons
for my silver snails
Black harpoons
for the killer whales

I am the silver snail

On my way back to one
Half asleep with a loaded gun
In a room with a light bulb sun

On my way back to one
Half asleep with a loaded gun
In a room with a light bulb sun

// Ring The Bell //

Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Load your dhoni
Some cowrie shell

Hear the knell
Hear the knell
My heart is empty
Here come the swells

I've been away a long time
And though I've had some good times
I would have payed a crore
To see The Garland once more

I've been up here a long time
And now I see it's high time
To see The Garland once more
To walk with you there once more

Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Load your dhoni
Some cowrie shell

Hear the knell
Hear the knell
Load your dhoni
Here come the swells

Ring the bell
Ring the bell

I've been up here a long time
And now I see it's high time
To see The Garland once more
To walk with you there once more

I've been away a long time
And though I've had some good times
I would have payed a crore
To see The Garland once more

Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Load your dhoni
Say your farewell

Hear the knell
Hear the knell
My heart is empty
Here come the swells

Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Ring the bell

// Another Toe In The Ocean //

I have a drink
I start to sink
I put my toe in the ocean

I have a drink
I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean

Down on the shelf
An elf I saw
I took his picture he was waving

I passed again
And now they're gone
I think my picture is worth saving

No more waiting for a new day
You gotta swim sometimes

I'll be here for the rest of my life
Up in the land of green
Making love in the cool black sand
Thinking where I've been

Ooh
I put my toe in the ocean

Another toe in the ocean

Merry making
With the fairies
Going down to the onion patch

To you and me
To shining seas
I see the lights of Edward Thatch

No more waiting for a new day
You gotta swim sometimes

I'll be here for the rest of my life
Up in the land of green
Making love in the cool black sand
Thinking where I've been

Ooh
I put my toe in the ocean

I have a drink
I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean

Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah

I have a drink
I start to sink
I put my toe in the ocean

I have a drink
I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean

I have a drink
I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean

Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah
Aah

// Jaime Bravo //

Oh my, look at you go by
It's so nice just to see you

Oh oooh-oooh

It feels right here in the sunlight
And this ride is almost through

Oh oooh-oooh
Oh oooh-oooh

So goodbye and goodnight
I can't hide holding a bull's eye
A bullfighter and his crew

Oh oooh-oooh

It's so nice here in the sunlight
And this ride is almost through

Oh oooh-oooh
Oh oooh-oooh

So goodbye and goodnight
Goodbye and goodnight

Goodbye

La trapezista camina por la cuerda floja
Desde el D. F. y todo el mundo
Y ultimo a Zacatecas

So nice here in the sunlight
A bullfighter and his crew

Oh oooh-oooh
Oh oooh-oooh

So goodbye and goodnight
Goodbye and goodnight

Goodbye and goodnight

Goodbye
