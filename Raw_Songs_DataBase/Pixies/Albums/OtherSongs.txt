// Bailey's Walk //

Bailey!


He takes some steps

And bopped his head


He spins

(turns around) (?)


Takes some steps


Yeah!


The method 

Of stop, tap, spin


No talkin'

Bailey's walk


The method 

Of stop, tap, spin


Of no talkin' 

Bailey's walk


Bailey! [2X]


On parking lots and big highways

Daily!


It's crazy

Yeah!


The method 

Of stop, tap, spin


Of no talkin' 

Bailey's walk


The method 

Of stop, tap, spin

// Born In Chicago //

I was born in Chicago

1971

I was born in Chicago 1970

What my father told me,

"Son, you'd better get a gun."

My first friend went down

When I was 16 years old

Oh my first friend went down

When I was 16 years old

There's one thing I can say about that boy

He gotta go

My second friend went down

When I was 17 years of age

Oh my second friend went down

When I was 17 years of age

There's one thing I can say about that boy

He gotta pray

Oh life is a lie

If you don't know how to play the game

Oh life is a lie

If you don't know how to play the game

All my friends are going

And everything's gonna stay the same

// Build High //

Build high, build high
Build high, build high

'Cause my old man is bleeding
And my poor dog needs feeding
And this time I'm really broke
So let me feel your leg of hope around me

Build high, build high
Build high, build high
I said build high, yeah, build high
Build high, build high
Build high, build high

Hold me up with pride
Cause I'm not beautiful and
I don't have no pretty friends, can't pretend
I'm tired of believing in the things that go on here
Lately it makes me feel just like I'm forming in the air air air

Build high, build high
Build high, build high
I said build high, yeah, build high
Build high, build high
Build high, build high

// Dancing The Manta Ray //

Woooooo!

-Grunt-


Do the manta ray [4X]


Your head can go real screw 

with saucers chasing you


Dance the manta ray [5X]


Your head can go real screw 

with saucers chasing you


This don't swim-

-this fly

fly

c'mon


Your head can go real screw 

with saucers chasing you

// Evil Hearted You //

Corazon de diablo siempre me intentas rebajar,

Con las cosas que haces 

Y las palabras que difundes contra mi.


Corazon de diablo seguiras enganadome,

Con tu falsa sonrisa 

Y tus canciones de sirena,

Sonriendo enganando, coqueteas conmigo hasta que no hay esperanza,

Respondiendo degradando, de rodillas intento agradarte.

Pero te quiero sin embargo y te deseo piedad,

A mi lado y veras lo que significas para mi.


Corazon de diablo siempre me intentas rebajar,

Con las cosas que haces 

Y las palabras que difundes contra mi, sobre mi.


Corazon de diablo siempre me intentas rebajar,

Con las cosas que haces 

Y las palabras que difundes contra mi,sobre mi.


Que harias sin mi,sonriendo,enganando,

Coqueteas conmigo hasta que no hay esperanza.

[TRANSLATION]


Evil hearted you, you always try to lower me,

With the things that you do and the words you spread against me.


Evil hearted you, you will keep deceiving me,

With your false smile and your mermaid songs,

Smiling,deceiving,you flirt with me 'till there is no hope,

Responding degrading, on my knees I try to befriend you.

But I love you anyway and I wish you pity,

Beside me and you'll see what you mean to me.


Evil hearted you, you always try to lower me,

With the things that you do 

And the words you spread against me, over me.


Evil hearted you, you always try to lower me,

With the things that you do

And the words you spread against me,over me.


What would you do without me,smiling,deceiving.

You flirt with me 'till there's no hope.

// Hang On To Your Ego //

I know so many people who think they can do it alone

They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zone

What can you tell them?

What can you say that will make them defensive?

Hang on to your ego

Hang on but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

They come on like they're peaceful but inside they're so uptight

They trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night

Now how can I say it?

How can I come on when I know I'm guilty?

Yeah, hang on to your ego

Hang on but I know you're gonna lose the fight

// Hear Me Out //

Got this problem
In my life
It's what this song is all about
Hear me out

All I'm trying to say is it's alright
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
It's okay

Tried it this way
And I tried it that way
Can't say it worked out
In any old way
Hear me out

All I'm trying to say is it's alright
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
It's okay

Heard a rumour
You've packed and gone

All I'm trying to say is it's alright
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright

// Human Crime //

I'm sorry I missed you
I was already gone
No goodbye kiss
No one for me to lean on
Into the blue sky
Takes me far away
Into the sunset
Rising in from another day

Don't you be unkind
That's a human crime
Don't you be so blind
It'll come back to you sometime

I went round your place
There was nobody there
At the cocktail lounge
Someone else was in your chair
Now even the sunshine
Feels like misery
Even the blue skies
Are falling down on me

Don't you be unkind
That's a human crime
Don't you be so blind
It'll come back to you sometime
Don't you be unkind
That's a human crime
Don't you be so blind
It'll come back to you sometime

Don't you be unkind
That's a human crime
Don't you be so blind
It'll come back to you sometime
Don't you be unkind
That's a human crime
Don't you be so blind
It'll come back to you sometime

Come back to you sometime
Come back to you sometime

// I Can't Forget //

I stumbled out of bed

I got ready for the struggle

I smoked a cigarette

And I tightened up my gut

I said this can't be me

Must be my double

And I can't forget

And I can't forget

I can't forget but I don't remember what

I'm burning up the road

I'm heading down to Phoenix

I got this old address

Of someone that I knew

It was high and fine and free

Oh you should've seen us

And I can't forget

And I can't forget

Ican't forget but I don't remember who

I'll be there today with a big bouquet of cactus

I've got this rig that runs, runs on memory

And I promise, cross my heart they'll never catch us

But if they do just tell 'em it was me

I've loved you all my life

And that's how I want to end it

The summer's almost gone

And winter's tuning up

The summer's gone but a lot goes on forever

And I can't forget

I can't forget

I can't forget, but I don't remember what

// I've Been Waiting For You //

I've been looking

For a woman

To save my life

Not to beg, or to borrow

A woman

With the feeling

Of losing once or twice

Who knows how it could be tomorrow?

I've been waiting for you

And you've been coming for me

For such a long time now

Such a long time now

A woman

With the feeling

Of losing once or twice

Who knows how it could be tomorrow?

I've been waiting for you

And you've been coming for me

For such a long time now

Such a long time now

// In Heaven (The Lady In The Radiator Song) //

In Heaven

Everything is fine


In Heaven

Everything is fine


In Heaven 

Everything is fine

You got your good thing

And I've got mine


In Heaven

Everything is fine


In Heaven

Everything is fine


In Heaven 

Everything is fine

You got a your good thing

And you've got mine


In Heaven

Everything is fine


In Heaven


In Heaven

Everything is fine

You've got a your good thing

And you've got mine


In Heaven

Every thing is fine

// Into The White //

And there ain't no night

And there ain't no night


Did you hear what I said

Come into the white (?)


Into the White [3X]


And there ain't no day

And there ain't no day


And there ain't no night 

And there ain't no night


Into the White [3X]


Did you hear what I said?

Did you hear what I said?


Deeper than your sleepy haed

Deeper than your sleepy head


Ain't nothin' to see

Ain't nothin' in sight


Into the white [3X]


Go, and you'll go real far

Go, and you'll go real far


Just past the big quasar

Just past the big quasar


Can't hitch a meteorite

Can't hitch a meteorite


Into the white [13X]

// Make Believe //

I've been lost

Since she's gone

The piano

She's really on

I don't want you to

Marry me

Make believe

You're Debbie G

Come look down on

Who you are

She is love

With a voice

And a shape that's my guitar

I don't want you

You want me

Make believe

You're Debbie G

Make believe

You're Debbie G

Make believe

You're Debbie G

// Mambo Sun //

Beneath the bebop moon
I want to croo
With you
Beneath the Mambo Sun
I got to be the one
With you, with you

My life's a shadowless horse
If I can't get across
To you
In the alligator rain
My heart's all pain
For you, for you

Girl you're good
And I've got wild knees
For you
On a mountain range
I'm Dr. Strange
For you, for you

Upon a savage lake
Make no mistake
I love you
I got a powder-keg leg
And my wig's all pooped
For you, for you

With my head in my hands
I'm a hungry man
For you
I got stars in my beard
And I feel real weird
For you

Beneath the bebop moon
I'm howling like a loon
For you
Beneath the Mambo Sun
I've got to be the one
For you, for you

// Manta Ray //

All in a day

All for me

Trek across the space

It'll be just like they say


Oo, oo, 

Oo, oo

Yeah


Since I am told

Month number three

He has no memory

Of flyers in the night


Oo, oo

Oo, oo

Yeah


They went away [2X]

My manta ray is all right [4X]


Police they say

My mother too

A fish from ocean blue

Above my head tonight


Oo, oo

Oo, oo

Yeah


There is a way [2X]

My manta ray is all right [7X]

(While Black Francis screams "All right!")

All right

// Rock A My Soul //

I turned you on the roof

Drink wine from your tears, rollin'.

// Weird At My School //

1-2-3-4


My father lives in Arabia

And I live right here at my school


I took his plane to Columbia

So I could sell at my school


It's weird at my school

Weird at my school [3X]


My mother's glad that I am here

So she can visit my school


I can't believe she's so pretty

I'm a son of a bitch at my school


Weird at my school [4X]


And my best friend, my cousin Eleanor

She lives far away from the doors of my school


And often times, you know I fantasize

That I have sex with the nuns at my school


It's weird at my school

Weird at my school [7X]

// Winterlong //

I waited for you winterlong

You seemed to be where I belong

It's all illusion anyway


If things should ever turn out wrong

And all the love we have is gone

It won't be easy

On that day


Waiting to follow 

Through the dream light of your way

Is not so easy for me now


After time has passed your way 

Things we thought of yesterday

Come back now

Comeback now

Whoahohhh


Waiting to follow 

Through the dream light of your way

Is not so easy for me now


After time has passed your way 

Things we thought of yesterday

Come back now

Comeback now

Whoahohhh


I waited for you winterlong

You seemed to be where I belong [repeat both lines 6X in sequence]
