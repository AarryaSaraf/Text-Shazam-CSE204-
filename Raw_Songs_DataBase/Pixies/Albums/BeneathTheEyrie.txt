// In The Arms Of Mrs. Mark Of Cain //

I'm not proud
But I know that I'm sane
Like a grouse
Who's resigned to the blade

If you doubt
And you think I'm profane
I'm in the arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain

My memories are all fables
So I'm trying to get back to truth
And if you think I am able
Well, have I got some news for you
I'm in the arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain

Hollywood
Yes its always the same
But it feels so damn good
So I know I'll be staying
No I'm not on the foot
I been trying to explain
I'm in the arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain
I'm in the arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain
I'm in the arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain

// On Graveyard Hill //

And when the moon grows smaller
Donna picks out a flower
Gives her a witchy power
There in the witching hour
In the witching hour

Donna's taking her potion
Eating all my devotion
Fucking up my emotion
In the witching hour
Donna picks her a flower
In the witching hour

On the graveyard hill
She's calling out her curse
I'm taking my last breath
With each chapter and each verse
And soon I will be killed

In the poisonous forest
Donna lights up her torches
Her eyes are flying saucers
Her hair is black and gorgeous

I see her down at the crossroads
She can lead you to madness
She's leading me into darkness
In the witching hour
In the witching hour
In the witching hour

On the graveyard hill
She's calling out her curse
I'm taking my last breath
With each chapter and each verse
And soon I will be killed

On the graveyard hill
She's calling out her curse
I'm taking my last breath
With each chapter and each verse
And soon I will be killed

And soon I will be killed

// Catfish Kate //

Call me devil call me friend but call me Black Jack Hooligan
I came all the way from Aberdeen to live among the go-betweens
Let me tell you tell you about Catfish Kate in the time before when she's just Kate
Here in the mountains all alone before the time we called this home

Where is my angel fallen down at the river bottom and will she get away?
Where is my Blackfoot blossom is she just playing possum who lives another day?

Here in the valley that we all know a river bend that's deep and slow
Where every creature drinks their fill and other creatures take their kill
Now Kate went to catch a fish to put inside her favorite dish
A catfish grabbed her by the head and took her to his house instead

Where is my angel fallen down at the river bottom and will she get away?
Where is my Blackfoot blossom is she just playing possum who lives another day?

Well, they wrestled all the day and night the morning showed the bloody sight
Kate all dressed in catfish clothes his whiskers for her catfish robe whiskers for her robe

Where is my angel fallen down at the river bottom and is she there to stay?
Where is my Blackfoot blossom is she just playing possum who lives another day?

Now she's known as Catfish Kate

// This Is My Fate //

Lake of the long ton
Of the angel cake
Only got one
Dirty mandrake

"Hold that train"
I told that skinner man
This is my place
This is my fate

Cross of the long arm
Wine that's fortified
Now to hasten
Crucifixion

"Hold that train"
I told that skinner man
This is my place

Take a little more drink
It's alright
Take a little more drink
It's alright
Take a little more drink
It's alright
Take a little more drink
This is my fate

"Hold that train"
I told that skinner man

Hey mourning spirits
Singing harmony
Borax Mine Works
Valley of death

"Hold that train"
I told that skinner man
This is my place

Take a little more drink
It's alright
Take little more drink
It's alright
Take a little more drink
It's alright
Take a little more drink

This is my fate
This is my place
This is my fate
This is my place
This is my fate
This is my place
This is my fate
My fate
My fate

// Ready For Love //

Don't mind the rain
But now it won't stop
You think that I'm vain
But I'm calling your bluff

I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready for love

You might think I'm vain
But I'm calling your bluff
I don't mind the rain
But I'm ready for love

I'm no poet, not a sailor
I don't find the setting sun
I'm succeeding as a failure
But I don't want to hurt no one

And I don't mind the rain
Ah but now it won't stop
You might think I'm vain
But I'm not
You might think I'm vain
But I'm calling your bluff

I'm ready for love
I'm ready for love

You might think I'm vain
But I'm calling your bluff
And I don't mind the rain
But I'm ready for love

So I'll sing it once again
I am ready for love

// Silver Bullet //

A few dark words
You said to me
I drew a blank
And then I flew
I walked the plank
Into the blue
My heart beat it leaks
Of silence

I walked along
The coral snow
I saw some lights
An old hotel
The bell was rung
The glass is filled
That cloudy drink that blackened smile

The shade is drawn
With stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine
And golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning

You said at last
Let's have a duel
Out by the pines
The day is warm
I played the fool
And when it passed
The gadflies swarmed
And then they died

The shade is drawn
With stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine
And golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning

The shade is drawn
With stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine
And golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning

The shade is drawn
With stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine
And golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning

// Long Rider //

Have you seen my Desiree?
She rides the sea of silver gray
You'll find her at the end of summer's day

The waves were high and crystal clean
If I were you and you were me
We would do the same as Desiree
Just slay it

Long Rider in the morning tide
She took the highway to the county line
She wiped out in the modern sense
Take it away now

Long Rider in the morning tide
She took the highway to the county line
She wiped out in the modern sense
Take it away now

I believe in Miki Dora "Da Cat"
I believe in Whitey, Greenough and Nat
I believe in Leonard, Peanuts and Yan
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe

Have you seen my Desiree?
She rides the wave of silver gray
Just slay it

Long rider in the morning tide
She took the highway to the county line
She wiped out in the modern sense
Take it away now

Long Rider in the morning tide
Took the highway to the county line
She wiped out in the modern sense
Take it away now

Long Rider in the morning tide
Took the highway to the county line
She wiped out in the modern sense
Just slay it

// Los Surfers Muertos //

On a beach near Mexico
Los Surfers Muertos raved
About a break on a shallow cove
The Killer Dana Wave

Los Surfers Muertos
Vivieron antes del puerto
Where she came from
She rode the wave on her long gun

"Just one more ride"
The last words she said
Killer Dana took her life instead
Went overhead
She caught her last big wave
Killer Dana took her life away

// St. Nazaire //

Down at the rocks at St. Nazaire
I took a bottle and a fucking prayer
I washed out with the greasy tide
I went down on the Selkie bride

Look how he's dead and her eyes all black
Just smells like spliff and Armagnac
She lost her coat, but I like her style
She lost her head, but I like her smile

I'm all done talking to you, oh
And I don't wanna beat you, no
I'm all done talking to you

I took a bottle and a fucking prayer
Down at the rocks at St. Nazaire
Look how he's dead and her eyes all black
I washed down never coming back

I'm all done talking to you, oh
And I don't wanna beat you, no
I'm done with talking to you

I'm all done talking to you, oh
And I don't wanna beat you, no
I'm done with talking to you

// Bird Of Prey //

Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie

I'll set my broken bone
With a twist and a crack
Now your cover's blown
You buried me, but I came back
You've stolen my tomorrow
So I come for it today
You stole it when you stole my yesterday

Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie

Here in my heart
I hear you far away
Deep in the dark
My little bird of prey
I have your mark

Well, I'm flying through the rag
Crack the whip from my cal√®che
I have the horse's speed
And if I need the horse's flesh
Fire for the tallow
But I still can't find the way
You stole it when you stole my yesterday

Here in my heart
I hear you far away
Deep in the dark
My little bird of prey
I have your mark
I hear you far way
Deep in my heart
My little bird of prey
I have your mark

Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie

// Daniel Boone //

Last night I was driving around
Nothing to do
Thinking of you
I sighted here on the bend
Reindeer and then it was through

And I floated toward the moon
And I noted from on high
That the Lord Howe reef
Looks like Daniel Boone
And he was showing me his smile

Last night I was driving around
Nothing to do
Thinking of you
I sighted there on the bend
Reindeer and then it was through

And I floated toward the moon
And I noted from on high
That the Lord Howe reef
Looks like Daniel Boone
And he was showing me his smile

Sometimes
I see white
Sometimes
Blue
Blue

And I'm floating down to you
And I'm noting from on high
That the Lord Howe reef
Looks like Daniel Boone
And he is showing me his smile
And he is showing me his smile

// Death Horizon //

This drink is tranquilizing
Just look at us two
Asleep at the beach at Waikiki

So I find it very surprising
He's coming to you
But I am thankful that he
Helped me to see

You say he's not around
Aw, would you please
I've seen you looking down
At me

Have you seen the death horizon
Just there out of view
Way low in the sky beyond the sea

And I can feel that the temperatures rising
But what can ya do

Cause that death horizon
Gonna pull you right through

You say hes not around
Aw, would you please
I've seen you looking down
At me

Have you seen the death horizon
Just there out of view
Way low in the sky beyond the sea

// The Good Works Of Cyrus //

I heard the words of Cyrus
Stopped at the light one day

He blessed me for the offering
Then he looked at me and said:
"There is a flood that's comin'
So make your plans for runnin'
Far away"

There is a flood that's comin'
So make your plans for runnin'

I paid him almost nothing
And nothing I have laid

I cursed the pearls of Cyrus
I threw them all away
Though high above it's sunny
There ain't no use in runnin'
Not today

// Please Don't Go //

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready

I take a puff and then I blow it out
And then it starts to decay

And so I'm hoping if I drag this on
I'll cause you some delay

Please don't go
Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

Please don't go
Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

If you go hunting for the grizzly bear
Don't bring a heavy load
You will want nothing that will weigh you down
'Cause then your heart will explode

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

// Chapel Hill //

(So she's friends with their manager)
(She says we can crash at his house)

All of this was not for nothing
All of this was not for

All of this was not for nothing
All of this was not for

(The air is crisper)
([?])
([?] calls the radio station)

All of this was not for nothing
All of this was not for nothing

// Caught In A Dream //

Caught in a dream
That you can't get out of

Lost in a sea
That goes on forever

I wonder if we'll ever be together

Just out of reach
Caught in a dream

Not to be found
C'mon reach out reach out
And catch me

Just out of reach
Caught in a dream

Not to be found
C'mon reach out reach out
And catch me

Caught in a dream
That you can't get out
C'mon and reach out and catch me

Caught in a dream
That you can't get out of

Lost in a sea
That goes on forever

I wonder if we'll ever be together

Caught in a dream
That you can't get out
C'mon and reach out and catch me

Caught in a dream
That you can't get out
C'mon and reach out reach out reach out reach out
And catch me

// Mal De Mer //

Never moved by my appeal
All my teenage sorrows

I always die behind the wheel
On the coastal highway

I was feeling mal de mer
From all that teenage violence

Voices in the smoggy air
All my teenage sorrows

Now I'm cut up in the plume
With stop see you sideways

Now I'm ribbons in the spoon
And the world is silence

I was feeling mal de mer
All my teenage sorrows
All my teenage sorrows

(Teenage sorrows)

I was feeling mal de mer
All my teenage sorrows

(All my teenage sorrows)
(Teenage sorrows)

// Under The Marigold //

You know I
Actually hardly ever drink this stuff

But funny or not now
I can't seem to get enough

I got nothing 'gainst life
Just sometimes it kills

Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?

'Cause I'm gettin' the chills

You know I always knew
That you would surely understand
After all
I'm just a guy who's living in his van

Maybe in the next life
I'll come back as a disease

Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?

'Cause I'm startin' to freeze

So babe
Would you come down
To the night of the bereft?

First you gotta go right
Then you gotta go left

Parked in the moonlight
Yeah, 'Neath the Marigold

Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?

It's just gettin' so cold

Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?
Will you want me a little?

It's gettin' so cold

(Ooooh!)

It's gettin' so cold

(It's gettin' there!)

// How I Learned To Earn Rewards //

I got a message from Julie
I got my head in the clouds

I asked her if she would screw me
She said "you better start to lookin' for ground"

Dedication
To medication

We regret to inform
We're never satisfied

How I learned to earn rewards
How I learned to please the lords

How I learned to earn rewards
How I learned to please the lords

I never dream when I slumber
I never shoot when I aim

And since you're knowin' my name now baby
Wouldn't you please look at the number

Dedication
To medication

We regret to inform
We're never satisfied

How I learned to earn rewards
How I learned to please the lords

How I learned to earn rewards
How I learned to please the lords

// I Just Can't Break It To You //

I went to your house
I knocked very hard

She won't wake up
I slept in the yard

A German and a Russian
And a Frenchman do their best

The Frenchman had a breakdown
So they gave it all a rest

You took a boat to Indochine
And you partied in Saigon

But they followed him
And they begged to him
That they should carry on

I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't break it to you

I slept at the bar
I'm not feeling fresh

I hear the roar
Of fighter jets

I went to your house
They bulldozed it down

I danced at a barn
But you weren't around

Lying on my back
Little ground has come to feed

I tightened up my necktie
'Lest the brownies make me bleed

I thought of my inheritance
I did receive today

A few drops for my troubles
And a thing for Morgan le Fay

I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't break it to you

I just can't take it
I just can't break it to you
