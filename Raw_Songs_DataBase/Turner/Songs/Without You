Fire, smoke, bad joke
That's what my life's been turned into
Hurt, cry, pray to die
That's all that I've got left to do

Without you, every time someone speaks your name
I feel my heart go up in flames
Without you, nobody's here to see me cry
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes
Without you, I'm the only one that I've got left
And I can't live with myself, without you, oh, without you

Guilt, shame, I'm to blame
For all the pain I put you through
Cold, yeah, stoned, mind blown
There's nothing left for me to lose

Without you, every time someone speaks your name
I feel my heart go up in flames
Without you, nobody's here to see me cry
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes
Without you, I'm the only one that I've got left
And I can't live with myself, without you, oh, without you

Without you, every time someone speaks your name
I feel my heart go up in flames
Without you, nobody's here to see me cry
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes
Without you, I'm the only one that I've got left
And I can't live with myself, without you, oh, without you

Without you, every time someone speaks your name
I feel my heart go up in flames
Without you, nobody's here to see me cry
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes
Without you, I'm the only one that I've got left
And I can't live with myself, without you, oh, without you
