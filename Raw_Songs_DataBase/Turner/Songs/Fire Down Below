Here comes old Johnny and he's looking mighty fine
Here comes old Tommy and he's stepping right on time
There go the street lights bringing on the night
Here come the women's faces shining from the light
All through the shadows they come and they go

We've got only one thing in common
We've got the fire down below

Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine
Here comes the poor man trying to make his money green
Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop
One thing for certain it ain't never going to stop
When it all gets too heavy
That's when they come and go

We've got only one thing in common
We've got the fire down below

It happens out in Vegas, it happens in Moline
On the blue blood streets of Boston
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens
It went on yesterday and it's going on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treating somebody right
And he's looking out for Johnny and he's looking mighty fine
And he's walking the streets for Amy
And he'll find her every time
When the street light flicker bringing on the night
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight
All through the midnight
Watch them come and watch them go

We've got only one thing in common
We've got the fire down below

We've got only one thing in common
We've got the fire down below

We've got only one thing in common
We've got the fire down below

Burning
Keep on burning
Hot!
