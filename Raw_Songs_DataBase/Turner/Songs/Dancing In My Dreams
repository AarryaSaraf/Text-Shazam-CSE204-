I've been running from the truth
I've been running since my youth
Tired of running
I will stand here till you see
I am you and you are me
Tired of running

There really is no difference
When you look beneath the skin
Someday I know we'll go beyond
This world we're living in

Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing....ummmm
Dancing in my dreams

There's no hiding in the dark
From the beating of my heart it's getting louder
Just as long as we believe
The truth will set us free it's getting louder
All that really matters is the light in your face
In you I see the longing of the whole human race

Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Dancing in my dreams

All along the story goes
Or it's the passing of the torch...ummmm
With one small pass it all begins
Then there are millions more, millions more

Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing...ohhhh
Dancing in my dreams
Ohhhh...uhhhh dancing in my dreams
