(What they do! )
Smile in my face
All the time they want to take my place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

I say, they smile in my face
All the time they want to take my place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

Everybody who really have someone
And if you really, really care
Then I'm telling everybody
That you've gotta beware, yeah

Somebody's out to take your baby
And a few of your best friends
They sure look shady
Blades are long, clenched tight in their fist
Aimin' straight at your back
I just don't think they'll miss

(What they do! )
They keep smiling in your face
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

A house fully of visitors
Always around, calling themselves my friends
Oh, they keep coming around
Time and time and time and time again

I know they're trying to take my baby
Even though I'd never home
They just keep on comin'
What can I do to get them on the right track
Oh, I wish they'd take some of these knives off my back

(What they did!) (Do, do)
They keep smiling in my face
All the time they want to take my place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

(What they did!) (Do, do)
They keep smiling in my face
All the time they want to take my place
(Back stabbers)

Talking about Back Stabbers
(Smile in my face all the time)
I know they just wanna take my place
(Back stabbers)

(They just keep smiling in my face)
Two faces, mornin'
They just want to take my place

They Keep smiling
(They keep smiling in my face
All the time they want to take my place)
All the time!
They just wanna take my place...

Ohhh, yeah
