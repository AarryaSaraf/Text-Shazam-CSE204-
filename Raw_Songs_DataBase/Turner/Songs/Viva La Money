Nothing make 'em holla
Like the Almighty Dolla
Jungle hogs are ready, again
If you rich and treat her nice
They get a good price
Over charge the poor
Some more

I'm talking 'bout
Viva la money

Now you buy a cheap thrill
And you can pay a few bills
Even get yourself killed, fact
Now it can fool ya heart
And make 'em think your smart
Tear a friend apart
Too bad, too bad

Viva la money

It can make you feel good
But it you feel bad
It can make you happy
But it can make you sad
It can you do right
But it can make you do wrong
And it'll still be around
When you dead and gone

Viva la money
