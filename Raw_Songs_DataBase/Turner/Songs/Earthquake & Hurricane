Hurricane, hurricane
Hurricane, hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane

The earth cracked open
And was breathing fire
Everybody running
Some was ready to die
Some was going crazy
Some insane
Saying save me
From this hurricane

Hurricane, hurricane
Hurricane, hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane

People started scrambling
They were on the run
They were hit
With an atom bomb
Some lay crippled
Some lay lane
But they saved me
From this hurricane

Hurricane, hurricane
Hurricane, hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane
