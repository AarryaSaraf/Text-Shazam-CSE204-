There's a time for love and a time for healing
Can't go back and undo what's been done
The word about time is revealing
Just how far we've left this kingdom come

Hey hey we're finding our way
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday
Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world...yeah

Kiss of life and the hand of fate
Boy grow's up into his father's son
And he loves to love, been taught to hate
To carry on the way it had been done

All that lasts is destiny and
Maybe someday we can put the cast away
Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world...yeah
Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Put your fear away, find a better way
There's all kinds of people in this world...yeah

Underneath a broken sky
Love can heal when it's sad
In a moment, things can change
One look behind and it's never the same

Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world yeah
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world
Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Put your fear away, find a better way
There's all kinds of people in this world...yeah

Underneath a broken sky
In a moment, things can change....never the same
