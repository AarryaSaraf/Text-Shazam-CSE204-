It was the fourth of July, I was milking the cow
You showed me, yes you taught me how
I was 13, you said I was green
You said you'd pick me when I was ripe

Well now I'm ripe
Baby, I'm ripe and just your type
I'm ripe
Come and pick me tonight

I'm young and alive with big eyes
I'm wild and the only child
I can have my way and that's whenever you say
I'm like clay, you can mold me anyway

'Cause I'm ripe
Baby, I'm ripe and I'm just your type
I'm ripe
Come and pick me tonight

I'm ripe
Baby, I'm ripe and I'm just your type
I'm ripe
So come on and pick me tonight

I know what I want while I'm young
Get a man while I can
Young or old, warm or cold
But he's got to satisfy my soul

I'm ripe
Baby, I'm ripe and just your type
I'm ripe
Come and pick me tonight
