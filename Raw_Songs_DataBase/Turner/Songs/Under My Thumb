Under my thumb
The guy who once had me down
Under my thumb
The guy who once pushed me around
It's down to me
Yes it is
The way he does what he's told
Down to me, the change has come
He's under my thumb
Ain't it the truth babe?
Under my thumb
The squirming worm who's just had his day
Under my thumb
A guy who has just changed his ways
It's down to me, yes it is

The way he speaks when he's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
He's under my thumb

Under my thumb, my thumb
I've got the  in my hand
Under my thumb
I made him the sweetest cat in the world
It's down to me

The way he speaks when he's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
Now he's under my thumb
