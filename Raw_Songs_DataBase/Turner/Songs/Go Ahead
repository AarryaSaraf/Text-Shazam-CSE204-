You see me smile but you paint an ugly face
Everything you do is all about the chase

Don't let them see you cry, don't let them know
You won't lay down and die for their show

Oh ho, why don't you go ahead tear my heart out?
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry?
Go ahead play and your game, go ahead
Spread my name all over your blood red sky

They color your stars 'til the light begins to fade
But never give up 'cause every dog has its day

Don't let them see you cry, don't let them know
You won't lay down and die for their show

Oh ho, why don't you go ahead tear my heart out?
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry?
Go ahead play and your game, go ahead
Spread my name all over your blood red sky

And why don't you go ahead, go ahead, go ahead?
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry?
I said go ahead play your game
I said go ahead play your game
I said go ahead play your game
Your blood red sky

Oh ho, why don't you go ahead tear my heart out?
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry?
Go ahead play and your game, go ahead
Spread my name all over your blood red sky

Oh ho, why don't you go ahead tear my heart out?
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry?
Go ahead play and your game, go ahead
Spread my name all over your blood red sky

Your blood red sky
Blood red sky
