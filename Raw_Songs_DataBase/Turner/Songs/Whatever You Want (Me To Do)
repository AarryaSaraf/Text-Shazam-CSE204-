Whatever you want me to do, I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be, I will be what you need
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sensual
I can't rely on myself, I'm wanting you and no one else
You've got me wrapped up

'Cause time takes what love heals
And deep in my heart I know it's for real

Whatever you want me to do, I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be, I will be what you need
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sensual
And I, I know that it's real

I know you've had flames in your heart
That have torn you apart
I know you've been saved from your own
But together we're strong
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're holding me
I'm feeling passionate
'Cause time takes what love steals
And deep in my heart I know that it's real

Whatever you want me to do, I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be, I will be what you need
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're next to me
I'm feeling sensual

I know, I know that it's real...ooh
Whatever you want me to do....do, do,...ooh
'Cause time takes and love heals
Wherever we are, I know it's for real
I know, I know that it's real

Whatever you want me to do baby, baby, baby
I will do darling, do it for you
Whatever you want me to be..yeah, I will be everything
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sensual
It's time that I'm free of a love that pleases me
Ooh, too easily, easily baby
