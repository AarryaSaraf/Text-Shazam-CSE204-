You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love

I said, oh baby, well now come on baby
I want to be with the one I love
You know you're the one I'm thinking of
I know that night time, oh, is the right time
To be with the one I love

Well I used all my dollar
Dollar and dime away 
Left me alone, a child

I said, oh baby, well now come on baby
I want to be with the one I love
You know you're the one I'm thinking of
I know that night time, oh, is the right time
To be with the one I love

Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby!
You know I love you
No one above you
Holy child, make everything alright?

You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love

So squeeze me
So squeeze me
So squeeze me
Lead me, oh baby
Take my hand
Hug me, no other way 

You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love

Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby!
You know I love you
No one above you
Holy child, make everything alright?

I said, oh baby, well now come on baby
I want to be with the one I love
You know you're the one I'm thinking of
I know that night time, oh, is the right time
To be with the one I love

Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby!
You know I love you
No one above you
Holy child, make everything alright?

You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love
