Come back to me
Don't believe me this way
I've been begging
You'd come back and stay
Said give me what you want
Anything
It's all right
Baby, I can take a little pain, babe
I can take pain

Said, I know what you want
Don't explain
That's all right
Baby, I can take a little pain, babe
I can take pain

I've heard what you've done
Oh, your lover girlfriends
I won't compete with 'em
No, no, I won't complain
Just give me what you want
Anything
It's all right
Baby, I can take a little pain, babe
I can take pain

You just give me what you want
And don't explain
It's all right
Baby, I can take a little...
Anything
I know what you want
Don't explain
It's all right
Baby, I...
I can take pain
Oh, give it to me
I said give it to me

Any woman can take a little pain
Just got to know the right man
