I get up in the morning
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the evening
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Oh, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby
I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
And radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my face, my hair
I'm going like to nowhere
But I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
When the jokes running wild, but it's on me
I'll rattle the world off my shoulders
Come on baby the laugh's on me

Coming on the streets of this town
And they know they keep me up all night
They say you gotta stay hungry (Say what?)
Hey baby I'm just about starving today

I'm dying for action
Kinda sick of sitting around here trying to write
This book
Something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying
Over a broken heart
This gun's for hire

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark...
