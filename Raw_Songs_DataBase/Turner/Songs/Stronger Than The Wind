You think you've done it all but I'd like to make a bet
There's so much more up ahead, you ain't seen nothing yet
It's gonna take a little time before the rain dies down
Till the storm is over, over... you've got to stand your ground

You've got to be stronger than the wind, got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind

You know it could be worse, at least you're not alone
There's a million billion souls who haven't even got a home
They haven't any bills to pay and no letters to send
They just wait for judgement day, at least you got a friend

Come on and be stronger than the wind, got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind

A tree stays rooted but a tree knows how to bend

Let the thunder and lightning flash above you
Right here on earth you got me to love you
You've got me to love you

It's gonna take a little time before the rain dies down
Till the storm is over, over... you've got to stand your ground

You've got to be stronger than the wind, got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind, got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind
Stronger than the wind, you've got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind, you've got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind
