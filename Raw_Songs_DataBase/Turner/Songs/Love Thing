Saw you there so confused
I know that I could make my move now
Treading softly I walked over to you
We talked about this thing called love
Saw your eyes open wide
And I knew your heart was in it
Let me take you there
Let me take you there tonight

Get on board get on my love thing
Let me drive you wild
Let me show you I wanna hear you sing
So get on my love thing right now

Close your eyes follow me
I'll show you a world you've never been to
Take a ride in my love machine
And I won't do anything you can't get into
What I got is what you need
And you won't do a thing about it
Let me take you there
Let me take you there tonight

Get on board get on my love thing
Let me drive you wild
Let me show you I wanna hear you sing
So get on my love thing right now

I never want you to go
I always want you to stay
So come on baby come on now come on now come on
Saw your eyes open wide
And I knew your heart was in it
Let me take you there
Let me take you there tonight

Get on board get on my love thing
Let me drive you wild
Let me show you I wanna hear you sing
So get on my love thing right now
