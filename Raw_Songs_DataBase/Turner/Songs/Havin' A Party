We're havin' a party
Everybody's swingin'
Dancin' to the music on the radio
Champagne is in the icebox
And the popcorn's on the table
And me and my baby
Are out here on the floor

So listen, Mister DJ
Keep those records playin'
'Cause I'm a-havin' such a good time
'Cause I'm dancin' with my baby

And everybody's swingin'
Jackie's doin' that "twist" now
If you'll take requests
Then I've got a few for you
Play that song called "Soul Twist"
And what about that one fellow I knew
And don't forget "The Mashed Potato"
No other song will do

Yeah listen, Mr. DJ
Just keep those records playin'
'Cause I'm a-havin' such a good time
Dancin' with my baby

We're havin' a party
Everybody's swingin'
Dancin' to the music
On the radio

Havin' a party
Everybody's swingin'
Dancin' to the music
On the radio

Well one more time

We're havin' a party (havin' a party)
Everybody's swingin' (everybody's swingin')
Dancin' to the music (dancin' to the music)
On the radio (on the radio)

Champagne's in the icebox (havin' a party)
Popcorn's on the table (everybody's swingin')
Me and my baby (dancin' to the music)
Out here on the floor (on the radio)

Oh now everybody

Everybody's swingin' (everybody's swingin')
Dancin' to the music (dancin' to the music)
On the radio (on the radio)

We're havin' a party (havin' a party)
Everybody's swingin' (everybody's swingin')
Dancin' to the music (dancin' to the music)
On the radio (on the radio)
