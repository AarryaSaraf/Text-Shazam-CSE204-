Dangles of dust itching for the last
Goes around, dum, dum
Shadows go out, streets come alive
Shake some phone for relight it on

And I check in someone I thought
Someone the same I give you hand
Then I'll be waiting, showing no game
But here's no prey, should be

Fruits of the night
Got hard it slow when it's not
I got my fruits of the night
Oh, that's get so dumb
So romantic

Wicked princess wanna the best
All dressed down to get up the prince
And I'm becoming smile, running wild
Hey, don't you know
You got caught it, yeah, yeah

And I'll beware you wanna that
And she wanna sale, I give you hand
And I check in showing no game
Where ain't flame there's just stop here

Fruits of the night
Got hard it slow when it's not
I got my fruits of the night
Oh, that's get so dumb
So romantic

Ooh, what you need that special key
You're so weird down on your knees
Going for this, dying for that
But that's just normal cigarette

Fruits of the night
Got hard it slow but it's not
Fruits of the night
Just a photo
So romantic

Fruits of the night
I got my fruits of the night, yeah
Fruits of the night
Got my fruits of the night, yeah

Do, do, do, yeah

Fruits of the night
I got my fruits of the night, yeah
Fruits of the night
Got my fruits of the night, yeah

Do, do do do do, do do do, do
Do, do do do do, do do do, do
Do, do do do do, do do do, do
Do, do do do do do do do do, wow
Yeah
Do, do do do do, do do do, do
Do, do do do do, do do do, do

Fruits of the night
Got my fruits of the night
