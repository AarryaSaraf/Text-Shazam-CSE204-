Who's that knockin' on my door?
It's gotta be a quarter to four
Is it you again, comin' back for more?
Say, you can love me tonight as you want
But in the morning you'll regret if you don't

I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, I'm wearin' you out
Hot legs, make you scream and shout
Hot legs, send you back to school?
I love you, honey

You've got a persuasive tongue
You've been talking to me all night long
But what you don't understand, you gotta be a man
You gonna need a shot of vitamin E
By the time you're finished with me

I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, I'm wearin' you out
Hot legs, make you scream and shout
Hot legs, send you back to school?
I love you, honey

I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, I'm an alley cat
Hot legs, I know what I've said
Hot legs, send you back to school?
I love you, honey

Get yourself some confidence
A little bit of common sense
I've got my master degree
Say, are you ready for me?

I've got legs up to my neck
I'm gonna make you a physical wreck
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, I'm wearin' you out
Hot legs, make you scream and shout
Hot legs, send you back to school?
I love you, honey

Hot legs, I'm an alley cat
Hot legs, I know what I've said
Hot legs, send you back to school?
I love you, honey
