Can't you see, this is me, I'm
Can't you see, this is me, I'm

Don't walk crowded streets
Choose every dream from a magazine stand
I don't buy into that
All day TV shows
Sell their souls just to make living easy
I don't buy into that
I don't need satin and lace no no no
I'll bring a smile to your face

I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake
I've never been a winner but I still play the game
Can't you see that this is me
I'm all the woman that I want to be

Can't you see, this is me, I'm a woman
Can't you see, this is me, I'm

Good times can't get enough
Life can be tough but it's all for a reason
I sure buy into that
Life goes around and around
We seek what we found 'cause it's all an illusion
I sure buy into that
I know the waters of fate
Will keep on flowing my way

I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake no no
I've never been a winner but I still play the game
Baby can't you see this is me
I'm all the woman that I want
I've never been afraid of myself
I don't buy into that I don't buy into that
I don't wanna be nobody else I don't buy into that I don't buy into that I don't buy into that

I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame be the flame
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake oh no no no
I've never been a winner but I still play the game
Baby baby can't you see that this is me I'm all the woman that I want all I wanna be
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame be the flame
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake oh no no no
I've never been a winner but I still play the game
Can't you see this is me
And I'm all the woman that I wanna be
