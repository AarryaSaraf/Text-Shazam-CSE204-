// Under My Thumb //

Under my thumb
The guy who once had me down
Under my thumb
The guy who once pushed me around
It's down to me
Yes it is
The way he does what he's told
Down to me, the change has come
He's under my thumb
Ain't it the truth babe?
Under my thumb
The squirming worm who's just had his day
Under my thumb
A guy who has just changed his ways
It's down to me, yes it is

The way he speaks when he's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
He's under my thumb

Under my thumb, my thumb
I've got the [?] in my hand
Under my thumb
I made him the sweetest cat in the world
It's down to me

The way he speaks when he's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
Now he's under my thumb

// Let's Spend The Night Together //

My, my, my, my
Don't you worry 'bout what's on your mind (Oh my)
I'm in no hurry I can take my time (Oh my)
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tied (tongues's getting tied)
I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm high, but I try, try, try (Oh my)

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
I feel so strong that I can't disguise (oh my)
Let's spend the night together
But I just can't apologize (oh no)
Let's spend the night together

Don't hang me up just to let me down (don't let me down)
We could have fun just groovin' around around and around
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
You know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
Now I need you more than ever

Let's spend the night together
Let's spend the night together now
This doesn't happen to me everyday (oh my)
Let's spend the night together
No excuses offered anyway (oh my)
Let's spend the night together
I'll satisfy your every need (every need)

And I now know you will satisfy me
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

// Acid Queen //

If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl will put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night

I'm the gypsy, the acid queen
Pay me before I start
I'm the gypsy and I'm guaranteed
To mend his aching heart

Give us a room, close the door
Leave us for a while
You won't be a boy no more
Young, but not a child

I'm the gypsy, the acid queen
Pay me before I start
I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart


Gather your wits and hold them fast
Your mind must learn to roam
Just as the gypsy queen must do
You're gonna hit the road

My work's been done, now look at him
He's never been more alive
His head it shakes, his fingers clutch
Watch his body writhe

I'm the gypsy, the acid queen
Pay me before I start
I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed
To break your little heart

If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl will put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one more night

I'm the gypsy, the acid queen
Pay me before I start
I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart

// I Can See For Miles //

I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have 'cause there's magic in my eyes

I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

If you think that I don't know about the little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately you put things in my way

Well, here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

You took advantage of my trust in you when I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys and now you've got the nerve to say

That you still want me
Well, that's as may be
But you gotta stand trial
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have 'cause there's magic in my eyes

I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball to see right through the haze

Well, here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles and miles

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles

// Bootsy Whitelaw //

Mama died when I was born
So all I ever knew was my mom
I tell you that I, I never ever went to school
My mama told me all about street rules
Mama told me everything about
Not about Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw

He was tall, big and tan
I tell you he was a hell of a good looking thing
Between his eyes he had two frown
He never laugh or play around
Mama told me everything about
But not about Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw

Bop along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw
Bop along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw
Mama told me everything about
But not about Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw

He lived way up across town
Women love him, bop around
Ooh, I loved him right from the start
I didn't even care if he broke my heart
Mama told me everything about
But not about Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw

Sing along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw
Sing along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw
Mama told me everything about
But not about Bootsey Whitelaw

I beg and pose along
'Cause I want him more this time
Nobody promised me all along
He told me that he could never be bad along
And so I smiled mama, what can I do?
Well, she told me she love Mr. Bootsey too

Bop along, bop along, all along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw
Bop along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw
Mama told me everything about
But not about Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw

[?], bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw
Bop along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw
Mama told me everything
But not about Bootsey Whitelaw

// Pick Me Tonight //

It was the fourth of July, I was milking the cow
You showed me, yes you taught me how
I was 13, you said I was green
You said you'd pick me when I was ripe

Well now I'm ripe
Baby, I'm ripe and just your type
I'm ripe
Come and pick me tonight

I'm young and alive with big eyes
I'm wild and the only child
I can have my way and that's whenever you say
I'm like clay, you can mold me anyway

'Cause I'm ripe
Baby, I'm ripe and I'm just your type
I'm ripe
Come and pick me tonight

I'm ripe
Baby, I'm ripe and I'm just your type
I'm ripe
So come on and pick me tonight

I know what I want while I'm young
Get a man while I can
Young or old, warm or cold
But he's got to satisfy my soul

I'm ripe
Baby, I'm ripe and just your type
I'm ripe
Come and pick me tonight

// Rockin' And Rollin' //

He's got money
He's got lovin'
But there's you that's got a hold on me
And I'm rockin' and rollin', rollin'

He wears [?]
And he [?]
But there's you that's got a hold on me
I can't stop rockin' and rollin', rollin'

Rockin' and rollin'
Steppin' and strollin'
It's you that's got a hold on me
And I'm rockin' and rollin', rollin'

I got a fever
It's about 102
But there's you that's got a hold on me
And I'm rockin' and rollin', rollin'

I got rhythm
I'm gonna give it to you
'Cause there's just you that's got a hold on me
It's got me rockin' and rollin', rollin'

Rockin' and rollin'
Steppin' and strollin'
It's you that's got a hold on me
And I'm rockin' and rollin', rollin'

Rockin' and rollin'
Steppin' and strollin'
It's you that's got a hold on me
And I'm rockin' and rollin', rollin'
