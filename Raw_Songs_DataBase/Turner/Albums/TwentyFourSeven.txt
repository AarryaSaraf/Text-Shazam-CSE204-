// Whatever You Need //

In what other lives have I known your kiss
And what forgotten moments have I felt like this?
The way you touch me I come undone
You know me more than anyone
Whatever you want
In what other lives have I touched your face
And what words did we whisper in a strange forbidden place?
To be with you, baby, is to find myself
We're two of a kind, you and I
I couldn't love anyone else

You are my beginning, my end
You are my lover, my friend
In this life in this time?

Whatever you want, whatever you need
I will be right here waiting, baby, baby, baby
Whatever you want, whatever you need
I will be right here waiting, yeah, yeah, yeah

In what other lives did I feel your skin
And when exactly did I breathe you in?
Feel like I've known you for a thousand years
You're so familiar to me and there is no fear

You are my beginning, my end
You are my lover, my friend
In this life in this time?

Whatever you want, whatever you need
I will be right here waiting, baby, baby, baby
Whatever you want, whatever you need
I will be right here waiting, yeah, yeah, yeah

Watch the sun go down, yeah, yeah
My past and future in you are bound, oh, yeah
I watch as time moves on, I'm alive and strong
And when I'm with you there's no right, no wrong

Whatever you want, whatever you need
I will be right here waiting, baby, baby, baby
Whatever you want, whatever you need
I will be right here, right here waiting, waiting, baby
Whatever you want, whatever you need
I will be right here waiting, baby, baby, baby
Whatever you want, whatever you need
I will be right here waiting, yeah, yeah, yeah

Right here, right here waiting
Right here, right here waiting

// All The Woman //

Can't you see, this is me, I'm
Can't you see, this is me, I'm

Don't walk crowded streets
Choose every dream from a magazine stand
I don't buy into that
All day TV shows
Sell their souls just to make living easy
I don't buy into that
I don't need satin and lace no no no
I'll bring a smile to your face

I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake
I've never been a winner but I still play the game
Can't you see that this is me
I'm all the woman that I want to be

Can't you see, this is me, I'm a woman
Can't you see, this is me, I'm

Good times can't get enough
Life can be tough but it's all for a reason
I sure buy into that
Life goes around and around
We seek what we found 'cause it's all an illusion
I sure buy into that
I know the waters of fate
Will keep on flowing my way

I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake no no
I've never been a winner but I still play the game
Baby can't you see this is me
I'm all the woman that I want
I've never been afraid of myself
I don't buy into that I don't buy into that
I don't wanna be nobody else I don't buy into that I don't buy into that I don't buy into that

I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame be the flame
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake oh no no no
I've never been a winner but I still play the game
Baby baby can't you see that this is me I'm all the woman that I want all I wanna be
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame be the flame
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake oh no no no
I've never been a winner but I still play the game
Can't you see this is me
And I'm all the woman that I wanna be

// When The Heartache Is Over //

Once in a lifetime you find
Someone to show you the way
Someone to make your decisions
But I let you lead me astray

Who did you think you were fooling
Said you were missing me blind
But the truth is I knew you were lying
You were using me time after time

When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you (Missing you)
Won't look over my shoulder
'Cause I know that I can live without you
Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you

Time to move on with my life now
Leaving the past all behind
I can make my own decisions
It was only a matter of time
Sometimes I look back in anger
Thinking about all the pain
But I know that I'm stronger without you
And that I'll never need you again

When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you (Missing you)
Won't look over my shoulder
'Cause I know that I can live without you
Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you

When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you (Missing you)
Won't look over my shoulder
'Cause I know that I can live without you
Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you

When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you (Missing you)
Won't look over my shoulder
'Cause I know that I can live without you
Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you

Live without you
I can live without you
I can live without you

// Absolutely Nothing's Changed //

Absolutely nothing's changed
This is my heart talking
It's time to face reality
This spell I'm under can't last much longer
Any fool can see
You come here with your promises
But I remember all the lies
I bought the laughter happy ever after
How could I be so blind so blind

'Cause absolutely nothing's changed
You play with my emotions
I'll live to fight another day
I m bruised but I ain't broken I ain't broken

Now you say you're sorry
For everything you put me through
You wanna make up I just gotta wake up
It's the same old you
The same old you

'Cause absolutely nothing's changed
You play with my emotions
I'll live to fight another day
I'm bruised but I ain't broken ain't broken

Ooh I've been dreaming but it's over now bad dreams are over now
I'm gonna rise up rise above all the troubles and tears I'm down but I ain't out
Play with my emotions I maybe bruised I ain't broken
'Cause absolutely nothing's changed
At last my eyes are open
I'm gonna live to fight another day
I maybe bruised but I ain't broken ain't broken
'Cause absolutely nothing's changed
Absolutely nothing
I'll live to fight another day
I maybe bruised but I ain't broken
'Cause absolutely nothing's changed
Absolutely nothing
I'm gonna live to fight another day I maybe bruised but I ain't broken
'Cause absolutely nothing's changed

// Talk To My Heart //

I found a friend, someone to help me
And a place I can be myself when I'm in trouble now
And I've lost it and I don't know how
I come to you 'cause you can show me
Get me back to the me I know with a remedy
Baby I need your therapy
With your healing kiss you know how to make my mind relax
I will listen to the words you say and just lie back

Talk to my heart that's where real talking starts
Words of love that cut straight to my heart
Oh reach out and touch, so few words say so much
I can hear you when you tell it like it is
When you talk straight to my heart

I guess it shows I need attention
Somehow you're asking all the right questions that I've got to say
What's been on my mind these days
And I know you know just how to make my mind react
When it's coming straight from you that's my first point of contact

Talk to my heart that's where real talking starts
Words of love that cut straight to my heart
Oh reach out and touch, so few words say so much
I can hear you when you tell it like it is
When you talk straight to my heart

I'm bad at making decisions
But being alone with you just feels so right, feels so right
I'm losing my inhibitions
With every minute I share with you tonight, share it with you tonight, oh

Talk, talk to me
To my heart, to my heart, oh yeah
Come one, come on and reach out
'Cause the words just mean so much
I can hear you
When you talk right to my heart

Talk to my heart that's where real talking starts
Words of love that cut straight to my heart
Oh reach out and touch, so few words say so much
I can hear you when you tell it like it is
When you talk straight to my heart

I can hear you, I can hear you
I can hear you, I can hear you
I can hear you, I can hear you

// Don't Leave Me This Way //

All of my life, all of my life
I've been searching for a love like ours
Somewhere to stay, somewhere safe
In your arms, I was so sure

Are you really saying your heart's changing
Do you really mean goodbye

Don't leave me this way, no, no
Don't tell me it's over
We've only begun and our love is so young
You're leading me nowhere
Don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me this way 

Say what's on your mind, one thing at a time
And I promise you we'll talk it through
Don't walk away, there's so much more to say
Though my words seem lost on you
Can't believe you're talking like we're just friends
Can't you see the tears I cry?

Don't leave me this way, no, no
Don't tell me it's over
We've only begun and our love is so young
You're leading me nowhere
Don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me this way 

Are you really saying your heart's changing
Do you really mean goodbye

Don't leave me this way, no, no
Don't tell me it's over
We've only begun and our love is so young
You're leading me nowhere
Don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me this way 

Don't leave me this way, no, no
Don't tell me it's over
We've only begun and our love is so young
You're leading me nowhere
Don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me this way 

Don't leave me, don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way 

Don't leave me this way, no, no
Don't tell me it's over
We've only begun and our love is so young
You're leading me nowhere
Don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me this way

// Go Ahead //

You see me smile but you paint an ugly face
Everything you do is all about the chase

Don't let them see you cry, don't let them know
You won't lay down and die for their show

Oh ho, why don't you go ahead tear my heart out?
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry?
Go ahead play and your game, go ahead
Spread my name all over your blood red sky

They color your stars 'til the light begins to fade
But never give up 'cause every dog has its day

Don't let them see you cry, don't let them know
You won't lay down and die for their show

Oh ho, why don't you go ahead tear my heart out?
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry?
Go ahead play and your game, go ahead
Spread my name all over your blood red sky

And why don't you go ahead, go ahead, go ahead?
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry?
I said go ahead play your game
I said go ahead play your game
I said go ahead play your game
Your blood red sky

Oh ho, why don't you go ahead tear my heart out?
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry?
Go ahead play and your game, go ahead
Spread my name all over your blood red sky

Oh ho, why don't you go ahead tear my heart out?
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry?
Go ahead play and your game, go ahead
Spread my name all over your blood red sky

Your blood red sky
Blood red sky

// Without You //

Fire, smoke, bad joke
That's what my life's been turned into
Hurt, cry, pray to die
That's all that I've got left to do

Without you, every time someone speaks your name
I feel my heart go up in flames
Without you, nobody's here to see me cry
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes
Without you, I'm the only one that I've got left
And I can't live with myself, without you, oh, without you

Guilt, shame, I'm to blame
For all the pain I put you through
Cold, yeah, stoned, mind blown
There's nothing left for me to lose

Without you, every time someone speaks your name
I feel my heart go up in flames
Without you, nobody's here to see me cry
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes
Without you, I'm the only one that I've got left
And I can't live with myself, without you, oh, without you

Without you, every time someone speaks your name
I feel my heart go up in flames
Without you, nobody's here to see me cry
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes
Without you, I'm the only one that I've got left
And I can't live with myself, without you, oh, without you

Without you, every time someone speaks your name
I feel my heart go up in flames
Without you, nobody's here to see me cry
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes
Without you, I'm the only one that I've got left
And I can't live with myself, without you, oh, without you

// Falling //

Falling
Help me, I'm falling
Helplessly falling
Falling for you
And mountains
There may be mountains
The highest mountain
Won't keep me from you, oh yeah

For you, I'd swim across an ocean wide
Just to be with you, I'd even dare to fly
It's the miracle that happens every time
I fall for you, oh yeah!
And forever and forever without end
I just keep

Falling
Needing and wanting
The only one thing
And all I want is you, oh yeah

For you, I'd swim across an ocean wide
Just to be with you, I'd even dare to fly
It's the miracle that happens every time
I fall for you, oh yeah!
And forever and forever without end
I just keep

For you, I'd swim across an ocean wide
Just to be with you, I'd even dare to fly
It's the miracle that happens every time
I fall for you, oh yeah!
And forever and forever without end
I just keep

I fall for you

// I Will Be There //

This is the life you saved, laid out before you
Everything that I think I have been and what I am now
Nothing can change the way I feel about you, no
Better we go on our separate ways
Nothing is left but the endless days
Nothing to cry but your name

Don't you look back, don't say a word
I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you
Don't you despair, I will be there for you, I will be there

Maybe this time next year we'll be together
You can wipe away all of the tears, bring truth to the lies
There was a silent dream, we made a promise
We'd be there for each other forever
Aboard like a ship on an ocean's roar
Beating a path to your open door, nothing will keep me away

Don't you look back, don't say a word
I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you
Don't you despair, I will be there for you, I will be there

Each night I pray to God above
You will be waiting for me, you will be lonely for me
Don't you despair, I will be there for you
I will be there, oh, I will be there

Don't you look back, don't say a word
I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you
Don't you despair, I will be there for you, I will be there

Each night I pray to God above
You will be waiting for me, you will be lonely for me
Don't you despair, I will be there for you
I will be there, oh, I will be there

Oh I, I will be there until the end, hmm
Oh yeah, I will be there, hmm, I will be there
Oh, I will be there, I will be there

// Twenty Four Seven //

Some folks say there's a price on love
Watch your freedom go, watch your freedom go
Just can't breathe when you're 'Hand in Glove'
Watch your freedom go, baby I don't know
But how can they mean it?
How come they give it up?
How long until they see
The modern laws of lovin' don't apply to me

Twenty four seven, stay here with me
Twenty four seven, throw away the key
Twenty four seven, I don't wanna be free

You get by if you kiss and tell
Hear the people say, hear the people say
Two strong hearts gotta share one cell
Hear the people say, but it ain't my way
How can they mean it?
How come they add it up?
I'll give my heart and my soul
If loving you is prison I don't need parole

Twenty four seven, stay here with me
Twenty four seven, throw away the key
Twenty four seven, I don't wanna be free

Twenty four seven, stay here with me
Twenty four seven, throw away the key
Twenty four seven, I don't wanna be free, free, free
Twenty four seven, around the clock
Twenty four seven, I never want it to stop
Twenty four seven, mmm, here with me

I'm gonna count the time
That you're gonna be mine
Seven days a week
Twenty four hours ain't enough for me

How can they mean it?
How come they add it up?
I'm gonna give my heart and my soul
If loving you is prison I don't need parole

Twenty four seven, stay here with me
Twenty four seven, throw away the key
Twenty four seven, I don't wanna be free
