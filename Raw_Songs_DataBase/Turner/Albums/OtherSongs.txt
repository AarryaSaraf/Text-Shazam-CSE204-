// Crazy In The Night //

Somewhere out in the galaxy
A number's up but not for me
There's a light inside the window
And the curtain's coming down
Pig is on the spit, and turning round

Going crazy in the night
Crazy in the night

Dropped in from Munich with a master plan
Guess he left his wife and kids at home
He's got so much money rollin'
From the crimes he'll commit
But the Siamese cats are gonna take a little bit

Going crazy in the night
Crazy in the night
Will I turn and run, or do I stand and face the gun?
Going crazy in the night
Everybody seemed to've lost their way
Crazy in the night
Seems there's no way outta here
Do I turn and run?
No!

Got no hands, but I've got my head
I've come so far from the temple
Maybe this is Babylon, or maybe it's a dream
If it weren't so beautiful, it would be obscene
Drinking with the panthers, dancing for their life
God, this place is hungry
Come and see the players, but don't stay for the show
The cats are out tonight, hungry for their rites

Going crazy in the night
Crazy in the night
Will I turn and run, or do I stand and face the gun?
Going crazy in the night
Everybody seemed to've lost their way
Crazy in the night
Seems there's no way outta here
Do I turn and run?
No!

Got no hands, but I've got my head
I've come so far from the temple
Maybe this is Babylon, or maybe its a dream
If it weren't so beautiful...

// Dancing In The Dark //

I get up in the morning
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the evening
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Oh, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby
I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
And radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my face, my hair
I'm going like to nowhere
But I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
When the jokes running wild, but it's on me
I'll rattle the world off my shoulders
Come on baby the laugh's on me

Coming on the streets of this town
And they know they keep me up all night
They say you gotta stay hungry (Say what?)
Hey baby I'm just about starving today

I'm dying for action
Kinda sick of sitting around here trying to write
This book
Something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying
Over a broken heart
This gun's for hire

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark...

// Givin' It Up For Your Love //

I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
Givin' it up for your love
Right now
I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
I'm givin' it up for your love
Right now

My heart is aching for you
I can't stand it
I need your lovin'
And my soul demands it

I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
I'm givin' it up for your love
Right now
Don't you know I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
I'm givin' it up for your love
Right now

I thought about it
And I ain't playing
Won't you listen to me
Every word I'm saying
Hot is cold honey, and cold is hot
And I'm a little mixed up
But I give it everything I've got

I want your money, baby
I want your car
I say I'm doing all right
Doing all right so far

I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
I'm givin' it up for your love
Right now
Don't you know I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
Givin' it up for your love
Right now

I know you told me
That you love me
And I believe that is true
Well I saved the best and I'm grateful
My love only just for you
I said come back here, come back real quick
My heart is aching
And my body's feeling weak
I'll be alright
I said, baby I'll be OK
Come on now, honey
Listen to what I say

I want your money, baby
I want your car
I say I'm doing all right
Doing all right so far

Givin' it up for your love
Everything
Givin' it up for your love
Right now
Don't you know I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
Givin' it up for your love
Right

// Hot Legs //

Who's that knockin' on my door?
It's gotta be a quarter to four
Is it you again, comin' back for more?
Say, you can love me tonight as you want
But in the morning you'll regret if you don't

I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, I'm wearin' you out
Hot legs, make you scream and shout
Hot legs, send you back to school?
I love you, honey

You've got a persuasive tongue
You've been talking to me all night long
But what you don't understand, you gotta be a man
You gonna need a shot of vitamin E
By the time you're finished with me

I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, I'm wearin' you out
Hot legs, make you scream and shout
Hot legs, send you back to school?
I love you, honey

I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, I'm an alley cat
Hot legs, I know what I've said
Hot legs, send you back to school?
I love you, honey

Get yourself some confidence
A little bit of common sense
I've got my master degree
Say, are you ready for me?

I've got legs up to my neck
I'm gonna make you a physical wreck
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, I'm wearin' you out
Hot legs, make you scream and shout
Hot legs, send you back to school?
I love you, honey

Hot legs, I'm an alley cat
Hot legs, I know what I've said
Hot legs, send you back to school?
I love you, honey

// Jumping Jack Flash //

I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
And I howled at my mom in the drivin' rain
But it's all right, oh yeah
In fact, it's a gas!
But it's all right
Said Jumpin' Jack
Gas! Gas! Gas!

I was raised by a toothless, skinny hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right, oh yeah
In fact, it's a gas!
But it's all right
Said Jumpin' Jack
Gas! Gas! Gas!

I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it
Said I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it
I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it, yes, I do

I like it, I said I like it, ooh, I like it, I said I like it
Ooh, I like it, ooh yeah, I like it, I said I like it, ooh yeah, I like it

I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it
I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it
I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it, yes, I do
I like it, like it, yes, I do
I like it, like it, yes, I do

// Kill His Wife (Foolish Behavior) //

Can I introduce myself
I'm a girl of financial wealth
Sound in mind, body, soul and health
And I wanna kill his wife
I have this urge to take a life

Took twenty-four years to get rid of her
Not divorce I really do mean to kill her
She's so full of useless information and trivia
That's why I wanna kill his wife
I really wanna take a life

He'll escape down into Mexico
(Baby, to Mexico)
Sell the house and find a nice young girl
(Find a nice young girl)
Just so life won't hurt no more

Her stupid friends get right up my nose
They wear annoyingly sensible clothes
They're also bleeding grandiose
You know I what, I should kill her friends
They're all driving Mercedes Benz

Should I strangle her in bed
Suffocate that little venomous head
Or shall I hang her up, leave her for death
Do me a favor, kill his wife

Do it mankind to change her life
Should I act quiet, cold and deliberate
Or maybe blow out her brain with a bullet
And they'll say suicide they won't know who done it
And I wanna kill his wife
I really wanna take a life

He'll escape down into Mexico
(Baby, to Mexico)
Sell the house and find a nice young girl
(Find a nice young girl)
Just so life won't hurt no more

The moment of truth has come
I'm at the point of no return
I've got my hands wrapped round the noose
And I'm about to kill his wife
Don't stop me now I'm gonna kill his wife
Too late now I'm gonna kill his wife
Can't help myself I'm gonna take her life

He'll escape down into Mexico
(Baby, to Mexico)
Sell the house and find a nice young girl
(Find a nice young girl)
Just so life won't hurt no more

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

// Stronger Than The Wind //

You think you've done it all but I'd like to make a bet
There's so much more up ahead, you ain't seen nothing yet
It's gonna take a little time before the rain dies down
Till the storm is over, over... you've got to stand your ground

You've got to be stronger than the wind, got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind

You know it could be worse, at least you're not alone
There's a million billion souls who haven't even got a home
They haven't any bills to pay and no letters to send
They just wait for judgement day, at least you got a friend

Come on and be stronger than the wind, got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind

A tree stays rooted but a tree knows how to bend

Let the thunder and lightning flash above you
Right here on earth you got me to love you
You've got me to love you

It's gonna take a little time before the rain dies down
Till the storm is over, over... you've got to stand your ground

You've got to be stronger than the wind, got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind, got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind
Stronger than the wind, you've got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind, you've got to be stronger
Stronger than the wind, it's gonna take a little longer
Stronger than the wind

// Take A Little Pain //

Come back to me
Don't believe me this way
I've been begging
You'd come back and stay
Said give me what you want
Anything
It's all right
Baby, I can take a little pain, babe
I can take pain

Said, I know what you want
Don't explain
That's all right
Baby, I can take a little pain, babe
I can take pain

I've heard what you've done
Oh, your lover girlfriends
I won't compete with 'em
No, no, I won't complain
Just give me what you want
Anything
It's all right
Baby, I can take a little pain, babe
I can take pain

You just give me what you want
And don't explain
It's all right
Baby, I can take a little...
Anything
I know what you want
Don't explain
It's all right
Baby, I...
I can take pain
Oh, give it to me
I said give it to me

Any woman can take a little pain
Just got to know the right man
