// You Know Who (Is Doing You Know What) //

I heard some news this morning
And it almost devastated me
It hit my heart without a warning
The story is on the street
I overheard a conversation it was all about you
I can't believe what they're saying baby, it better not be true

They say you know who is doing you know what
How am I supposed to feel
You know who is doing you know what
I thought our love was real

They say you can't believe everything you hear
But you've got me feeling insecure
I thought you and I had a good thing going
Now baby I'm not so sure
I'm gonna have mixed emotions when I see you tonight
I'm afraid I see the true story when I look in your eyes

They say you know who is doing you know what
Baby I've got to know
You know who is doing you know what
I don't wanna let you go

I don't wanna be jumping to conclusions 
I would rather keep my trust in you
Is your love for me just an illusion?
Baby, tell me is it true?

You know who is doing you know what
I've got to keep my courage up
You know who is doing you know what
Are you gonna turn your back on love?

You know who is doing you know what 
You know who is doing you know what 
You know who is doing you know what 
You know who is doing you know what 
You know who is doing you know what 
You know who is doing you know what

// Undercover Agent For The Blues //

He was my lover, he was working undercover
Fella knew all of the moves
He really had me romping, we were bare foot stomping
He just kept igniting my fuse

He was blinded by the blackness of my long silk stockings
He was rocking with an optical illusion
And this ain't how I thought it'd be
He just kept on keeping me in a state of total confusion

He took me for a ride rattled me down to my shoes
But I found out he was an undercover agent for the blues, yeah

He never really needed love from any direction, no
I was just an innocent bystander
He just kept getting kinkier, hook, line and sinker
Ju-ju-just too hot to handle

He took me by storm, must have been a season for the fools
So bad, he was an undercover agent for the blues

He took me for a ride rattled me down to my shoes
But I found out he was an undercover agent for the blues, yeah

He never really needed love from any direction, no
I was just an innocent bystander
He just kept getting kinkier, hook, line and sinker
Ju-ju-just too hot to handle

He was blinded by the blackness of my long silk stockings
He was rocking with an optical illusion
And this ain't how I thought it'd be
He just kept on keeping me in a state of total confusion

He took me for a ride rattled me down to my shoes
But I found out he was an undercover agent for the blues, yeah

He took me for a ride rattled me down to my shoes
But I found out he was an undercover agent for the blues, yeah

For the blues
For the blues
Undercover agent
Undercover for the blues
For the blues
Undercover agent

// Look Me In The Heart //

Last night we tried to touch
But we never got close
Last night we tried to talk
The words got caught in our throats
When we finally fell asleep
We couldn't have been further apart

Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby, look me in the heart
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you, baby
And it's not in my mind
Can't you look me in the heart?
Look me in the heart

You try to say that I'm hiding from you
You act like a spy, always looking for clues
You've read about my past
But why don't we try to make a new start?

Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby, look me in the heart
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you, baby
And it's not in my mind
Can't you look me in the heart?
Look me in the heart

I remember how good we used to be together
I can remember, baby
So be tender, baby
Remember the love
We said would last forever
I know we can make it like that again

Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby, look me in the heart
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you, baby
And it's not in my mind
Can't you look me in the heart?
Look me, look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby, look me in the heart
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you, baby
And it's not in my mind
Can't you look me in the heart?
Look me in the heart
Look me in my heart, in my heart, in my heart

// You Can't Stop Me Loving You //

You can run and you can hide
You can tell me you're untrue
You can play around with my feelings
Say you found somebody new
But there's one thing you can't do
You can't stop me loving you

You know I love you baby
Why do you treat me this way
I don't deserve this kind of treatment
And I'd have been so good like a lover should
And I'd have loved you anyway, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

You can run and you can hide
You can tell me you're untrue
You can play around with my feelings
Say you found somebody new
But there's one thing you can't do
You can't stop me loving you

You're going to drive me crazy honey
Why are you so blind?
Cool, and I think you are so cool now baby
But you just can't see
All the loving me when I give you all the time

You can run and you can hide
You can tell me you're untrue
You can play around with my feelings
Say you found somebody new
But there's one thing you can't do
You can't stop me loving you

Oh I know I am going to be fine
You ain't going to pull my chain
I ain't going to change my mind

How do you feel baby?
I bet you feel real tall
Why did you leave your man, huh honey?
When I give you love and it's not enough
You try to make me look small

You can run and you can hide
You can tell me you're untrue
You can play around with my feelings
Say you found somebody new
But there's one thing you can't do
You can't stop me loving you

You can't stop me loving you
You can't stop me loving you
No matter what you do

You can't stop me loving you
You can't stop me loving you
No matter what you do

You can't stop me loving you
You can't stop me loving you
No matter what you do

// Ask Me How I Feel //

Oh, waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel?
When things are going wrong
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
The night is awful cold
Ask me how I feel?
You're much too loose to hold
Why don't you ask me how I feel?

I close my eyes
To follow you
To my surprise
You're so untrue

And I'm crying
I'm dying

Oh I'm waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel
And when you keep me hanging on
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
The waters run so deep
Ask me how I feel
When I don't get any sleep
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
And when you're down
You lean on me
You're a fool
Too blind to see

And I'm crying
I'm dying

Oh I'm waiting in the storm
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
Oh what the hell is going on?
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
When you stay out late at night
Oh ask me how I feel
When you think that I'm uptight
Why don't you ask me how I feel?

You don't treat me tender
No matter what I do
But I'm the great pretender
Whoa ho ho ho

Oh, waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel?
When things are going wrong
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
The night is awful cold
Ask me how I feel?
You're much too loose to hold
Why don't you ask me how I feel?

Oh I'm waiting in the storm
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
Oh what the hell is going on?
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
When you stay out late at night
Oh ask me how I feel
When you think that I'm uptight
Why don't you ask me how I feel?

Oh, waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel?
When things are going wrong
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
The night is awful cold
Ask me how I feel?
You're much too loose to hold
Why don't you ask me how I feel?

Oh I'm waiting in the storm
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
Oh what the hell is going on?
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
When you stay out late at night
Oh ask me how I feel
When you think that I'm uptight
Why don't you ask me how I feel?

Oh I'm waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel
When things are going wrong
Come on an' ask me how I feel
The night is awful cold
Ask me how I feel

// Falling Like Rain //

Really brings me down, I don't know how
That you can say you're not my kind
Couldn't find a cloud for miles around
Why do you change your story line
It all goes gray again
Sometimes I don't know when
To come out of the storm
It feels like forty days
And forty nights I've been
Beating on your door

Hey I'm falling like rain
Oh I, I love you, love you, love you
Falling like rain
Oh I, I'm coming down around you
I will always think about you

My sentimental ways
Don't seem to phase
You know I don't ever
Want to force your hand
If you met me one time
Just half the way
I could meet you where you are
Just meet me where I am
'Cause every now and then
You've got to drive right in
Deeper than deep
You take a chance and then
You give the wheel a spin
Anyone can see

Hey I'm falling like rain
Oh I, I love you, love you, love you
Falling like rain
Oh I, I'm coming down around you
I will always think about you

Falling like rain
It feels like forty days
And forty nights I've been
Beating on your door

Hey I'm falling like rain
Oh I, I love you, love you, love you
Falling like rain
Oh I, I'm coming down around you
I will always think about you

I love you, love you, love you
Falling like rain
Oh I, I'm only giving love you
I will always think about you
Oh you, love you, love you, love you

I love you, love you, love you
Falling like rain
Oh I, I'm only giving love you
I will always think about you
Oh you, love you, love you, love you

// Not Enough Romance //

Should've never made an eye contact
Should've been a heart of stone
When you stopped me to say hello
Would've been twice as easy to just say no
'Cause I don't want to lose at love again, hmm
But as a couple we were quite handsome
And the moon was out that night
So we let our hearts go dancing
If that thing is missing in my life

There's not enough romance in this world
There's not enough romance in this world
There's too many people thinking only of themselves
You got to give love for its return

Want to sing about new lovers
Stand up against the odds
Nothing can change a thing that strong
And myself I know my emotions
I got my love to share
And when you need something so tender
What you're looking for is so rare

There's not enough romance in this world
There's not enough romance in this world
There's too many people thinking only of themselves
You got to give love for its return

We take a lot of chances playing some foolish games
But that's the only price that you got to pay, oh ho
I got to keep believing hungry hearts run free
Everybody needs a good loving
It's anything you want it to be, oh ho, oh yeah
There's too many people thinking only of themselves
Got to give love for its return

There's not enough romance in this world
There's not enough romance in this world
There's too many people thinking only of themselves
You got to give love for its return

There's not enough romance in this world
There's not enough romance in this world
There's not enough romance in this world

// Foreign Affair //

A one in a million chance
You know the moment that you cross over the line
A casual glance
No one has to read between the lines

In the south of France it was springtime
Special feelings come alive
There's romance in the air, so they say
Love could be a small cafe away

Love is a piece of cake
And making love is all there is to eat
But it's a heart out of a limb
When you start to feel forever in a kiss

But you must remember there's no point of refuge
You only have a part in a lover's play
And you could be the one left in the dark
If someone takes a shortcut to your heart

And all too soon you're touching for the last time
No one has to tell you how it is
It's just a memory two people share
File it under foreign affairs

File it under foreign affairs
File it under foreign affairs
File it under foreign affairs
File it under foreign affairs
File it under foreign affairs
File it, file it
