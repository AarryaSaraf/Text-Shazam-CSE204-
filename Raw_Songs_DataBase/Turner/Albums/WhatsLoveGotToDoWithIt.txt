Album: WhatsLoveGotToDoWithIt

// I Might Have Been Queen //

I'm a new pair of eyes every time I am born
And original mind because I just died
And I'm scanning the horizon
For someone recognizing that I might have been queen
For every sun that sets there is a new one dawning
For every empire crushed there is a brand new nation
Let the waters rise
I have ridden each tide
From the gates of the city
Where the first born died

And I might have been queen
I remember the girl in the fields with no name
She had a love
Oh, but the rivers won't stop for me
No, the rivers won't stop for me

I'm a new pair of eyes and original mind
With my senses of old and the heart of a giant
And I'm searching through the wreckage
For some recollection that I might have been queen
For every sage that falls there's an ancient child

And I might have been queen
I remember the girl in the fields with no name
She had a love
Oh, but the rivers won't stop for me
No, the rivers won't stop for me

I look up to the stars with my perfect memory
I look through it all and my future is no shock to me
I look down but I see no tragedy
I look up to my past, a spirit running free
I look down, I look down and I'm there in history
Ho, I'm a soul survivor

A soul survivor on the river
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
I might have been queen
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
I might have been queen
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
I might have been queen
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
I might have been queen
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
I might have been queen

// What's Love Got To Do With It //

You must understand though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love?
Got to do it
Got to do it
What's love?

// Nutbush City Limits //

A church house, gin house
School house, outhouse
On highway number nineteen
The people keep the city clean

They call it Nutbush
Oh, Nutbush
They call it Nutbush city limits
Nutbush city

Twenty-five was the speed limit
Motorcycle not allowed in it
You go to store on Fridays
You go to church on Sundays

They call it Nutbush
Oh, Nutbush
Said they call it Nutbush city limits
Nutbush city

You go to field on the weekdays
And have a picnic on Labor Day
You go to town on Saturdays
And go to church on Sundays

They call it Nutbush
Oh, Nutbush
They call it Nutbush city limits
Nutbush city

No whiskey for sale
You get drunk, no bail
Salt pork and molasses
Is all you get in jail

They call it Nutbush
Oh, Nutbush
I said they call it Nutbush city limits
Nutbush city

A little old town in Tennessee
Quiet little old community
One-horse town
You got to watch what they're putting down

Oh, Nutbush
They call it Nutbush
They call it Nutbush
Oh, Nutbush
Oh
Oh
They call it Nutbush, yeah
They call it Nutbush
Nutbush city limits

// I Don't Wanna Fight //

There's a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Oh, like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon
It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere and we both know why
But me, I'm getting stronger
We must stop pretending, I can't live this life

I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking, babe
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go

I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
Can't you see that I don't care
Or are you looking right through me?
It seems to me that lately (Seems to me that lately)
You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry
Could it be that maybe (Could it be that maybe)
This crazy situation is the reason why?

I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking, babe
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
Time for letting go
Oh, baby, don't you know
That I don't wanna hurt no more?
It's time, I'm walking, babe
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go

Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We had to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart
Oh, don't wanna hurt no more

Oh, baby, don't you know?
No, I don't wanna hurt no more
Too much talking, babe
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
It's time, I'm walking, babe
So let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go
No, I don't wanna hurt no more
Too much, hey, baby
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
'Cause this is time for letting go

Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Hmm, so let it go

// Proud Mary //

[Tina:]
You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're going to do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'

[Ike:]
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

[Ike and Tina:]
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Listen to the story

Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling yeah
Rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Ya know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Ya know the big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)
Said we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)

[Tina:]
Oh I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
We're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river

We're up
Do do do do do do do do do do
Alright

Oh I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
We're rolling, said we're rolling, we're rolling on the river
I'll tell ya we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river

We're up
Do do do do do do do do do do
Alright
Yeah
Ooo yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooo

If you come down to the river
I bet you going to find some people who live
And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
And we're rolling, and we're rolling, and we're rolling on the river
Tell me one more time rolling, (Yeah)
Rolling, rolling on the river (All right, ooo yeah)

We're up
Do do do do do do do do do do
