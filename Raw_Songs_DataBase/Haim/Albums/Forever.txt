// Better Off //

I never wanna see you again with the beating of my heart witness
I say no, no, no, no, I'm done I'm done

I never wanna see you again with the beating of my heart witness
I say no, no, no, no, I'm done I'm done

Gettin' back to it
I wanna get back to everything I had
Before you came around, you fucked me up,
What am I to do now?
But in my mind I keep seeing you, seeing me,
And how good we used to be, used to be, used to be, used to be, used to be
I keep seeing you, seeing me
And how good we used to be, used to be, used to be, used to be, used to be

And now I'm finding I cannot deal with this
Going crazy wanna go leave you want in
Say you wanna work this out boy
You don't need to beg 'cause you'll never get it again

'Cause I'm better off this time so not this time
No, baby, not this time around
Oh I'm better off this time, so not this time
'Cause I found out yeah, I found out now

Forgiveness is that all you want from me
I won't fall into the arms of the one who turned on me
It's getting too dark for me to see

So I keep flashing back to when we met
We were better then, better then, better then, better then
I held you I didn't have to share it then
Better then better then better then better then
Now my mind is taking me back to this
Too much time to think about what it is
What made us fall apart
Well you don't need to beg 'cause you'll never get it again

'Cause I'm better off this time, so not this time
No no no not this time around
Oh I'm better off this time, so not this time
'Cause I found out you yeah I found out now

I'm better off this time, so not this time
No, baby, not this time around
Oh I'm better off this time, so not this time
'Cause I found out yeah I found out now

Oh you know I'm better off this time, better off this time
Oh you know I'm better off this time, better off this time
Oh you know I'm better off this time, 'cause I found out, I found out now

Oh you know I'm better off this time, better off this time
Oh you know I'm better off this time, better off this time
Oh you know I'm better off this time, 'cause I found out, I found out now

Forever we tried
Together we saw
I'm tired of fighting

Forever I see
Forever I'll try
No I never believed
Just another good reason to get it right

Forever we tried
Together we saw
I'm tired of fighting

Forever I see
Forever I'll try
No I never believed
Just another good reason to get it right

Forever we tried
Together we saw
Forever I see
Forever I'll try

Forever we tried
Together we saw
Forever I see
Forever I'll try
