// Los Angeles //

Los Angeles, give me a miracle, I just want out from this
I've done my share of helping with your defense
But now I can't dismiss
It's killin' me

Hometown of mine
Just got back from the boulevard, can't stop cryin'
The guy at the corner shop gave me a line and a smile
I know he was tryin', but a line is a lie

Oh, these days, these days, I can't win
These days I can't see no visions
I'm breakin', losin' faith
These days, these days (These days, these days)
These days, these days (These days, these days)

New York is cold
I tried the winter there once (Nope)
Clearly the greatest city in the world
But it was not my home, I felt more alone

These days, these days, I can't win
These days I can't see no visions
I'm breakin', losin' faith
These days, these days (These days, these days)
I'm thinkin' about leavin'

And sometimes I speed down crescent heights
I can't hardly feel it runnin' every light
But I wasn't fazed 'cause it wasn't mine
Was I just dreamin'?

And every time I think I might
(It's in my life, it's in my tears)
Leave this city for the first time
(Wavin' back to my fears, city of mine)
I wake up on the other side
(It's in my life, it's in my tears)
Oh, wonderin' was I just dreamin'
(Wavin' back to my fears, city of mine)

Was I just dreamin'?
(It's in my life, it's in my tears)
Oh
(Wavin' back to my fears, city of mine)
Oh, was I just dreamin'?

// The Steps //

So baby, when I'm near you
You can't feel me, I'm lightnin'
You used to come by
And sit down by my side
You would come in close
And take off all my clothes

Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
I can't understand, why you don't understand me
Baby
And every day I wake up and I make money for myself
And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
Do you understand?
You don't understand me
Baby

All the ivy
Is growing sideways
You won't stop it
'Till it covers all my place

Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
I can't understand, why you don't understand me
Baby
And every day I wake up and make money for myself
And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
Do you understand?
You don't understand me
Baby

If I go right
And you go left
Hey, I know we'll meet up again
And if you go left
And I go right
Hey, maybe that's just life sometimes

Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
I can't understand, why you don't understand me
Baby
And every day I wake up and make money for myself
And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
Do you understand?
You don't understand me
Baby

// I Know Alone //

Been a couple days since I've been out
Calling all my friends but they won't pick up
Found another room in a different place
Sleeping through the day and I dream the same

(I don't wanna)
I don't wanna give, I don't wanna give too much
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel at all

'Cause nights turn into days
That turn to grey
Keep turning over
Some things never grow
I know alone like no one else does

Some things never change
They never fade
It's never over
Some things never grow
I know alone like no one else does

Been a couple days since I've been around
Woke up at the wheel on the edge of town
It all looked the same, every mile
Screaming every word of "Both Sides Now"

(I don't wanna)
I don't wanna give, I don't wanna give too much
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel at all

'Cause nights turn into days
That turn to grey
Keep turning over
Some things never grow
I know alone like no one else does

Some things never change
They never fade
It's never over
Some things never grow
I know alone like no one else does

Days get slow like counting cell towers on the road
I know alone and I don't wanna talk about it
Friday hits and I feel like wasting everybody's time
When Sunday comes they expect me to shine
(Now Sunday comes and they expect her to shine)
(Now Sunday comes and they expect her to shine)
When Sunday comes they expect me to shine

[Repeat until the end:]
I know alone

(Now Sunday comes and they expect her to shine)
(Now Sunday comes and they expect her to shine)

Some things never change
They never fade
Some things never grow
I know alone

// Up From A Dream //

I was dreaming again, you were there with me
We were on the beach, running in the sea
You pointed to a sign, but in dreams you can't read
And in that moment I snapped again

Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep, but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen, pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye

Pretty baby
Innocently
Change the channel
On the TV

Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen, pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye

Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen, pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye

I could always dream
Could always leave
Could always breath
And still picture you there by my side
I could always slip out the front door
Find my way home
Only to crawl into bed next to you
At the end of the night

We were lying awake
Or so it seemed
Trying to figure out what was happening
Are we already up from the dream?
Or do we need to wake up again?

Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen, pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye

Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen, pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye

// Gasoline //

You took me back
But you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault
If I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughing up
Like I never smoked a pack

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys
Back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

I get sad, you know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad and I did it back
You needed as well, what's wrong with that?

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys
Back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
But when you lie in between my legs it doesn't matter
You say you wanna go slower but I wanna go faster
Faster, faster

Gasoline pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease

// 3am //

Hey, uh, what's up?
Just calling to see if you're still up
But straight to voicemail, uh
Yeah, no biggie
Um, if you're up or whatever, just hit me up

Why are you calling, 3 AM, my head is spinning?
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is, "Have I lost my mind?"
But I'm picking up for the last time

Either way, I'm gonna lose
But I just wanna give you
I just can't stop staring at it
I just can't resist

I'm floating away, keep floating away, floating away, floating away
I'm floating away, keep floating away, floating away, floating away

Now you're calling, 3 AM, my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is, "Have I lost my mind?"
But I'm picking up for the last time

You and I don't have to meet
But it's fun to think we could
Mmm, on the screen and on my jeans
Just make me feel good, oh

I'm floating away, keep floating away, floating away, floating away
I'm floating away, keep floating away, floating away, floating away

Now you're calling, 3 AM, my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is, "Have I lost my mind?"
But I'm picking up for the last time

(It's 3 AM)

Now you're calling, 3 AM
Now you're calling
Now you're calling, 3 AM
Now you're calling

// Don't Wanna //

Ooh, you, you did me so bad
When I was in the moment, well, I didn't understand
Ooh, you, you did me so harsh
Left me low in my high heels in the parking lot

Always thought I'd see it comin'
Mmm, but I don't
Gotta leave the engine runnin'
In the front seat, in my my mama's winter coat

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

Ooh, yeah, it's still early days
Don't know what I mean to you, don't know what to say
Ooh, yeah, don't walk away
Don't look at me like that, 'cause my mind's 'bout to change

Can't believe that I'm nervous
Mmm, face to face
All our problems on the surface, is it worth this?
I don't think it's too late

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

// Another Try //

One thing or two things
Never really mattered that much to me
Now all these apologies are on repeat
Is it destiny or just chemistry?
We're living in such extremes
And life won't wait around

So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line

One thing's true
Every memory leads back to you
Got your hat in the back faded up
Camo tee in the crease of the passenger seat
And every time I try to leave them out
My feelings come back around

So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line
But are we gonna give it another try?
But are we gonna give it another try?

Wrapped up in your old fleece
I put it on when I can't sleep
When I call and I can't reach you
Worried that it makes me look weak to you
(Just one more time, time)

So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line

Baby (We can give this another try)
Baby (If it don't work, then it's alright)
I'm wishing the best, baby
I'm wishing the best, baby (If it don't work, then it's alright)
I'm wishing the best, baby
I'm wishing the best, baby (If it don't work, then it's alright)

// Leaning On You //

I might forget to turn out all the lights
But you take care of me when I have to leave at dawn
I might sleep in past all my alarms
But you take care of us when I make it tough because

It takes all that I got
Not to fuck this up
So won't you let me know
If I'm not alone?
Leaning on you

Was I fearless at seventeen years old?
Or was I faking it? I was just a kid leaving home
Now I get scared for reasons I don't know
Is it just because I ain't tough enough
Being alone?

It takes all that I got
Not to fuck this up
So won't you let me know
If I'm not alone?
And I like what we got
But I'm scared of what it's not
So won't you let me know
If I'm not alone?
Leaning on you

It takes all that I got
Not to fuck this up
So won't you let me know
If I'm not alone?
And I like what we got
But I'm scared of what it's not
So won't you let me know
If I'm not alone?
Leaning on you

// I've Been Down //

I've been running around town
Feeling up and down
Taped up the windows at the house
But I ain't dead yet

Would you even pick me out in a crowd?
'Cause I can't recognize myself now
And I'm turning away help
Can you pull me out?

I've been down
I've been down

You say there's no stupid questions
Only stupid people
Well, I've been feelin' pretty foolish
Trying to get myself through this
And I've been watching too much TV
Looking up at the ceiling
It's been making me feel creepy
I'm just trying to shake this feeling

I've been down
I've been down
I've been down
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby)
Can you help me out?
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, honey)

I'm waking up at night
Tick-tock, killing time
A little moonlight coming through the blinds
The love of my life sleeping by my side
But I'm still down

Well, I think that we need to come together
I think that we need to come together
(You know I'm down)
I think that we need to come together
I think that we need to come together
(You know I'm down)

I've been down
I've been down
I've been down
Can you help me out?

I feel down
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby)
I feel down
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, honey)
I feel down
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby)
Can you help me out?
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, honey)

// Man From The Magazine //

Man from the magazine, what did you say?
Do you make the same faces in bed?
Hey, man, what kinda question is that?
What'd you really want me to say back?

What's goin' on behind those dark glasses?
Is this what you think makin' a pass is?
Wonderin' which door could get me out fastest
When I tell it now

I don't wanna hear, it is what it is
It was what it was
I don't wanna hear, it is what it is
It was what it was

You don't know how it feels, you expect me to deal with it
Till I'm perfectly numb
But you don't know how it feels

Man from the music shop, I drove too far
For you to hand me that starter guitar
Hey, girl, why don't you play a few bars
Oh, what's left to prove?

I don't wanna hear, it is what it is
It was what it was
Don't make me hear, it is what it is
It was what it was

You don't know how it feels, you expect me to deal with it
Till I'm perfectly numb
But you don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels

// All That Ever Mattered //

Oh, when I look in your face, when I look in your eyes
This is not what you wanted
You never liked surprises
It's not about them or what they think we do
I never cared about what they say
Only cared about me and you

I'm not something that you can buy
You know that I've never been that type
I never cared about this life
'Cause if you took it away

All that ever mattered was you, oh, baby
All that ever mattered was you
And I guess you never knew
All that ever mattered was you

So what is it like now that you don't have me?
So what is it like? Never mind, don't tell me
Do you think about all the things I did to you?
Do you think about how to get me back
When you remember that it's me?

All that ever mattered was you, oh, baby
All that ever mattered was you, oh, baby
And I guess you never knew
All that ever mattered was you, baby

I'm pulling away
I'm pulling away
I'm pulling away

All that ever mattered was you, baby
All that ever mattered was you, baby
And I guess you never knew
All that ever mattered was you, baby

// FUBT //

I kinda like it when you leave me at the party late
'Cause every now and then I wanna feel an empty space
I kinda like it when you say the things you shouldn't say
'Cause those are all the things that I was thinkin' anyway

It's wrong
That you could do no wrong
And, baby, even though
It makes me miserable

It's fucked up but it's true
That I love you like I do
But I'm just gonna keep on lovin' you
It's tough to get through
Either way, I'm gonna lose
So, I'm just gonna keep on loving you

I spend my mornings overthinkin' all my own mistakes
But I would never judge your problems in the same way
You beat yourself up and I let you take it out on me
Another day, another hour, no apology

How can I sleep when I can't dream at night?
All of my needs I say I don't need
How can I dream when I can't sleep at night?
All of my needs I say I don't need

And it's fucked up but it's true
That I love you like I do
But I'm just gonna keep on lovin' you
It's tough to get through
Either way I'm gonna lose
So, I'm just gonna keep on loving you

It's fucked up but it's true
Gonna keep on lovin' you
Till the days are through

// Gasoline (Remix) //

You took me back but you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault if I mess around
I took a drag but I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughing up like I've never smoked a pack

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off but you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

I get sad, you know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad (Did me bad, did me bad)
And I did it back (Did it back, did it back)
You needed ass, well
What's wrong with that?

Gasoline (Gasoline)
Pretty please (Pretty please)
I want to get off (Gasoline)
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys (Throw the keys)
Back to me (Back to me)
Go on and kick off your boots (Gasoline)
In the passenger's seat

(Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow)
We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
(Want you bad, want you bad, don't you know?)
When you're lying between my legs it doesn't matter
(Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow)
You say you want to go slower but I want to go faster
(I want you bad, want you bad)
Faster and faster

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off but you're such a tease

// 3am (Remix) //

Why're you calling
3 am my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets on my bed
Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time

Either way I'm gonna lose
But I just wanna give
I just can't stop staring at it
I just can't resist

I'm floating away
Floating away
Floating away
I'm floating away
Floating away
Floating away

Now you're calling
3 am my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time
(Hello. What are you doing?)

You and I don't have to meet
But it's fun to think we could
On the screen and in my jeans
Just make me feel good

I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away
Floating away
I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away
Just floating away
I'm floating away

Now you're calling
3 am my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time

(It's 3 AM)
(Ayy, what's up?)
(Just looking through all these photos on my phone)
(What are you up to?)
(You know I'm calling, it's 3 AM)

// Now I'm In It //

Looking in the mirror again and and again
Wishing the reflection would tell me something, I
I can't get a hold of myself
And can't get out of this situation

Walking in a straight line thinking about last time
This time I said I would do this right
Said I would never break this promise
But now I'm back to counting on us

We cannot be friends
Can not pretend
That it makes sense

We cannot be friends
Can not pretend
That it makes sense

'Cause now I'm in it
But I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
Damn, I'm in it
And I've trying to find my way back for a minute

Locking all the doors to my house
I'm alone in my head but I wish you were in my bed
Can't get read on myself
Gotta change this situation

Something in the way that I felt when I woke up
Told me that I shouldn't give in, give up hope
Told me that I shouldn't fight what felt
Told me I should not let go 'cause

We cannot be friends
Can not pretend
That it makes sense

'Cause now I'm in it
But I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
Damn, I'm in it
And I've trying to find my way back for a minute

Now I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
And the rain keeps coming down along the ceiling
And I can hear it but I can't feel it

Took me so long
To fall
And now I'm in it
Now I'm in it

'Cause now I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
And the rain keeps coming down along the ceiling
And I can hear it but I can't feel it

// Hallelujah //

I met two angels but they were in disguise
Took one look to realize
Tell 'em anything and they will sympathize
These arms hold me tight
Old fears, helped to ease them in my mind
New tears say that they will dry in time

Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Hallelujah

Laughing together like our thoughts are harmonized
Been that way since '95
Give me direction when it is hard to fight
Three roads, one light
Now and then I can lean my back to yours
Travelin' like our feet don't touch the floor

Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?

I had a best friend but she has come to pass
One I wish I could see now
You always remind me that memories will last
These arms reach out
You were there to protect me like a shield
Long hair running with me through the field
Everywhere you've been with me all along

Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Hallelujah

// Summer Girl //

L.A. on my mind, I can't breathe
You're there when I close my eyes, so hard to reach
Your smiles turn into crying, it's the same release
And you always know, and you always know

I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl

Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du

Lightning in your eyes, you can't speak
Falling from the sky, down to me
I see it in your face, I'm relief
I'm your summer girl

I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl

Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du

Peer around the corner at you
From over my shoulder I need you
I need you to understand
These are the earthquake drills that we ran
Under the freeway overpasses
The tears behind your dark sunglasses
The fears inside your heart as deep as gashes
You walk beside me, not behind me
Feel my unconditional love

Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du

And I can see the angels coming down
Like a wave that's crashing on the ground
I can see the angels coming now
Like a wave that's crashing on the ground
