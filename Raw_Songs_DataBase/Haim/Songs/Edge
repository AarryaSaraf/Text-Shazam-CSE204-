I was always running, always hurt
But I couldn't let it go, it was too hard to get going
And I kept hoping that you would run first
I couldn't let it go, you were too good to know

You were my own
The memories hold
They're overgrown

But now I know
There's no climbing over
Because I know you'll never see me through

Well, I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
I can't fight it off, I can't fight it off

Oh, you know you could've had it all
But you want me like your crown
And it seemed your favorite thing to do
Was to keep me in the dark and turned around

You can say I'm crazy for giving up
You can wave your sayings like a flag
You can wave it high over your head
You can sing your song to bring me down

You were my own
The memories hold
They're over grown

Mo-ments of the past
have dimmed too much to bring us back

Well, I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
I can't fight it off, I can't fight it off

Well, I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
I can't fight it off, I can't fight it off

No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no I can't fight it off (Over and over, over and over)

No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no I can't fight it off (Over and over, over and over)


Well, I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
And I can't fight it off, I can't fight it off

Edge of what could be 
Edge of what could be 
Edge of what could be 
Edge of what could be 
Edge of what could be 
Edge of what could be
