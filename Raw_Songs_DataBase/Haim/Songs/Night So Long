I say goodbye to love again
In loneliness, my only friend
In loneliness, my only fear
The night's end
Then I say goodbye to love once more
No shadow darkening the door
Until your memory is gone
The night, slow, long

Then I say goodbye to love again
In loneliness, my only friend
In loneliness, my only fear
The night's end
Then I say goodbye to love once more
No shadow darkening the door
Until your memory is gone
The night, slow, long

(I say goodbye to love again) slow, long
(I say goodbye to love again) slow, long
(I say goodbye to love again) slow, long
(I say goodbye to love again) slow, long
