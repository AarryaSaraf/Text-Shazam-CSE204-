Los Angeles, give me a miracle, I just want out from this
I've done my share of helping with your defense
But now I can't dismiss
It's killin' me

Hometown of mine
Just got back from the boulevard, can't stop cryin'
The guy at the corner shop gave me a line and a smile
I know he was tryin', but a line is a lie

Oh, these days, these days, I can't win
These days I can't see no visions
I'm breakin', losin' faith
These days, these days (These days, these days)
These days, these days (These days, these days)

New York is cold
I tried the winter there once (Nope)
Clearly the greatest city in the world
But it was not my home, I felt more alone

These days, these days, I can't win
These days I can't see no visions
I'm breakin', losin' faith
These days, these days (These days, these days)
I'm thinkin' about leavin'

And sometimes I speed down crescent heights
I can't hardly feel it runnin' every light
But I wasn't fazed 'cause it wasn't mine
Was I just dreamin'?

And every time I think I might
(It's in my life, it's in my tears)
Leave this city for the first time
(Wavin' back to my fears, city of mine)
I wake up on the other side
(It's in my life, it's in my tears)
Oh, wonderin' was I just dreamin'
(Wavin' back to my fears, city of mine)

Was I just dreamin'?
(It's in my life, it's in my tears)
Oh
(Wavin' back to my fears, city of mine)
Oh, was I just dreamin'?
