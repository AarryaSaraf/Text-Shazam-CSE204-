Man from the magazine, what did you say?
Do you make the same faces in bed?
Hey, man, what kinda question is that?
What'd you really want me to say back?

What's goin' on behind those dark glasses?
Is this what you think makin' a pass is?
Wonderin' which door could get me out fastest
When I tell it now

I don't wanna hear, it is what it is
It was what it was
I don't wanna hear, it is what it is
It was what it was

You don't know how it feels, you expect me to deal with it
Till I'm perfectly numb
But you don't know how it feels

Man from the music shop, I drove too far
For you to hand me that starter guitar
Hey, girl, why don't you play a few bars
Oh, what's left to prove?

I don't wanna hear, it is what it is
It was what it was
Don't make me hear, it is what it is
It was what it was

You don't know how it feels, you expect me to deal with it
Till I'm perfectly numb
But you don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
