Ooh, you, you did me so bad
When I was in the moment, well, I didn't understand
Ooh, you, you did me so harsh
Left me low in my high heels in the parking lot

Always thought I'd see it comin'
Mmm, but I don't
Gotta leave the engine runnin'
In the front seat, in my my mama's winter coat

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

Ooh, yeah, it's still early days
Don't know what I mean to you, don't know what to say
Ooh, yeah, don't walk away
Don't look at me like that, 'cause my mind's 'bout to change

Can't believe that I'm nervous
Mmm, face to face
All our problems on the surface, is it worth this?
I don't think it's too late

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet

I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to
Well, we both had nights wakin' up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give up yet
