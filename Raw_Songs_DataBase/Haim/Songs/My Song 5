I found it hard
Tried to reserve
I'll get it right
When I am hurt

(hot for me)
The man's his own
(hot for me)
To her he'll go
(hot for me)
But I'll be fine
(hot for me)
'Cause I know

He's in her heart on the floor
Thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up going through
Crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head
Seeing all the words unsaid
Honey, honey, I am never coming home again

I've been lied to
So what's the truth?
Now I'm not gonna hide it all, keep it in all from you
I've been dying to know what you've tried
You've been lying
So, honey, I'm not your honey pie

He's in her heart on the floor
Thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up, going through
Crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head
Seeing all the words unsaid
Honey, honey, I am never coming home again

If you want to take me, baby, please
Been holding on for eternity
Save you only for me
Missing you never led to much of anything

If you wanna know, if you wanna show me
What it means, what it seems, seems to be
Held by a thread
Tried to forget
But I'll never let it go

Honey, I'm not your honey pie

Tried to lie, dying
Hear all lies, trying
Tried to lie, dying
Hear all lies, trying

He's in her heart on the floor
Thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up, going through
Crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head
Seeing all the words unsaid
Honey, honey, I am never coming home again

I've been lied to
So, what's the truth?
No, I'm not gonna hide it all, keep it in all from you
I've been dying to
Know what you've tried
You've been lying
So, honey, I'm not your honey pie
