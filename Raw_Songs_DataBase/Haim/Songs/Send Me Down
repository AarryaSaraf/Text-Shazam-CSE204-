You came back,
Back into my arms
Like a heart attack-tack,
With your certain charms
Coming right through my eyes
Over my body, a hand on my thigh,
And I wanna make nice
Now that you're back to me,
And I wanna do right by you,
With my whole being
C'mon baby, while I was star-gazing
You were with the other one,
but now

Cover your eyes, do I feel right darling?
Remember, want to make this right
Now that you're mine, do right by me
Baby, wanna feel you cross the line!
So send me down
Ooooh ooh eeh oh
I wanna push you around
Ooooh oh eh oh
Gonna send me down
Ooooh oh oh ye oh
I wanna push you around
Ooooh oh oh oh.

Back then, back when I could see
You were my only friend,
I was too scared that
I couldn't let you in,
Like a gambler
Only playing to win.

Cover your eyes, do I feel right
Remember, want to make this right
Now that you're mine, do right by me
Baby, wanna feel you cross the line!
So send me down
Ooooh ooh eeh oh
I wanna push you around
Ooooh oh eh oh
Send me down
Ooooh oh oh ye oh
I wanna push you around
Ooooh oh oh oh.

No, no enough is enough
If you're willing too
Because you're right for me
No, no enough is enough
If you're willing too
Because you're right for me
No, no enough is enough
If you're willing too
Because you're right for me

I don't wanna run
Back to the way we were
I don't wanna run
Back to the way we were
Send me down
Oh oooh oh oh ye oh
I wanna push you around
Oooh oh oh ey oh
Send me down
Oh oooh oh oh ye oh
I wanna push you around
Oooh oh oh ey oh.
So, send me down!
Oh oooh oh oh ye oh
I wanna push you around
Oooh oh oh ey oh.
