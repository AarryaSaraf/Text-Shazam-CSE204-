I know you and me
Everything was supposed to be
But I don't really want to
I don't really understand how that has to be
How can I breathe?
How can I breathe?
It's not, it's not that easy

I know that you want this to keep up going on
But I don't really want to
You just need to understand that this is all wrong
Why can't you see?
Why can't you please just stop?
Just stay away from me

I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop

Cause you have some place to go
And you have some place to show
And I have some place to show
And you have some place to show

Why can't things just stay, so they'll always be the same
Cause I don't really want to
I don't really understand how things have to change
Why can't you see?
Why can't you please just stop?
Stop suffocating me

I know that you want this to keep up going on
But I can't decide
I can not decide
I can not decide
How can I breathe?
How can I breathe?
Just stop, just stay away from me

I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop

That you have some place to go
And I got some place to show
And I have some place to go
And you got some place to show
