Talk to me nice or don't talk to me

I found it hard
Tried to reserve
I'll get it right
When I am heard
(Hot for me)
The man's his own
(Hot for me)
And to her he'll go
(Hot for me)
But I'll be fine
(Hot for me)
'Cause I know

He's in her heart on the floor, thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up going through the crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head, seeing all the words unsaid
Honey honey, I am never coming home again

I've been lied to, so what's the truth?
Now I'm not gonna hide it all, keep it in, all from you
I've been dying to know what you've tried
You've been lying so
Honey, I'm not your honey pie

He's in her heart on the floor, thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up going through the crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head, seeing all the words unsaid
Honey honey, I am never coming home again

If you want to see me, baby please
Been holding on for eternity
Say you only want me
Missing you never led to much of anything
If you wanna know, if you wanna show me
What it means, what it seemed, seemed to be
Held by a thread, tried to forget
But I'll never let it go


Can you handle the truth? I don't think you can
Jealous now 'cause I'm working with this female band
She wanna consume the world and get all females banned
Always talkin' about marriage, I don't see those plans
And yes, I cheated once and so did you
You let your girl eat you out like a bowl of soup
And how you didn't include Mr. Master Bruce?
Two girls in the nude I couldn't wait to intrude
I couldn't wait to penetrate the both of you two
You probably woulda been scared I wasn't noticing you
Scared I'd be occupied with your friend, my nose in the boobs
But we ain't play that game cause you probably would lose
Honey pie, don't front like you goodie-two-shoes
You ain't got no money, how'd you get those shoes?
I put the clothes on your back, this the thanks I get?
Is this April? This must be a prank of some shit

He's in her heart on the floor, thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up going through the crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head, seeing all the words unsaid
Honey honey, I am never coming home again

I've been lied to, so what's the truth?
Now I'm not gonna hide it all, keep it in, all from you
I've been dying to know what you've tried
You've been lying so
Honey, I'm not your honey pie
