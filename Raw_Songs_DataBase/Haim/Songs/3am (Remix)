Why're you calling
3 am my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets on my bed
Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time

Either way I'm gonna lose
But I just wanna give
I just can't stop staring at it
I just can't resist

I'm floating away
Floating away
Floating away
I'm floating away
Floating away
Floating away

Now you're calling
3 am my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time
(Hello. What are you doing?)

You and I don't have to meet
But it's fun to think we could
On the screen and in my jeans
Just make me feel good

I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away
Floating away
I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away
Just floating away
I'm floating away

Now you're calling
3 am my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time

(It's 3 AM)
(Ayy, what's up?)
(Just looking through all these photos on my phone)
(What are you up to?)
(You know I'm calling, it's 3 AM)
