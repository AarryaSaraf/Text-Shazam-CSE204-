I went back to a room
And every memory came rushing back too soon
As I packed my bags and I lied down
I felt the bed sink in and the covers surround (I let go (oh))
Cause with my eyes closed I see the door open wide (oh)
And with my eyes closed I'm leaving it all behind

I will run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
And I will run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
When you come my way
I'll keep running if you come my way

Jumped back in a daze
I saw the faces slowly slowly slip away
Let me hide your eyes, it's too bright
And now I'm slipping through the white
Bringing me into cold dark night
And with my eyes closed I see the door open wide

I will run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
And I, I will run away if you call my name
I, oh, I'll keep running if you come my way
When you come my way
I'll keep running if you come my way

And with my eyes closed I see the door open wide
(I'll keep running if you come my way)
And with my eyes closed I see the door open wide
(I'll keep running if you come my way)
And with my eyes closed I'm leaving it all behind

I will run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
I will run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
When you come my way
I'll keep running if you come my way

Keep keep running if you call my name
I'll keep running if you call my name
