You don't wanna talk, don't wanna work it out
If you were gonna face it, you would've by now
When were you around, when were you a...
I waited hours and hours, hearing loud sirens
Suffered til' I saw it differently
You see, now I'm not coming around
Coming around, coming around

I'm walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
...

You don't wanna give and you don't wanna know how
If you were gonna change things, you would've by now
When were you around, when were you a...
Trying not think about it, baby
Run it up and down the stairs
'Til there's nothing left between us but what we won't say

Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
...

I know I said it so many times before
But now it's keeping me awake
I know you did it so many times before
But I never thought I'd be the one you'd betray
(Walking away...)
Away, I'm not gonna wait
Nothing you can say that'll make me rethink
Every chance that we had and messed up
All the times it got away from us
(Walking away...)
Away, I'm not gonna wait
Nothing you can say that'll make me rethink
Every chance that we had and messed up
All the times it got away from us

Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
