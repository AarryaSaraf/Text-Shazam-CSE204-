Looking in the mirror again and and again
Wishing the reflection would tell me something, I
I can't get a hold of myself
And can't get out of this situation

Walking in a straight line thinking about last time
This time I said I would do this right
Said I would never break this promise
But now I'm back to counting on us

We cannot be friends
Can not pretend
That it makes sense

We cannot be friends
Can not pretend
That it makes sense

'Cause now I'm in it
But I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
Damn, I'm in it
And I've trying to find my way back for a minute

Locking all the doors to my house
I'm alone in my head but I wish you were in my bed
Can't get read on myself
Gotta change this situation

Something in the way that I felt when I woke up
Told me that I shouldn't give in, give up hope
Told me that I shouldn't fight what felt
Told me I should not let go 'cause

We cannot be friends
Can not pretend
That it makes sense

'Cause now I'm in it
But I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
Damn, I'm in it
And I've trying to find my way back for a minute

Now I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
And the rain keeps coming down along the ceiling
And I can hear it but I can't feel it

Took me so long
To fall
And now I'm in it
Now I'm in it

'Cause now I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
And the rain keeps coming down along the ceiling
And I can hear it but I can't feel it
