Get me out,
Give me in,
I gave you everything I could give.
You try to take,
And you try to make it,
but take all everything you can't break.

If you go so easily,
Go on, get out, when you leave,
I will wait, I will want, wait 'til the day you're back again.

Let me out,
Let me in,
I've giving up, not giving in.
'Cause together we are not one, we are nothing.
We're holding on, and on.

Together now, forever then.
Go ahead, don't you let me in.
But I will wait, and I will want.
Wait 'til the day you're back again.

Let me go.
You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
You know I'm nothing without your love, no.
I know I'm nothing without your love, no.
So let me go.
(Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
You know I'm nothing without your love, no.
I know I'm nothing without your love.
So please, God, let me go.

Let me out,
Let me in.
I gave you everything I could give.
You try to take,
you try to make,
You take all everything you can't make.

If you go so easily,
Go on, get out, when you leave,
I will wait, I will want, wait 'til the day you're back again.

Let it out,
Let it in.
I'm giving up, not giving in,
'Cause together we are not one, we are nothing, holdin' on and on.

Together now, forever then.
Go ahead, don't you let me in.
I will wait, I will want, wait 'til the day you're back again.

Let me go.
You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
You know that I'm nothing without your love, no.
You know I'm nothing without your love, no.
'Cause you know that I'm not one for leaving,
No, I'm not one for leaving,

But I'll go on believing, hey, I'll go on believing.
And I'm not one for leaving, no, I'm not for leaving,
No, I'm not one for leaving, no, I'm not one for leaving.
So let me go.

You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
(Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
(Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
(Let me go)
Let me go.
(Let me go)
Let me go.
