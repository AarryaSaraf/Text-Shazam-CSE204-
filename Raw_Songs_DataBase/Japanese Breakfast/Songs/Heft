I wanna churn like
Amish butter
I wanna move out
Of your way
I wanna find what's
There in your stomach
If it's the same dark
And it's too late

What if?
It's the same dark coming, the same dark
What if?
It's the same dark coming, the same dark oh fuck it all then

I spent the summer
Trying to be sweeter
I spent the summer
Staying in
I went a mile, I'm on another
Spent my nights by hospital beds

What if?
It's the same dark coming, the same dark
What if?
It's the same dark coming, the same dark then fuck it all
