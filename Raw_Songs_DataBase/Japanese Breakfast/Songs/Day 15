You don't know what I want
You don't know anything
The doctors don't know anything
It's not right, not right
Scream out loud, kick the wall
Will you run when I call?
The doctors don't know anything
It's not right, it's not right
Well my belly sure does hurt me, but it's O.K. 'cause I feel damn alive
The contractions come and go like a birth; but if a baby's on the way, I'd be surprised

He looks like a junkie sometimes
But junkies have beautiful eyes
The doctors don't know anything
It's not right, it's not right
You're all tired of hearing me
Talk about the "sore tummy"
The doctors don't know anything
It's not right, not right
Well my belly sure does hurt me, but it's O.K. 'cause I feel alive
The contractions come and go like a birth; but if a baby's on the way, I'd be surprised, be surprised, surprised
