I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace
Against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance
With a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration
'Cause I need you this much
You're wasting my time
You're just wasting time

Something happens, and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't... don't throw it away

I made a fire, and watching it burn
I thought of your future
With one foot in the past now,
Just how long can this last?
Have you no ambition?
My mother and my brothers
Used to breathe in clean air
And dreaming I'm a doctor
It's hard to be a man
When there's a gun in your hand
Oh, I feel so...

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't... don't throw it away
