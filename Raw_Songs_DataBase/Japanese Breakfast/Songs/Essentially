Ignore essentially I'll admit that they were right
Who was I to judge your brand of loneliness?
Who was I to think I was someone above desire?
Love me essentially, love me like someone else's wife
How is it you fall asleep so easy?
Who is it you're dreaming of tonight?

How lovely essentially (Love, the thing that you can't buy)
Love me essentially (Hug me 'til I fill up your time)
Well you got it all wrong if I'd been what you're after
When you've got it all wrong I can't find what you want

I lie awake to reach for the soft sound in the night
Try my best to swallow up the jealousy
Try to learn to fall hard back in love with all the sad

Love you essentially (Love, one thing that you can't buy)
Love you essentially (Hug me 'til I fill up your time)
When you've got it all wrong I'm finally what you're after
I got it all wrong, I don't know what I want
When you've got it all wrong and don't know what you're after
When you've got it all wrong if I found what you want
