If you think I'm sexy you should say it now (just say I'm sexy)
I'm not the kind to sit around and wait
I know you're scared to feel so much so fast (so much so fast)
Why bear your weapons if you're not promising to bleed

Get that heart
On my tide

Cause Oregon girls never carry an umbrella
Even when it looks like it's going to rain
Oh this Oregon girl, never carries an umbrella
Cause Oregon girls used to raining everyday
