I love the way they love each other
Why can't you love me like that?
With a complimentary facial formatting and perfectly suited astrological signs

I hate it when you leave the house

Why are we always watching TV?
When did we get so boring?
Why don't you ever reach for me in bed why don't we ever go out (even to like a Chilis or something)

It's nice to get out of the house
