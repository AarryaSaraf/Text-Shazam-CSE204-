[Korean:]

그들에게 말해
내가 오고 있다
밤이 깊어져 나를 기다리는 건 실수 밖에 없네

감정에 사로잡혀
현실은 부정하고
상상해봤지 넌 나를 떠나고 난 널 쫓아가는 거

내게 반성해봐, 그렇잖아
내게 반성해봐, 그게 낫잖아!

Be Sweet to me baby
난 너를 믿고 싶어, 너무 믿고 싶은데 말이야
Be Sweet to me baby
난 너를 믿고 싶어, 무언가를 믿고 싶은데

나를 데려가요
진정시켜줘
니 거짓말 다시 처음부터 시작해봐, 감정을 넣어서
돌려놔 너의 거짓말 make it up once more with feeling

실수라 말해줘
다시 품에 안을게
너무 늦지는 마
I loved you always

니 실수 인정해, 다시 들여보낼게
늦게 깨달은 건, 사랑했단 거

내게 반성해봐, 그렇잖아
내게 반성해봐, 그게 낫잖아!

Be Sweet to me baby
난 너를 믿고 싶어, 너무 믿고 싶은데 말이야
Be Sweet to me baby
난 너를 믿고 싶어, 무언가를 믿고 싶은데
Be Sweet to me baby
난 너를 믿고 싶어, 너무 믿고 싶은데 말이야
Be Sweet to me baby
난 너를 믿고 싶어, 무언가를 믿고 싶은데

// Beating Off //

Caught you beating off onto photos of my friends
While your roommate's hair made figure 8s
And we each cast up a dry spell
Yeah!

// Bread //

I awoke without breasts
Just a clean, hard slate
I ran my hands over the new formed surface

Turned to you in bed
With some fear I'm being honest
But it's what I've always wanted
To be your man

Oh, to win your bread

// Dreams //

Oh my life
Is changing every day
Every possible way
Oh my dreams
Never quite as it seems
Never quite as it seems

Never felt like this before
Now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you
Now I open up and see
The person falling here is me
A different way to be

I want more
Impossible to ignore
Impossible to ignore
They'll come true
Impossible not to do
Impossible not to do

Now I tell you openly
You have my heart so don't hurt me
You're what I couldn't find
A totally amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me

Oh my life
Is changing every day
Every possible way
Oh my dreams
Never quite as it seems
Cause you're a dream to me
Dream to me

// Essentially //

Ignore essentially I'll admit that they were right
Who was I to judge your brand of loneliness?
Who was I to think I was someone above desire?
Love me essentially, love me like someone else's wife
How is it you fall asleep so easy?
Who is it you're dreaming of tonight?

How lovely essentially (Love, the thing that you can't buy)
Love me essentially (Hug me 'til I fill up your time)
Well you got it all wrong if I'd been what you're after
When you've got it all wrong I can't find what you want

I lie awake to reach for the soft sound in the night
Try my best to swallow up the jealousy
Try to learn to fall hard back in love with all the sad

Love you essentially (Love, one thing that you can't buy)
Love you essentially (Hug me 'til I fill up your time)
When you've got it all wrong I'm finally what you're after
I got it all wrong, I don't know what I want
When you've got it all wrong and don't know what you're after
When you've got it all wrong if I found what you want

// Head Over Heels //

I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace
Against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance
With a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration
'Cause I need you this much
You're wasting my time
You're just wasting time

Something happens, and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't... don't throw it away

I made a fire, and watching it burn
I thought of your future
With one foot in the past now,
Just how long can this last?
Have you no ambition?
My mother and my brothers
Used to breathe in clean air
And dreaming I'm a doctor
It's hard to be a man
When there's a gun in your hand
Oh, I feel so...

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't... don't throw it away

// Nobody Sees Me Like You Do //

I see your face looking into the space
All tired and worried
Why does it have to be like this?
You and I, I wanted us to be happy

No one can see me like you do
No one can see you like I do

I see your face with a trace of life
Being a wife and a woman
If I ever hurt you, please remember
I wanted us to be happy
Is there anything I want more
More than your trust and understanding?

No one can see me like you do
No one can see you like I do

I wanna quit moving, I wanna quit running
I wanna relax and be tender
I wanna see us together again
Rocking away in our walnut chairs
Even with your warmth and closeness
The feeling of loneliness hangs over like a curse

No one can see me like you do
No one can see you like I do
Even with our dreams and yearnings
The feeling of loneliness hangs over like a thirst
No one can see me like you do
No one can see you like I do
No one can see me like you do
No one can see you like I do

No one, no one
No one, no one

// Skinny Love //

Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My my my, my my my, my my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My my my, my my my, my my
Right in this moment, this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My my my, my my my, my my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?
