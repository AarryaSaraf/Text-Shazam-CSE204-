// My Cherie Amour //

La la la la la la, La la la la la la

My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

La la la la la la, La la la la la la
La la la la la la, La la la la la la

Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

La la la la la la, La la la la la la
La la la la la la, La la la la la la

// Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours //

Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo baby, here I am,
Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo baby, here I am,
Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)

Here I am baby,
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)

I've done alot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
Hey, hey, yea, yea, didn't I, oh baby

Seen alot of things in this old world
When I touched them they did nothing, girl

Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered,
I'm yours, oh I'm yours
Oo-wee babe you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you are my only desire

Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered,
I'm yours Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)

Here I am baby,
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)

I've done alot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man but here I am

With your future, got your future babe (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby, (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby, (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)

// You Are The Sunshine Of My Life //

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around, 
You are the apple of my eye, 
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

I feel like this is the beginning, 
Though I've loved you for a million years, 
And if I thought our love was ending, 
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life, 
That's why I'll always stay around, 
You are the apple of my eye, 
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely, 
Because you came to my rescue, 
And I know that this must be heaven, 
How could so much love be inside of you? 

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah, 
That's why I'll always stay around, 
You are the apple of my eye, 
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

[Background] Love has joined us, 
Love has joined us, 
Let's think sweet love

// Superstition //

Very superstitious, writings on the wall, 
Very superstitious, ladders 'bout to fall, 
Thirteen-months-old baby broke the lookin' glass 
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past

When you believe in things that you don't understand, 
Then you suffer, 
Superstition ain't the way 

Very superstitious, wash your face and hands, 
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can, 
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong, 
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song 

When you believe in things that you don't understand, 
Then you suffer, 
Superstition ain't the way, yeah, yeah 

Very superstitious, nothin' more to say, 
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way, 
Thirteen-months-old baby broke the lookin' glass, 
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past 

When you believe in things that you don't understand, 
Then you suffer, superstition ain't the way, no, no, no

// Living For The City //

A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city...ee ha!

His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floor for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city...yeah

His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city...um hum

Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Cause where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city...
Living just enough...
For the city...ooh,ooh
[repeat several times]

His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution
Living just enough, just enough for the city...yeah, yeah, yeah!

I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel no where could be much colder
If we don't change the world will soon be over
Living just enough, just enough for the city!!!!

La, la, la, la, la, la,
Da Ba Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Ba Da Da Da Da Da Da Da
[Repeat to end]

// Higher Ground //

People keep on learnin' 
Soldiers keep on warrin' 
World keep on turnin' 
Cause it won't be too long 

Powers keep on lyin' 
While your people keep on dyin' 
World keep on turnin' 
Cause it won't be too long 

I'm so darn glad he let me try it again 
Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin 
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then 
Gonna keep on tryin' 
Till I reach my highest ground 

Teachers keep on teachin' 
Preachers keep on preachin' 
World keep on turnin' 
Cause it won't be too long 
Oh no 

Lovers keep on lovin' 
Believers keep on believin' 
Sleepers just stop sleepin' 
Cause it won't be too long 
Oh no 

I'm so glad that he let me try it again 
Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin 
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then 
Gonna keep on tryin' 
Till I reach my highest ground...Whew! 

Till I reach my highest ground 
No one's gonna bring me down 
Oh no 
Till I reach my highest ground 
Don't let nobody bring you down (they'll sho 'nuff try) 
God is gonna show you higher ground 
He's the only friend you have around 
[FADE]

// Village Ghetto Land //

Would you like to go with me
Down my dead end street
Would you like to come with me
To Village Ghetto Land

See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meal - from garbage cans

Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police

Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink - drunk to all demands

Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the streets
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief

Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land

Village Ghetto Land

// Sir Duke //

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all over - all over now people

Can't you feel it all over
Come on let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody - all over people

// I Wish //

Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With 'Boy thought I told you not to go outside'
Tryin' your best to bring the
Water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her
From whippin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's tellin'
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through

Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall
(you nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go

// Pastime Paradise //

They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a pastime paradise 
They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a pastime paradise 
They've been wasting most their lives 
Glorifying days long gone behind 
They've been wasting most their days 
In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise 
Tell me who of them will come to be 
How many of them are you and me 

Dissipation
Race Relations 
Consolation 
Segregation 
Dispensation 
Isolation 
Exploitation 
Mutilation 
Mutations 
Miscreation 
Confirmation.......to the evils of the world 

They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a future paradise 
They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a future paradise 
They've been looking in their minds 
For the day that sorrow's gone from time 
They keep telling of the day 
When the Savior of love will come to stay 
Tell me who of them will come to be 
How many of them are you and me 

Proclamation of Race Relations 
Consolation 
Integration 
Verification of Revelations 
Acclamation 
World Salvation 
Vibrations 
Simulation 
Confirmation.......to the peace of the world 

They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a pastime paradise 
They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a pastime paradise 
They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a future paradise 
They've been spending most their lives 
Living in a future paradise 
We've been spending too much of our lives 
Living in a pastime paradise 

Let's start living our lives 
Living for the future paradise 
Praise to our lives 
Living for the future paradise 
Shame to anyones lives 
Living in a pastime paradise

// If It's Magic //

If it's magic...
Then why can't it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poets in this rhyme
Like the galaxies in time 

If it's pleasing...
Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells 

It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst 

So...
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child 

It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst 

So...
If it's magic...
Why can't we make it everlasting
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone

// Another Star //

La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la

La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la

For you
There might be a brighter star
But through my eyes the light of you is all I see

For you
There might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody

So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two

For you
Love might bring a toast of wine
But with each sparkle know the best for you I pray

For you
Love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday

So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two

For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you is all I see

For you
There might be another song
But in my heart your melody will stay with me

// Rocket Love //

Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do
Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do-oo

I longed for you since I was born
A woman sensitive and warm
And that you were

With pride and strength no one would test
But yet have feminine finesse
And so much more

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

A female Shakespeare of your time
With looks to blow Picasso's mind
You were the best

Your body moved with grace and song
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms
Nevertheless, oh oh

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Ooh you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

Da Da Da, Da Da Da, Da Da Da, Da Da Da
Da Da Da, Da Da Da-aa

The passion burning in your heart
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
Where did it go

Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never know

But you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Baby you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

Cold, too cold, you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Oh, Oh, Oh, took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down into this cold, cold world
I would not do that to a dog
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

Ooh baby

Rocket love

// Master Blaster //

Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you 
would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

Didn't know that you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on

You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no, 
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Na, na na...
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you 
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you 
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling 
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
because you feel your body jammin'
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Oh, Oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
