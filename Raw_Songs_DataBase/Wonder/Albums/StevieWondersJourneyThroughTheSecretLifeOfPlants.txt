// Same Old Story //

Born to open for
Mankind nature's door
A life known by a few

And those who knew that shared
Their knowledge fewer cared
About what plants could do

For most felt it was mad to conceive
That plants thought, felt, and moved quite like we
But with instruments Bose would devise
Would take Science itself by a surprise, so

On we go to where who knows
To a place where there's still non-believers
What will it take for heaven sakes
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in
It's that same old story again.

Born of slaves who died
Too soon to realize
The need his life would be

Selflessy he gave
His wisdom to a way
Where first no minds would see

He said if farm land was to be rich
We must plant crops to replenish it
But it took him persuasion and tests
To convince them Canver's way was best, so

On we go to where who knows
To a place where there's still non-believers
What will it take for heaven sakes
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in
It's that same old story again.

// Venus' Flytrap And The Bug //

Hello flower
Boy, do you look juicy
And you know just what I'm coming to get, right

Don't eat me
Please don't eat me
I'm trapped in your love
Save me, don't hurt me

// Ai No, Sono //

There is a garden
Where every heart can
Share in the joy of giving

It like no other
Has love to cover
Bearing no price on living

Quietty listen and you might hear them singing their lullaby
Calling for you to join in their love filled garden

Kibo-ni afure
ikiru yorokobi
Shiawase ni michi te
Ai no rakuen
Subete no kokoro ga
Ai o wakachiau
Shizuka ni mimi katamuke yo
Ai no komori uta
Kimi sasoi yobikakenu
Ai no sono

// Power Flower //

Pan is my name
I live outside the door
I have to keep the score of things around you

Fire and air,
water I prepare
I am the piper at the gates of dawning

It's not magic it's not madness
Just the elements I style
And I guarantee faithfully I will never go
Until all is said and done
In a twinkling I'll be gone
Well excuse me I have so much more to do

Fancy I fell,
A childlike tap I'll steal
Look twice my friend it's not the wind at all

You'll never see,
What you refuse to be
The power in the seeing is believing.

It's not magic it's not madness
Just the elements I style
And I guarantee faithfully I will never go
Until all is said and done
In a twinkling I'll be gone
Well excuse me I have so much more to do

It's not magic it's not madness
Just the elements I style
And I guarantee faithfully I will never go
Until all is said and done
In a twinkling I'll be gone
Well excuse me I have so much more to do

// Race Babbling //

This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much to fast
The end's unravelling

Man's production
Life's corruption
World destruct

Help me people
Save you people
God's induction
Life's construction
These instruct
Will save every living thing
Can't you see that
Life's connected
You need us to live
Both we don't need you

This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling

This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much to fast
The end's unravelling
This world is moving much too fast
You can't conceive the nucleus of all
Begins inside a tiny seed
And what you see as insignificant

Man's production
Life's corruption
World destruct

Help me people
Save you people
God's induction
Life's construction
These instruct
Will save every living thing
Can't you see that
Life's connected
You need us to live
Both we don't need you

This world is moving much to fast
This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much to fast
They're space travelling

This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much to fast
The end's unravelling
This world is moving much to fast
This world is moving much to fast
This world is moving much to fast
They're race babbling
This world is moving much to fast
They're space travelling

// Send One Your Love //

Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion

Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love's glory

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

// Outside My Window //

La-La-La-La
La-La-La La-La-La
La-La-La La-La
[repeat 2 times]

Much has been written about
The world and all its kind of loves
But the sweetest of them all
You seldom will find stories of, oh oh oh oh

My love lives outside my window
Clouds burst to give water
So her love can grow, oh
My love smiles to me each morning
Says she'll never leave me and I know it's so

La-La-La-La
La-La-La La-La-La
La-La-La La-La
[repeat 1 times]

You don't have to look around
Or ask yourself if she is there
'Cause the fragrance of her love
Says hi with every breath of air, oh oh oh oh

La-La-La-La
La-La-La La-La-La
La-La-La La-La
[repeat 1 times]

You will often hear her name
Describing another's prettiness
But if ever there was choice 
My flower would be the prettiest, oh oh oh oh

My love lives outside my window
Clouds burst to give water
So her love can grow, oh
My love smiles to me each morning
Says she'll never leave me and I know it's so

La-La-La-La
La-La-La La-La-La
La-La-La La-La
[repeat 6 times]

// Black Orchid //

A flake of snow within a storm
A new way waiting to be born
In a world with need of change
A touch of love in fear of hate
A rushing wind that's asked to wait
For the promises of rain
A pearl of wisdom entrapped by poverty

She gives love with purity
Filling minds with hopeful schemes
To build worlds enhanced by peace
Draped in sparkling morning dew
She expresses life anew
From the earth beneath her feet
She is a flower that grows
In love ability
She's femininity

Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why did they make you begin
When they know in time you'll find your truth
before your cycle ends
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why are you crying their fears
When the true reflection of you that they see
Is love besieged by years

She has touched the farthest star
Her beauty speaks of what we are
And her freedom makes us free
Her now is in eternity
Infinite to all that see
And her dreams have been achieved
Now there is a sound of laughter
Nature signs out her name
For the world to know her fame

Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why did they criticize
When they knew your love could cast its spell and
consecrate their eyes
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why do you linger in space
When you know in every heart that beats
You hold a special place
When you know in every heart that beats
You hold a special place

// Kesse Ye Lolo De Ye //

Kesse Ye Lolo De Ye (A seed's a star)
Lolo Ye Kesse De Ye (A star's a seed)
Diame, Diame (peace and more peace)

// Come Back As A Flower //

The starngest thought came to me on this morning
As I awake to greet the coming dawn
The sun was hardly peaking through the garden
It felt that with everything I was one

Then I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
As a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
To spread the sweetness of love
To spread the sweetness of love

The dew had finished making love to many
A rainbow smelling sweet was in the air
I envied all the silence I saw growing
So unmoved by things outside themselves

Then how I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
As a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
To spread the sweetness of love

How I wished that I could come back as a flower
Oh as a flower
As a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower
As a flower
To spread the sweetness of love
To spread the sweetness of love

Wished that I could come back as a flower

Wished that I could come back as a flower

Sweetness of love

How I come back as a flower

Flower
How I come back as a flower
Flower

Sweetness of love
Sweetness of love

// A Seed's A Star / Tree Medley //

We're a people black as is your night
Born to spread Amma's eternal light
Which since time began
Has been to bring truth to every man

Our ancestors have since long ago
Passed their wisdom down so we to know
For here lies the key
That will help unfold the mistery

A seed's a star
A seed's a star's a seed
A star's a seed
A star's a seed's a star

In myself I do contain
The elements of sun and rain
First a seed with roots that swell
I gradually burst through my shell
Pushing down into the ground
The root of me is homeward bound
A trunk, a leaf and there I am
A miracle of least by far

Tree - you are the longest living one we know
the largest of all plants and still you grow

Tree - within your branches there's such history
so much of what we're searching for to know

Every fifty years we celebrate
Po Tolo, our star, as it rotates
Though infinitely small
It is still the heaviest of them all

[Background]

A seed's a star
A seed's a star's a seed

A star's a seed's a star
A seed's a star
A seed's a star's a seed
A star's a seed
A star's a seed's a star

And some believe antennas are their leaves
That spans beyond our galaxy
They've been, they are and probably will be
Who are the mediocrity

// The Secret Life Of Plants //

I can't conceive the nucleus of all
Begins inside a tiny seed
And what we think as insignificant
Provides the purest air we breathe

But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being
For these are but a few discoveries 
We find inside the Secret Life of Plants

A species smaller than the eye can see
Or larger than most living things
And yet we take from it without consent
Our shelter, food, habilment

But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being
For these are but a few discoveries 
Wwe find inside the Secret Life of Plants

But far too many give them in return 
A stomp, cut, drown, or burn
As is they're nothing
But if you ask yourself where would you be
Without them you will find you would not

And some believe antennas are their leaves
That spans beyond our galaxy
They've been, they are and probably will be
Who are the mediocrity

But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being
For these are but a few discoveries 
We find inside the Secret Life of Plants
For these are but a few discoveries 
We find inside the Secret Life of Plants
