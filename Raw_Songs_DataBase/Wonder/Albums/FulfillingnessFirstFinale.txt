// Smile Please //

A smiling face is an Earth-like star
A frown can't bring out the beauty that you are
Love within and you'll begin smiling...
There're brighter days ahead

Don't mess your face up with bitter tears
'Cause life is gonna be what it is
It's okay, please don't delay from smiling...
There're brighter days ahead

Bum
Bum bum di ti bum
Bum bum di ti bum
Bum bum di ti bum
di ti bum
Bum bum di ti bum
Bum bum di ti bum
Bum bum di ti bum

A smiling face you don't have to see
'Cause it's as joyful as a Christmas tree
Love within and you'll begin smiling...
There're brighter days ahead

Love's not competing it's on your side
You're in life picture so why must you cry
So for a friend please begin to smile - Please
There're brighter days ahead

Bum
Bum bum di ti bum
Bum bum di ti bum
Bum bum di ti bum

Please smile for me

Bum
Bum bum di ti bum
Bum bum di ti bum
Bum bum di ti bum

Please smile for me

Bum - smile

// Heaven Is 10 Zillion Light Years Away //

They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
And just the pure at heart will walk her righteous streets someday
They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
But if there is a God, we need Him now
"Where is your God"
That's what my friends ask me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come... 

Tell me people
Why can't they say that hate is 10 zillion light years away
Why can't the light of good shine God's love in every soul
Why must my color black make me a lesser man
I thought this world was made for every man
He loves us all, that's what my God tells me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come... 

But in my heart I can feel it, yeah,
Feel His spirit wow oh woo...
Feel it, yeah, feel His spirit... 

I... can't say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away
But if so let all be pure at heart
Just to walk her righteous streets I pray
Let God's love shine within to save our evil souls
For those who don't believe will never see the light
"Where is my God" - He lives inside of me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come...
No people, "where is your God?"
Inside please let Him be
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come... 

But if you open your heart you can feel it yeah yeah
Feel His spirit, yeah
Feel it, feel His spirit, wow oh wow...
Feel it, you can feel His spirit
I opened my heart one morning and 
I sho nuff could feel it yeah yeah
Feel His spirit yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can feel it, yeah, feel His spirit
You can feel it, yeah, feel His spirit

// Too Shy To Say //

You make me smile
You make me sing
You make me feel good everything
You bring me up
When I've been down
This only happens when you're around 

And I can't go on this way...
With it stronger every day...
But being too shy to say
That I really love you... 

I wanna fly 
Away with you
Until there's nothing more for us to do 
I wanna be 
More than a friend
Until the end of an endless end 

And I can't go on this way...
With it stronger every day...
But being too shy to say
That I really love you... 

And I can't go on this way...
Feelin' it stronger every day...
But being too shy to say
That I really love you
Ohh.. ooh...
I... do...

// Boogie On Reggae Woman //

// Creeping //

I can hear you sighin'
Sayin' you'll stay beside me
Why must it be
That you always creep...
Into my dreams 

On the beach we're sittin'
Huggin', squeezin', kissin'
Why must it be
That you always creep...
Into my dreams
In my dreams 

When I'm sleep at night babaa
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night babaa...
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy 

Oh, love is so amazing
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah...
Guess you will be stayin'
So let it be
That you always creep...
Into my dreams
In my dreams 

When I'm sleep at night babaa
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night babaa...
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy 

Oh, love is so amazing
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah...
Guess you will be stayin'
So let it be
That you always creep...
Into my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams

// You Haven't Done Nothing //

We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you

But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"You haven't done nothing"!

It's not too cool to be ridiculed 
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else

And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"You haven't done nothing"!

Jackson 5 join along with me say
Doo doo wop - hey hey hey
Doo doo wop - wow wow wow 
Doo doo wop - co co co 
Doo doo wop - naw naw naw
Doo doo wop - bum bum bum 
Doo doo wop

We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
That's becoming real life
But when mislead who knows a person's mind
Can turn as cold as ice un hum

Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"You haven't done nothing"!
Yeah

Jackson 5 sing along again say
Doo doo wop
Doo doo wop - oh
Doo doo wop - co co co 
Doo doo wop - sing it baby
Doo doo wop - bum bum bum 
Doo doo wop - um 
Sing it loud for your people say
Doo doo wop - um um um 

Doo doo wop - stand up be counted, say
Doo doo wop - co co co 
Doo doo wop - ow
Doo doo wop - bum bum bum 
Doo doo wop - ah hum

// It Ain't No Use //

Um um um um
Um um um um 

There ain't no reason for us sittin' down
To try to talk our problems out
'Cause we know the truth,
It ain't no use each other we must do without. 

There ain't no reason tryin' to force a smile
When pain is really in its place
'Cause we know the truth,
It ain't no use let's part before we lose love's trace. 

(We've got to say)
Wow oh oh ooh
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh oh ooh
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh ooh oh ooh wow oh ooh
Wow oh oh oh ooh 

As I look back I'm really try'n to see
Just what it was that made us spark
'Cause the fire's out
It leaves no doubt, the flame's not burning in our hearts. 

We still are young and both of us have time
To find our winter love in spring
Yes we know the truth
It ain't no use, we're not each other's ev'rything. 

(We always must say bye)
Wow oh oh ooh yeah
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh oh ooh yeah
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh ooh oh ooh wow oh ooh
Wow oh oh oh ooh 

(Hate to say goodbye)
Wow oh oh ooh yeah
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh oh ooh yeah
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh ooh oh ooh wow oh ooh
Wow oh oh oh ooh 

(Why we say bye)
Wow oh oh ooh
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
The trill is gone babe, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
I tried my best to make it work
(Wow oh oh oh ooh)
But it seems that we can't get it together, yeah,
(Wow oh ooh) 

We've got to run in the world
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Wow oh oh oh ooh
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Seems that we just don't want tot do it
(Wow oh ooh oh ooh)
I guess we run out of fluid.
(Wow oh ooh) 

Yeah, yeah, yeah wonderful baby, baby, baby
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Don't go, take me baby, don't go baby
(Bye bye bye bye bye)
Ain't no use 'cause we done run out of juice
(Wow oh oh oh ooh)
(Wow oh ooh)
So long baby bye bye baby.

// They Won't Go When I Go //

No more lying friends
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go 

All those bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they won't go when I go 

And I'll go where I've longed
To go so long
Away from tears 

Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him I'll bide
Because they won't go when I go 

Big men feeling small
Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
They won't go when I go 

And I'll go where I've longed
To go so long
Away from tears 

Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He ain't hardly gonna give 

The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
They won't go when I go 

Since my soul conceived
All that I believe
The kingdom I will see
'Cause they won't go when I go 

When I go
Where I'll go
No one can keep me
From my destiny.

// Bird Of Beauty //

Uuh uh
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Ooh oh
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Simon says that now your mind desires a vacation,
Free to join in fun and plenty recreation.
There awaits you a ticket
At Please Have A Good Time Station,
'Cause what is, is gonna stay,
Till ole Father Time decides to change.

Simon says that your mind is requesting furlough,
Let it find the answers to things
That you've always wanted to know.
There's a tour of many places
That you've always wanted to go,
And to me that sure sounds best
'Cause it means happiness for you.

There is so much in life for you to feel
Unfound in white, red, or yellow pills.
A mind excursion can be such a trill,
You please satisfy,
Take a chance and ride
The bird of beauty of the sky.

Do do do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do do

Tudo bem voce deve descannar a sua mente,
Nao faz mal o qu vai acontecer daqui pra fente.
Vai cantar alegria.......
Voce coracao assim tao feliz ja vai cantar carnaval.

There is so much in life for you to feel
Unfound in white, red, or yellow pills.
A mind excursion can be such a trill,
You please satisfy,
Take a chance and ride
The bird of beauty of the sky.

Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do (The bird of beauty of the sky)

Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do (The bird of beauty of the sky)
