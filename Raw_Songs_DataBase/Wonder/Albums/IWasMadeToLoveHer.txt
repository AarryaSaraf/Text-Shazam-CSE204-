Album: IWasMadeToLoveHer

// I Was Made To Love Her //

I was born in Lil' Rock,
Had a childhood sweetheart,
We were always hand in hand.

I was hightop shoes and shirt tails,
Suzy was in pig tails,
I know I loved her even then.

You know my papa disapproved it,
My mama boohooed it,
But I told them time and time again,
"Don't you know I was made to love her,
Built a world all around her"
Yah! Hey, hey, hey.

She's been my inspiration,
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years.

Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossmed tenderly,
My life grew sweeter through the years.

I know that my baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
That's why we made it through the years.

I was made to love her,
Worship and adore her,
Hey, hey, hey.

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end,
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!

My baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
And I know I ain't going nowhere.

I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me,
I had the fever with each passing year.

Oh, even if the mountain tumbles,
If this whole world crumbles,
By her side I'll still be standing there.

'Cause I was made to love her,
I was made to live for her, yeah!

Ah, I was made to love her,
Built my world all around her,
Hey, hey, hey.

Oo baby, I was made to please her,
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no,
Hey, hey, hey.

Oo wee baby, my baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
Hey, hey, hey.

OO my baby loves me....

// Send Me Some Lovin' //

Send me some loving
Send it I pray
How can I love you
When you?re far away?

Oh, send me your picture
Send it my dear
So I can hold it
Pretend you are near
Can't you send me your kisses?

I can feel their touch
I need you so badly
I miss you so much

My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waiting for you

Can?t you send me your kisses?
I can feel their touch
I miss you so badly
I need you so much

My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waiting for you

// I'd Cry //

I'd cry
If you leave me sad and blue
I'd cry
If you ever say we're through
I'd cry
If it can't be me and you
Lonely tears I'd shed
I'd hang my head

I'd cry
Like a little bitty babe
I'd cry
If you ever walked away
I'd cry
If you call it a day
I'd cry for years
I'd drown in tears

Oh sugar baby I love you so
I need you more than you know
And if I ever had to let you go
I'd sit around I'd break right down

I'd cry
Deep down in my heart
I'd cry
If you leave me tears would start
I'd cry
Everyday that we're apart
I'd cry a river
Don't you leave me ever

Baby you release in me
Flame of love burns within me
I'd be sad as I can be
If I had to do without you

I'd cry
If you ever put me down
I'd cry
If you ever play around
I'd cry
It will fall to the ground
I'd fall apart
If you break my heart

Oh, I love you love you
More than words can say
Love you more and more each day
If you ever ever walk away
I couldn't go on
I'd sit at home

I'd cry
Like a little bitty babe
I'd cry
If you ever walked away
I'd cry
If you call it a day
I'd cry for years
I'd drown in tears

I'd cry
If you leave me sad and blue
I'd cry
If you ever say we're through
I'd cry

// Everybody Needs Somebody (I Need You) //

Life on your own, don't really make you free
You can't put your arms around a memory
A little bit of soul, is worth more than gold

Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
I need you

The lonely days and nights were paved with dreams
I've loved and lost and I do believe
A little bit of soul, is worth more than gold

Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
I need you

Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
Everybody, needs somebody
I need you

We got to get together babe

// Respect //

What you want, baby, I got.
What you need, you know I got it.
All I askin' is for a little respect
When you come home, baby.
When you come home,
Respect.

I ain't gonna do you wrong while you gone,
I ain't gonna do you wrong 'cause I don't wanna.
All I askin' is for a little respect
When you come home, baby.
When you come home,
Respect.

I'm out to give you all my money
But all I'm askin in return, honey,
Is to give me my proper respect
When you get home, yeah baby,
When you get home.
Ooh, your kisses sweeter than honey
But guess what, so here's my money.
All I want you to do for me is give me some here
When you get home, yeah baby,
When you get home.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T,
Find out what it means to me.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T,
Hey Boy, T-C-B.
A little respect ...

// My Girl //

I've got sunshine, on a cloudy day...
When its cold outside, I've got the month of May.
I'd guess you'd say,
What can make me feel this way?
My girl,
My girl,
My girl,
Talking bout my girl.
My girl!
I've got so much honey the bees envy me.
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees.
Well I'd guess you'd say,
What can make me feel this way?
My girl,
My girl,
My girl,
Talking bout my girl.
My girl!
I don't need nobody,
Oh just my baby.
I've got all the riches baby,
One man can claim.
I'd guess you'd say,
What can make me feel this way?
My girl,
My girl,
My girl,
Talking bout my girl.
My girl!

// Baby Don't You Do It //

Don't you do it, don't break my heart,
Oh Babe, don't you do it, don't
Don't break my heart
Don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart

'Cause I sacrifice to make you happy
Get nothin' for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I believe, baby, you'd better keep on keepin' on
Girl, I try to do my best
Girl, I try to do my best, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, oh don't do it baby
Don't break my heart

My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much
And lettin' you know
'Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you're gonna let me go
My heart was made glad when you strolled, you see
Heartaches and misery you've been causin' me
Girl, I try to do my best
Girl, I try to do my best
Don't you do it, don't break my heart
Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see by me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart; can't you see I need you?
I'm no good without you, can't go on without you
Life's no good without you, what'm I gonna do without you?
Baby don't do it, don't you break my heart
Don't you do it, baby, don't you break my heart
What'm I gonna do without you?
Got to go on, baby
Baby don't you do it

// A Fool For You //

I know you told me
Such a long time ago
Oh that you didn't want me girl
You didn't love me no more

I want to know
Oh, what makes me love you the way i do
Like a fool for you
I say, I'm a fool for you

I know you told me
You didn't want me `round
But I know girl
You got a man way `cross town

So I know it's something
Oh, what makes me love you the way i do
Must be that I'm a fool for you
Such a fool for you

Did you ever wake up in the morning
Just about the break of day
Nothing on your mind
But love love sweet love
Where your baby used to lay
Then you put on your crying
Like you never cried before
Even cry so loud, yeah
You give the blues to your neighbor next door
Ever since you were five years old
I been a fool for you, little girl
Way down in my soul
I'm a little fool for you

So I know it's something
Oh, oh, Lord
I'm a fool for you

// Can I Get A Witness //

Ah ah listen everybody, specially you girls
Is it right to be left alone when the one you love is never home
I love too hard my friends sometimes say
But I believe I believe that a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside to see you treat me so unkind
Somebody somewhere tell her it ain't fair
Can I get a witness
I want a witness
Somebody
I want a witness
Is it right to be treated so bad when you give her everything you had
Keep on talking in my sleep 'cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now you kids you all agree is that the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Took to find it out all night I been cryin'
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
I'm gonna stick by hr till the very end
Well she causes so much misery how's a gal supposed to be
Somebody somewhere tell her it ain't right
Can I get a witness, can I get a witness
I want a witness
Somebody
Can I get a witness
Everybody knows especially you girls
That a love can be sad but my beloved's twice as bad
Now you kids do all agree that ain't the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
I want a witness
I want a witness
Yeah, I want a witness
Somebody
Is it right to be treated so bad when you give her everything you had
Keep on talking in my sleep 'cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now you kids you all agree is that the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
I want a witness...
