// Castles In The Sand //

Mmm
On the beach where young lovers meet
You can see them there as they sit and build
Castles in the sand

Heavenly she's so heavenly
When she smiles at you
And she helps you build castles in the sand

The time comes when you stop pretending
For all dreams must come to an ending
Remember what happens to castles of sand
The sea will wash them away

Oh
And the beach where they used to meet
By the sand and sea waves have washed away

Castles in the sand
Castles in the sand
Where did they go
Castles in the sand
Tell me, where did they go
Castles in the sand
I wanna know where did they go

// Ebb Tide //

First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea

And the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide

With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace

I can tell, I can feel
You are love, you are real

Really mine
In the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web
Of your arms

// Sad Boy //

On the beach I build a castle
Out of loneliness and sand
I'm the saddest boy I know
Just had to build me a wonderland
'Cause when you came by hand in hand
With another guy
I just could not stop those big tears
Falling from my eyes

The high tides coming in
Oh no no I can't stand to see my kingdom end
The boys laughed at me and said
Oh sad boy never be lovers by the sand

The tide came rushing in
Took my poor castle out to the sea
If the ocean be that strong
Well then that's where I wanna be

When she reads in the paper
That this same sad boy has drowned
Will she laugh with him
And say "That funny clown"

// Happy Street //

Ah ha Yeah
Everybody come on yeah yeah clap your hands
Come on and clap your hands
Stomp your feet
Get with the rhythm of happy street
'Cause that's my street, happy street

// The Party At The Beach House //

We're gonna have a party at the beach house
Everybody's gonna have a good time

We're gonna have a party at the beach house

Waiting for summer to get back now

Everybody's gonna have a good time they got to

// Beachstomp //

There is a dance that they do on the beach, yeah
It's called the beach stomp
And it's done with the feet, yeah
Well you kick just a little sand
Then you grab your partner by the hand

Catch a wave on the run
You're doing the beachstomp, yeah

Place your surf
Down to your side
They catch a big wave
Then begin to ride, yeah
But you grab a real tight grip
Get ready for the great big dip

Come on yeah and do the beachstomp with me
Yeah Yeah ah Yeah

Now the boys are there
With their transistor radios
And all of the girls
Are in their polka dot bikinis

If you wanna swing until two
I'll tell you what you can do
Grab a chick by the hand
And do the beachstomp

Now there is a dance that they do on the beach, yeah
It's called the beach stomp
And it's done with the feet, yeah
Well you kick just a little sand
Then you grab your partner by the hand

Everybody come on yeah yeah yeah
Do the beachstomp with me yeah yeah...

// Beyond The Sea //

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailin'

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailin'

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailin'

I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet (I know we'll meet) beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailin'
