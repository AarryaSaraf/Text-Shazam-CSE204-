// Too High //

Dodo do do do dodo 
Do do dodo do dodo 
Dodo dodo do do 

Dodo do do do dodo 
Do do do do dodo do 
Dodo dodo dodo 

I'm too high 
I'm too high 
But I ain't touched the sky 

I'm too high 
I'm too high 
But I ain't touched the sky 

She's a girl in a dream 
She sees a four-eyed cartoon monster 
On the T.V. screen 
She takes another puff and says 
"It's a crazy scene" 
That red is green 
And she's a tangerine 

I'm too high 
I'm too high 
But I ain't left the ground 

I'm too high 
I'm too high 
I hope I never ever come down 

She's the girl in her life 
But her world's a superficial paradise 
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice 
But no dice 
She wasn't very nice 

Ooh 

Dodo do do do dodo 
Do do dodo do dodo 
Do do do do do do 

Dodo do do do dodo 
Do do dodo do dodo 
Dodo dodo 
Dodo dodo 
Dodo dodo 

I'm too high 
I'm too high 
I'm so high 
I feel like I'm about to die 

I can't ever touch the sky 

I'm too high 
She's a girl of the past 
I guess that I got to her at last 
A did you hear the news about the girl today 
She passed away 
What did her friend say 

They said she's too high 
Too high 
Can't hang around anyway... 

Dodo do do do dodo 
Do do dodo do dodo 
do...do...do... 
do...do...do... 
do...

// Visions //

People hand in hand 
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land ? 
Where hate's a dream and love forever stands 
Or is this a vision in my mind ? 

The law was never passed 
But somehow all men feel they're truly free at last 
Have we really gone this far through space and time 
Or is this a vision in my mind ? 

I'm not one who makes believe 
I know that leaves are green 
They only change to brown when autumn comes around 
I know just what I say 
Today's not yesterday 
And all things have an ending 

But what I'd like to know 
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful 
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away 
To the vision in our mind ? 

I'm not one who makes believes 
I know that leaves are green 
They only change to brown when autumn comes around 

I know just what I say 
Today's not yesterday 
And all things have an ending 

But what I'd like to know 
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful 
Or do we have to take our wings and fly away 
To the vision in our minds ?

// Golden Lady //

Looking in your eyes 
Kind of heaven eyes 
Closing both my eyes 
Waiting for surprise 
To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far 
Cause I'm not afraid to try and go it 
To know the love and the beauty never known before 
I'll leave it up to you to show it 

And golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there 
Golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there 
Take me right away 

Looking at your hands 
Hands can understand 
Waiting for the chance 
Just to hold your hand 
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow 
Into a lovely smile that's blooming 
And it's so clear to me that you're a dream come true 
There's no way that I'll be losing 

And golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there 
Golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there 
Take me right away 

A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow 
Into a lovely smile that's blooming 
And it's so clear to me that you're my dream come true 
There is no way that I'll be losing 

Golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there 
Golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there

// All In Love Is Fair //

All is fair in love
Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say

But all is changed with time
The future none can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery

But all is fair in love
I had to go away

A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay

But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The losing side I'll play

But all is fair in love
I should've never left your side

A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

// Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing //

Everybody's got a thing 
But some don't know how to handle it 
Always reachin' out in vain 
Accepting the things not worth having but 

Don't you worry 'bout a thing 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama 
Cause I'll be standing on the side 
When you check it out 

They say your style of life's a drag 
And that you must go other places 
But just don't you feel too bad 
When you get fooled by smiling faces but 

Don't you worry 'bout a thing 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama 
Cause I'll be standing on the side 
When you check it out...Yeah 
When you get it off...your trip 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing...Yeah 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing...Yeah 

Don't you worry 'bout a thing 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama 
Cause I'll be standing on the side 
When you check it out... 
When you get it off...your trip 

Everybody needs a change 
A chance to check out the new 
But you're the only one to see 
The changes you take yourself through 

Don't you worry 'bout a thing 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama 
Cause I'll be standing in the wings 
When you check it out 

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
