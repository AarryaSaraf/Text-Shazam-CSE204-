Album: DownToEarth

// A Place In The Sun //

Like a long lonely stream
I keep runnin' towards a dream
Movin' on, movin' on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reachin' to be free
Movin' on, movin' on

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Movin' on, movin' on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rollin' since my birth
Movin' on, movin' on

There's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember

Yes, there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone...

// Bang Bang //

She was five and I was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black and she wore white
She would always win the fight

Bang bang she shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
I grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang I shot you down
Bang bang you hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang I used to shoot you down

The music played and people sang
And just for me the church bells rang

Hey!
Bang bang bang bang
Hey!
Bang bang bang bang
Hey!
Bang bang bang bang
Yeah!
Bang bang bang bang

Now she's gone I don't know why
'Till this day some times I cry
She didn't even say goodbye
She didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang she shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down

// Down To Earth //

Down to earth once again
I've been away too long
I got lost but then I came home again
Oh where I belong

Down to earth just in time
To the love I failed to see
I gave up the dream for a change of scene
Now I'm back where I should be

Down to earth, down to earth
All that I lost I have found
What's it worth this bitter earth
Whithout your love around

I got lost in the crowd
That's the price I had to pay
Cause I couldn't find what I left behind
Till love showed me the way

Down to earth down to earth
All that i lost i have found
What's it worth this bitter earth
Without your love around

Welcome home little fool
And it's been a long hard time
From a world unreal to the things I feel
Well love was waiting all the time

Down to earth,down to earth
Down, Down to earth

// Thank You Love //

Thank you love
You made me happy in so many ways
Through all my sweet and ender yesterdays
You were the sunshine I needed love

You were there
You warmed my heart when troubled skies would come
You were my one and only faithful one
I wanna really really thank you love

Thank you love
With all my heart and soul I thank you love
Each day that comes and goes I thank you love
I thank you 'cause you gave me true love

I was lost
Somewhere along life's road I was lost
And on that lonesome road our bridges crossed
You showed me the way to tender love

It's a miracle
Just like the sunshine makes the flower grow
That's just the way you change my whole life show
Through the sunshine of your tender love

Thank you love
With every breath I take I thank you love
With every new day break I thank you love
I thank you 'cause you gave me true love

Oh my darling, When I'm down
You'll gently squeeze these hands of mine
And I feel just like a child at Christmas time
'cause I could feel the nearness of your love

Oh my darling I've been blessed
A precious thing is this that I possess
Could fill this heart on mine with happiness
I wanna really really thank you love

Oh my baby thank you love
With all my heart and soul I thank you love
Each day that comes and goes I thank you love
I thank you 'cause you gave me true true love
Thank you, thank you, thank you

// Be Cool, Be Calm (And Keep Yourself Together) //

Girl I've been crying ever since you left
My mama told me get a hold of yourself and
Be Cool, Be Calm And Keep Yourself Together
She said
Be Cool, Be Calm And Keep Yourself Together

Sugar plum you really gone
And it just don't help to cry
So I wipe my tears away the other day
And hung my handkerchief up to dry

Then I changed my style put on a smile
And went out to face the world
The smile I wear say ha I don't care
That I just lost my girl

But I still get that old yearning
Can't be cool when my heart is burning
I still get that old feeling
Can't be calm when my head is reeling

I say, Mother dear, see here see here
Tell me now what shall I do
Can't have that girl and I love her true
She said but babes give up be man enough

To Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together
That what my mama said
Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together

Sugar pie you said goodbye
And I cried myself to sleep
That's when my mama said
Don't loose your head son
It just don't help to weep

Now I'm the great pretender
I don't surrender
To what I feel inside
I'm the life of the crowd
And ha I love fun lots
But it's a big disguise

'Cause I still hear my heart pounding
Hard to be cool when you come around me
I still hear my heart purring
Hard to ne calm when my inside's stirring

I say, Mother dear, see here see here
Tell me now what way to go
Can't have that girl and I love her so
She said whenever you're blue whatever you do

Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together
That what my mama said
Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together
Maintain yourself

// Sylvia //

Whoa, oh, oh, yeah
Mmm, hmm Sylvia
You know you're getting to me now
Mmm, mmm, mmm, Sylvia
You gently touched my heart somehow

Yesterday you made me happy as a child at play
Just like the summer sun that warms my heart
And move on, now you are gone

Whoa, oh, oh, Sylvia
You're everything that I adore
That sweet song, that caught a spark in me more
Tenderly that's how you whisper that you loved me
As if a raindrop kissed my ear and disappeared, now you are gone

Oh, oh, oh, yeah
You know I love my little Sylvia

Whoa, oh, oh, yeah
And yesterday I feel in love with you all the way
Tenderly you lit a spark in my heart, now you are gone

Mmm, hmm, Sylvia
I gently miss Sylvia
I'm crazy 'bout ya, Sylvia
You know I love my little Sylvia

// My World Is Empty Without You //

My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe

And as I go my way alone,
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strength, I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much

My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe

From this whole world, I try to hide my face
But from this loneliness, there's no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness with memories I know so well

I need your love more than before
I can hardly carry on anymore

My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe

My mind and soul have felt like this
Since love between us, no more exists
And each time that darkness falls,
It finds me alone with these four walls

My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe

Without you, babe, without you, babe

// The Lonesome Road //

Look down, look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on

Look up, look up
And seek your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn

I'm weary of toting, such a heavy load
Trudging down, that lonesome road

Look down, look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on

I'm weary of toting, such a heavy load
Trudging down, that lonesome road

Look down, look down
Look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on

True love, true love
What have I done
Tell me what have I done
That you should treat me so

You - caused me
Yes you caused me
To walk and talk
Like I never did before

I'm weary of toting, such a heavy load
Trudging down, that lonesome road

Look down, look down
Look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on

// Angel Baby (Don't You Ever Leave Me) //

Could ever steal you away from me

My little angel baby

// Mr. Tambourin Man //

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet and the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'
I'm ready to go anywhere I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Though you might hear laughin' spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing

And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind it's just a shadow you're seein' that he's chasing

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow

Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

// Sixteen Tons //

Some folks say a man is made out of mud
But a poor man's made out of muscle and blood
muscle and blood, skin and bones
a mind that's weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born when the sun didn't shine
I became a man who who would work the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
The foreman said: "well, a-bless my soul"

I was born in drizzling rain
Fighting and Trouble was my middle name
When I come around, you better step aside
A lot of man didn't and a lot man died (Yes they did)

You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store. (Yes sing it one time with me)

Sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

// Hey Love //

Hey love
May I have a word with you?
I'd like to tell you, yeah
Just what I've been going through
My nights are so long
As I watch each hour go by
Hoping and praying
That someday I will be your guy

Hey love
You're my one true soul desire
Hey love, baby
Can you feel this burning fire

Hey love
There's one thing I find so true
When you are near me
I go through a change or two
Hearing your footsteps
I hurry to catch your eye
And I stand there waiting, yeah
But girl, you just walk on by

Say love
With a cold heart you are dealing
Hey love, yeah
It's an awful hurting feeling

Hey love
Don't pass me without some sign
Just look me over, yeah
You might want to change your mind
