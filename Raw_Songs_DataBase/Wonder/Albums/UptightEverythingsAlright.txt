// Hold Me //

Hold me darling hold me 
And I'll always be your, be your guy 
Closer, baby come closer 
Let me be the one that loves and be by your side 

Why should you be lonely when I need you so 
Give my arms a chance I know I'll never let go 
So hold me, baby hold me 
Say you'll never let me go 

Why should you be lonely when I need you so 
Give my arms a chance I know I'll never let go 
So hold me, baby hold me 
Say you'll never let me go 

You know I love you so 

I'll never-never let you go 
I'll never let you go 

Oh baby-baby, hold me 
Why should we be apart 

I'll never-never let you go

// Blowin' In The Wind //

How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the canon balls fly before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind. 

How many years must a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind. 

How many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind. 
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

// Nothing's Too Good For My Baby //

Hey!
Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)

I'm the luckiest guy in the world
'Cause I've got one pearl of a girl
For my baby I work part-time
Down at the neighborhood five-and-dime
Half of my money goes to buy her
Some of the things her little heart desires
The other half goes dime by dime
To show my cookie a real good time, because

Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)

She's sweet and she's kind
And she tells me that she's mine all mine, now
Ain't that lovin', ain't that livin'
Ain't that half the fun of givin'

Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)

I walk around with my chest stuck out
'Cause my baby's worth bragging about
Every Johnnie, Jack, and Jim
Wished that she belonged to him
I gave up the old gang of mine
'Cause with my girl goes all my time
One of these days I'm gonna buy her a ring
And marry her - and everything, because

Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)

She's sweet and she's mellow
And she tells me that I'm one heck of a fellow, now
Ain't that lovin', ain't that livin'
Ain't that half the fun of givin'

Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl

She's all right and out of sight
And I love her ah-ha-ha, yeah ah-ah-ha-ha-ha ha
Ah-ha-ha yeah, I'm gonna get her a diamond ring, everything

// Teach Me Tonight //

Did you say,
I've got a lot to learn.
Well don't think,
I'm trying not to learn.
Since this is the perfect spot to learn.
Teach me tonight.

Starting with,
The abc of it.
Right down to,
The xyz of it.
Help me solve the mystery of it.
Teach me tonight.

The sky's a blackboard,
High above you.
If a shooting star goes by.
I'll use that star.
To write I love you, a thousand times across the sky.

One thing isn't very clear,
My love.
Should the teacher stand so near, my love.
Graduation's almost here,
My love.
Teach me tonight.

I'll use that star.
To write I love you,
A thousand times across the sky.

One thing isn't very clear,
My love.
Should the teacher stand so near,
My love.
Graduation's almost here,
My love.

So would you,
Teach me tonight.
I've lost all fear,
My love.

// Uptight (Everything's Alright) //

Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight.
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight.

I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad track,
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back,
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye.

When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suits are out of style,
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true.

She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.

She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say,
I guess her folks brought her up that way,
The right side of tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids.

She says no one is better than I,
I know I'm just an average guy,
No football hero or smooth Don Juan,
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son.

Can't give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never, never make my baby cry,

And it's all right, what I can't do,
Out of sight because my heart is true,
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, ah ah ah ah,
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.

// Ain't That Asking For Trouble //

Ain't that asking for trouble
Now ain't that asking for trouble

Baby you remind me of a pretty rose
That's awfully painful to my touch
And though there's thorns underneath the rose
Baby you hurt twice as much

You made me cry a thousand times, ha
And leaving me with a broken heart
I should stand many miles away
But I'm right here in your arms

Now ain't that asking for trouble

Baby the way I'm at your beck and call
I must be hypnotised
'Cause I, I know I've got sense enough to know
That loving you ain't wise

Sure as the sun may shine
My heart will be in pain
Like a child that's seen papa
I'm in your arms again

Now ain't that asking for trouble

Baby I, I can't stop my loving you
Until you hurt me so much
My plans not to see you again
Baby but your tender touch
I guess I'm just too weak for you
I shoulda been so long gone
But here I'm in your arms again
And I'm still holding on

Now ain't that asking for trouble

// I Want My Baby Back //

Ow...
Tossing and turning all night long
My girl is gone, can't take it
I'm trying to conceal the loneliness I feel
But it's real, can't fake it
The pain in my heart is tearing me apart
Her memory, can't shake it
I tried to tell myself to find somebody else
But my heart, won't make it

Ah ah, I need love and that's natural fact
And more than anything I want my baby back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)

(I, want my baby back)
She's the only girl that brightens up my world
What can I say, don't make her do it
She's fine as can be and was so good to me
I had a good thing, and I blew it
Now I'm all alone, the love we had is gone
What can I do, to renew it
If I only had a chance to continue our romance
I wouldn't hesitate, to get to it

Ah ah, I need love and that's natural fact
And more than anything I want my sugar back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
Ah ah ah, ah ah yeah
(I, want my baby back)

Ah ah ah, ah ah I need love and that's a natural fact
And more than anything I want my baby back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
Ah ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah I, want my baby back
My heart is aching, think it's breaking
Ah ah, ah ah I want my baby back
My world is lonely, need her only
Everybody sing I want my baby back now
(I want my baby back)
Ha ha ha, ha ha I, want my baby back
My heart is sadly...

// Pretty Little Angel //

Angel a pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel

Wish you knew just how I felt about you
Wish you felt the same way as I do
I can bring you love if you just open up your heart
Little girl I'm so in love with you

If you ever tell me that you love me
If you ever show me that you care
I will be so proud to have you
Standing by my side
Little girl I'm so in love with you

We'll be so happy together
We'll build a heaven of our own
And darling, if you just play your part
And let me steal your heart
I know I'll have your love for ever

Angel for your love I have been praying
Hoping someday you will look my way
I can make you mine if you just open up your eyes
Little girl I'm so in love with you

A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
Oh my
A pretty little angel
My, my my
A pretty little angel

// Music Talk //

Yeah, ah
Ah the language of music
Is known around the world
It's the language that's understood
By people everywhere
(Yes everywhere)

Soon you'll hear the trumpets begin to blow
Ah listen to the trombones playing way down low
Well everybody seems to be playing
With a lot of soul
Fellas so you mind if I join in and play along

Everybody yeah

Just a little bit of drum

Ahh I think the drummer has found a new groove
Listen close and you will hear the saxophone move

If you're feelin' what you hearing well don't you know
Yeah, ah it's just the music that friendly music talking
To your soul

It can make you blue or make you feel so glad
It's best way of talking that man has ever had

Everybody around the world sing with me now

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

// With A Child's Heart //

With a child's heart
Go face the worries of the day
With a child's heart
Turn each problem into play
No need to worry no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear

With a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You've got no reason to frown
Love is as welcome
As a sunny sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray

Take life easy, so easy nice and easy
Like a child so gay and so carefree
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me down
