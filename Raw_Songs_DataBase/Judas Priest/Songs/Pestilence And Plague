The storms from the gods make us
Perish with hunger
Starvation and drought
Are unleashed on this earth
Reap what you sow
From your greed and our treasures
Far more than we need
Now far more than we're worth


Nella tentazione
Cercando la gloria
Il prezzo da pagare
E' la caduta dell'uomo


In temptation
Seeking for glory
The price to pay
Is the fall of mankind

How can we live in despair and in sorrow?
Our children are lost
With all that we love
Plague spreading forth
To lay waste to our culture
Civilization's demise from above



This world revolves and I foretell
The end of man resides in hell
For you can see that in my heart
We will depart



Nella tentazione (Into temptation)
Cercando la gloria (In search of glory)
Il prezzoda pagare (The price we pay)
E'la caduta dell'uomo (The fall of man)
