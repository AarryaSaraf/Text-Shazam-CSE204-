They never broke my will
Cause my heart was strong
They won't justify
Condemnation, my vindication
But I will survive

Stood my ground 'till the end
Engaged the enemy protect my friends

Nostradamus 
Nostradamus 


Tamed the beast
They sent to kill
The congregation never broke my will

Nostradamus 
Nostradamus 


He has overcome
He can take the throne

Nostradamus; vindication
Nostradamus; is avenged

Nostradamus; our salvation
Nostradamus; he's avenged

I walked through fire to justify
Their inquisitions all condemned to die

Nostradamus 
Nostradamus 


Adversity on which I thrived
Destroys the altar now I'm vilified

Nostradamus 
Nostradamus 


He has seized the day
He is here to stay

Nostradamus; vindication
Nostradamus; is avenged

Nostradamus; our salvation
Nostradamus; he's avenged

Vindication,
He has been avenged

They never broke my will
Because my heart was strong
They can't justify
I will survive

He has overpowered
It's his finest hour

Nostradamus; vindication
Nostradamus; is avenged

Nostradamus; our salvation
Nostradamus; he's avenged

Nostradamus 
Nostradamus 
Nostradamus 
Nostradamus
