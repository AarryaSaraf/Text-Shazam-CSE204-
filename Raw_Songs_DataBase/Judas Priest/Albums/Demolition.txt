Album: Demolition

// Rapid Fire //

[Recorded with Ripper Owens]

Pounding the world
Like a battering ram
Forging the furnace
For the final grand slam

Chopping away at the source
Soon the course will be done

Leaving a trail of destruction
That's second to none

Hammering anvils
Screaming muscle and might
Shattering blows
Crashing row beating fright

Fast devastating and
Desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of
Truth through each man
Of this earth

Wielding the axe
Comes the one culmination
That's always seemed
Certain to bring down the curtain on greed

Sifting the good from the bad
It's the age for the rage of the
Dogs which must fall to the just
And be free

Now grate for the vandals
Who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned
Brought forth demolition to war

The slipping and sl iding
Corrosive subsiding
That withered and waned
Till the world seemed all drained
Fills the bay

Pounding the world
Like a battering ram
Forging the furnace
For the final grand slam

Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction
That's second to none
Second to none

// Machine Man //

[G. Tipton]

Licensed to kill
On my 650 Bonneville
"Hellfire" we yell
Fueled and indestructible

Get it down
To take the crown
Neon daze
Renegades

No fear just hate
Drives us to the ultimate
Cut loose extremes
On our maniac machines

Take me down
Or hit the ground
Neon nights
At the speed of light

So you motherfuckers want to race
You've all got loser tattooed on your face

Machine Man's running - you wanna try
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die

Ignite the engines
You can hear it scream
You're gonna eat your words
That challenged this machine

The beast is revved up
The flag is down
The tyres screech
And lay a smoke screen all around

Through the limits
As they rocket past
It's a blood bath
There's no second place

Machine Man's running - you wanna try
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die

Machine Man - Machine Man's coming
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming

Ice nerves of steel
As I notch another kill
You lose - I win
I get to ride again

Get it down
Hit the ground
Neon nights
Speed of light

Feel no mercy as I cross the line
Watch the suckers self-destruct behind

Machine Man's running
You wanna try
Machine Man's coming
You're gonna die

Machine Man's running - you wanna try
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die

Machine Man - Machine Man's coming
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming

// One On One //

[G. Tipton, K.K. Downing]

I am your darkest hour
I am your fall from power
I am the voice you dread and I'm
Screaming out inside your head

I am the final count
I am your demons out
I am the worst demise
I'm gonna cut your big words down to size

What is this?
I hear you shout
Face to face
I'm gonna take you out

One on one, bring it on
One on one, take me on

I am the awful truth
I am the fearless youth
I am the cross to bear
And the one who dares to return your stare

I am the fist of God
I am the underdog
I'll always stand my ground
While the others scatter all around

Against all odds
Daespite it all
I'm at my best when I'm against the wall

One on one, bring it on
One on one, take me on

I am the bloodstained past at last
That's finally caught up with you like
The glint of steel from out of the dark the last
Thing you will feel - I'm outgunned, I'm out

Run, I'm undead and then I found the skin
You shed - I am the questions asked
That send the shivers down your back

So I am holding out
And I'm much stronger now
So take me on

One on one, bring it on
One on one, take me on

I am the darkest night
I am the viper's strike
I'll see you all consumed
As you start to lick your mortal wounds

Like the condemned man
Who just won't die
I'll show no remorse
I'll never walk away

One on one, bring it on
One on one, take me on

// Hell Is Home //

[G. Tipton, K.K. Downing]

You're looking at me why
Sort of like a leper vibe
Okay for your kind
But it's too good for me

And a hey I know I'm
Never gonna qualify
For all the bullshit
Of your social degrees

Oh look down your noses at me
Hating my identity
Oh but that don't mean a damn thing you see
'Cause down here in Hell everybody loves me

Hey I know I'm anti-social
'Cause you act like I'm infected
With some atrocity

And though I know I'm
Every bit the same inside
My face don't fit
It's like I've got some disease

Oh you keep your face turned away
To strip me of identity
Oh still got my fortune and fame
'Cause down here in Hell everyone knows my name

Hell is home to me
Might as well be
I like it here and nowhere else invited me
Hell is home to me
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ)
Nobody else invited me

Now I belong
I found my home
'Cause even though I know things won't
Get any better, they can certainly never get much worse

Hell is home to me
Might as well be
I like it here and nowhere else invited me
Hell is home to me
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ)
Nobody else invited me

Say my whole life I've always been disliked
Ignored unless you're spitting insults at me
And I don't know why you felt so justified
In all the degradation that you dished on me

Oh!  Now my status has changed
And you've got yourself to blame
Oh!  I'll grab all the attention I crave
Now I'm running Hell - Heaven won't be the same

Hell is home to me
Might as well be
I like it here and nowhere else invited me
Hell is home to me
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ)
Nobody else invited me

// Feed On Me //

[G. Tipton]

They are dying on the dance floor
They are lying in debris
They are fading with exhaustion
From the mortal injuries

They are hungry and need feeding
They've resigned themselves to fate
They are desperate men
Death's written on their face

When your will to live
Is all but gone
And you're left alone
But you need someone - feed on me
Feed on me

They're outgunned and they're outnumbered
But they'll never turn to run
And the "In the name of freedom's"
Written with their blood

Some would call them mercenary
But they always knew the pain
Inevitably far outweighs the gain

Feed on me
Feed on me if you need to breathe
Feed on me
When your hunger strikes you down again
And you feel your inner strength has drained - feed on me
Feed on me

Feed on me - I got what you need
Feed on me
Feed on me - don't accept defeat

They are dying on the dance floor
They are lying in debris
They are fading with exhaustion
From the mortal injuries

Some would call them mercenary
But they always knew the pain
Inevitably far outweighs the gain

When your will to live has almost gone
And you're left alone and you need someone
Feed on me
Feed on me

Feed on me
Feed on me - I got what you need
Feed on me
Feed on me - don't accept defeat

// Jekyll And Hyde //

[G. Tipton]

Your innocence all but fades
When we peel the veneer away
It's all an act which you stage
With your two-faced barricades

Rage consumes
You every night
Caged inside you
Trying to get out

Schizophrenic basic needs
Fools me into complacency
But now I see through your facade
Behind the mask a monster snarls

Hatred burning
In your chest
Dazed but learning
In your quest

Oh it's killing me your unpredictability
Oh all the time
You hide behind
Your Jekyll and Hyde

Now I realize
There's a dark side
Disguised

Always changing
Then love hating
Baiting me

Your innocence all but fades
When we peel the veneer away
It's all an act which you stage
With your two-faced barricades

Rage consumes you every night
Caged inside you trying to get out

Oh it's killing me your unpredictability
Oh all the time
You hide behind
Your Jekyll and Hyde

// Devil Digger //

[G. Tipton]

I was cross-wired underground
Nothing seemed to fit
I was fried and memory bound
Then it came to me

Devil digger
Unforgiver

I was on a different plane
He said come to me
Laid his hands upon my brow
That's the last of me

Devil digger
Unbeliever

Don't be sorry
It's no disgrace
But never worry (unless)
You have no faith

See him coming
He has no face
You must stop running
You must have faith

Death's not final so were told
Words are so profound
Who the hell wants to get old
But ask in the final hours

Devil digger - unbeliever
Devil digger - unforgiver

See him coming
He has no face
You must stop running
You must have faith

I don't want to fade away
I don't want to fade away
I don't want to fade away
I don't want to fade away

// Close To You //

[G. Tipton, K.K. Downing]

So many years that we were one
So many things we've done
The memories alive
But most of me has died

As I struggle with events
I'm offered words of strength
They do not comprehend
The passion we possessed

People tell me what to do
Tell me how I should get through
But they haven't got a clue
No one else comes close to you

I see your eyes before they closed
They looked right inside my soul
And they asked me not to grieve
I tried but still I bleed

I wake up, I break up
Try hard to shake off
The desolation as it grows
As nothing else comes close

And as I stand here by the grave
And the wind calls out your name
I know that time could never heal
The emptiness I feel

People try to give me hope
Tell me how I should let go
But they'll never really know
'Cause there's nothing else comes close

People tell me what to do
Tell me how I should get through
But they haven't got a clue
No one else comes close to you

// Subterfuge //

[G. Tipton, C. Tsangarides]

Holy father drink the fire water
Preaching peace as you go to war
Politicians making brave decisions
Always got self interest at heart

We are to you just a drop in the ocean
Maybe that's true but it's only a notion
You integrate with a friendly intrusion
We won't get fooled we have come to conclusion

Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me
We're confused but still we choose to disagree
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly
We refuse to bow down to conformity

Evil mothers hiding under covers
Always near but just out of sight

Hey big brother - watch as we recover
'Cause we'll never give up the fight
And we say no!

Give us a name and you give us the power
Watch as we gather our strength by the hour
You think we're blind and weak in decision
But we see it all from peripheral vision

Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me
We're confused but still we choose to disagree
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly
We refuse to bow down to conformity

Somebody wins, somebody lose
Some call it subterfuge
Somebody wins, somebody lose
They fall to subterfuge

Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me
We're confused but still we choose to disagree
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly
We refuse to bow down to conformity

Somebody wins, somebody lose
Some call it subterfuge
Somebody wins, somebody lose
They fall to subterfuge

// Metal Messiah //

[G. Tipton, C. Tsangarides]

Unholy Satan begs
He don't make no sense
Striving down there to
Recruit all of you
Do not live in sin
Or taste the fear again
Someone's coming back
Fuck the almanacs

Premonition say
Better step away
Skeptics preach a lot
Watch in aftershock
Heed the prophecies
In your offices
Someone out the blue
Explodes into view

The time is near
The day has dawned
Be prepared
For what's to come

He's the man
Armageddon
Walking through fire
Metal Messiah
He's the one
The father, the son
Creator destroyer
Metal Messiah

Heaven's in a state
Someone's at the gate
Crashing isn't cool
He don't know the rules
Stepping in he says
Time to rock the place
Like they've got a choice
Then all Hell breaks loose

Hell ain't ready for
What he's got in store
Time you fuckers had
Change of management
Better fornicate
Before it's too late
Cranks the power up
As he detonates

Never too late
To extricate
In the event
Die or repent

He's the man
Armageddon
Walking through fire
Metal Messiah
He's the one
The father, the son
Creator destroyer
Metal Messiah

You can pray to him
Auditorium
Buy the merchandise
Cheap at twice the price
Rising up above
With his decibels
He's come down to earth
Next the universe

The time is near
The day has dawned
Be prepared
For what's to come

Never too late
To extricate
In the event
Die or repent

Metal Messiah
Thy kingdom come
They will be done

// Cyberface //

[G. Tipton, S. Travis]

He lies in wait
For one mistake
Morphing on your screen

Those who dare
Or the unaware
Download him for a scream

Don't access the site
Or beware his megabyte

No virus scan
Detects the man
Or the deadly tasks he plans

Drooling lips
His circuits lit
He crouches for attack

Spider like on the web
Alive and well
But you are dead
Iniquitous in every way
Now he's come out to play

Cyberface
Iron will
Programmed to corrupt and kill
Cyberface
No escape
He is interfaced to Hell

Once he's summoned and installed - Cyberface
He'll infest your motherboard - Cyberface

Now he's got a grip
He will strip away your flesh
Alive yet dead
A fiend obsessed
He'll crash your system down
Once in place
He'll simulate
Your life - it's worthless now

God forsaken
Grotesque mind
An entity
That's come alive
Boot your screen
And suddenly
Approaching fast and mean

Once he's summoned and installed - Cyberface
He'll infest your motherboard - Cyberface

// Bloodsuckers //

[G. Tipton, K.K. Downing]

Don't speak to me of morality
Justice wrong or right
You dig up the dirt ignore the hurt
And spit out all your lies

Conscience free as we bleed
Hypocrisy born from greed
Don't preach to me of integrity
Or your legal highs

The judge's thrilled
He's dressed to kill
On TV every night

Subliminal - so absurd
It's criminal - yet can't be heard

Bloodsuckers - how can they sleep at night
Bloodsuckers - nothing but parasites

You will be on the stand today
They cannot harm you - it's okay
But they will destroy your family
And drag you through hell and tragedy

A circus heading into town
Complete with cameras and the clowns
The First Amendment shot to bits
The world is watching just for kicks

As the day drew close to hand
For all to view the faceless man
He put out the lights - it's sad
Now who's to blame for that?

Intimidate twist what you say
With their fine points of law
They lose the case but pontificate
And then appeal some more

Subliminal - it's so absurd
It's criminal - but can't be heard

Bloodsuckers - how can they sleep at night
Bloodsuckers - nothing but parasites

Bloodsuckers - how can they sleep at night
Bloodsuckers - nothing but parasites

I swear to tell the truth
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth
So help me God!

You will be on the stand today
They cannot harm you - it's okay
They will destroy your family
And drag you through hell and tragedy

Bloodsuckers - parasites

// In Between //

[G. Tipton]

I am love, I am hate
I'm an atheist with faith
Vent my anger with a smile
I'm polite or obscene
Either whisper or I scream
I'm not quite what I seem
I'm somewhere in between

I am young in my old age
I am calm or in a rage
I'm your friend or enemy
A pacifist or at war
I am rich but I am poor
I'm all extremes
I'm nowhere in between

Wide awake
Or in a dream
Nowhere in between
Like the pulse of a machine
I'm driven to extremes

I feel the turmoil boil in me
I'm neither healthy nor diseased
I am all extremes
But I'm still in between

Say right or say wrong
Outcast yet I belong
I'm high or I'm dry
Say I am weak yet I am strong

In between
In between

I am my alter ego
I am subconsciously
In depth but also shallow
Or somewhere in between

Oh I know I am
Always first in line or last
I swim with sharks or drown with rats
I'll defend as I attack
My world and yours are not the same
I am in a different lane
I am not where I seem
But I'm somewhere in between

I seek revenge
As I forgive
I die to live - ah
Not afraid but scared to death
I don't fit in

In between - all extremes

// Lost And Found //

[G. Tipton, K.K. Downing]

I always used to be afraid
That I was going to lose my way
I never used to walk in line but stray

I never thought I'd see it through
That I could deal with losing you
But suddenly I see the light of day

Leading me in
From out of the night
Staying on course - I'm still alive
I had to confess I never thought I would ever survive

I was lost and found
I had run aground
I was lost but now I'm found

Focused on my altered state
I would just disorientate
Suffering alone amongst the crowd

Drifting on a sea of doubt
And no one ever heard me shout
That I was lost and couldn't find my way

No one at hand
Having no plan
Stumbled through a barren land

After so long
Of going wrong
I found the road

I was lost and found
I had run aground
I was lost but now I'm found

I was lost and found
I had hit the ground
I was lost but now I found

That I don't need no one
To survive
You've got to believe alone
You'll rise

Starting to run
Shedding the load
Now I can see I'm close to home

After so long
Of going wrong
I found the road

I was lost and found
I had run aground
I was lost but now I'm found

// What's My Name? //

[Written by GLENN TIPTON, K.K. DOWNING & RIPPER OWENS]

You always were too cool
Pushing us around school
Everyone knew who you were
You always walked the line
We had to step aside
We always had to eat your dirt

But the tables turned
And things have changed
Time for a lesson
So let's spell it out again
Remind me just in case
You might have forgotten
What's my name?
Say it again

You always brought us down
Kicked the weak around
Making out that we didn't exist
When we'd speak our views
You'd say 'who are you'
And make your point with a fist

But the tables turned
And things have changed
Time for a lesson
So let's spell it out again
Remind me just in case
You might have forgotten
What's my name?
Say it again

// The Green Manalishi //

[Recorded with Ripper Owens]

Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks
And you come creeping around, making me do things I don't want to do

Can't believe that she needs my love so bad
Come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad
Busting in all my dreams, making me see things I don't want to see

'Cause you're the Green Manalishi with the two-pronged crown
All night dragging us up, or you're bringing us down
Just taking my love, and slip away
Leaving me here, trying to keep from following you
