// Dragonaut //

Welcome to my world of steel
Master of my domain
Cower as the pain's unsealed
Disasters where I'll reign

Father of Sin
I'll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify

Fire in the sky
Paralysed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Icon to the fall of man
Worshipped like a king
Fearless as I now condemn
Every living thing

Father of Sin
I'll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify

Fire in the sky
Paralysed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Father of Sin
I'll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify

Relish the blaze
Left all in a daze
He came and consumed and let fly

Fire in the sky
Paralysed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Fire in the sky
Paralysed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

// Redeemer Of Souls //

Time to settle the score
He's loaded to feel their remorse
Steadfast strong that's for sure
The deal of his life takes its course
No giving in
They don't understand
They get to give up and to meet his demands

Count down coming your way
He's the last to obey
Watch him seizing the day
Redeemer - redeemer of souls

There's no holding him back
The ransom announces his deeds
He's not cutting you slack
Just taking what ever he needs
Diamonds for eyes
As he begins
On that two wheeler from hell on the wind

Now he's setting the tune
They know the stare down is soon
Vengeance comes at high noon
Redeemer of souls
On the skyline
The stranger draws near
Feel the heat and he's shaking with fear

Countdown coming your way
He's the last to obey
Watch him seizing the day
Redeemer of souls

// Halls Of Valhalla //

Fierce is the gale
From the north sea
We drink and rejoice from the chalice
Holding the course
Through long nights and days
The ice and the hail bear no malice
Tow the line
Keep it fine
Every man seeks this end

Valhalla - you are calling
Valhalla - you are calling me home
Valhalla - new day dawning
Valhalla - this is where I belong - I belong

We crash o'er the waves
Bite deep on the oars
Scouring the spray
On the storm's maul
Then lightning reveals
For what we all pray
By Odin in Asgard
It's land fall
Life from death
Combat rests
Heralds peace for the slain

Valhalla - you are calling
Valhalla - you are calling me home
Valhalla - new day dawning
Valhalla - this is where I belong - I belong

The storm in the night takes us there
On an unrelenting tide
As the wind drives us ashore
Halls of Valhalla
Tow the line
Keep it fine
Every man seeks this end

The halls of Valhalla are calling me home
The halls of Valhalla that's where we belong
Valhalla you are calling
Valhalla you are calling me home

Valhalla new day dawning
Valhalla this is where I belong

// Sword Of Damocles //

Will you take the dare if it ever was placed
There's danger to challenge the throne
Deceivers will rise and weave their web of stealth
Can you face them standing alone

When men lead by words that are false as they preach
Fatality waits in the wings
Surrounded by fools behind walls that are breached
Beware of the jester that sings

Stand tall rise up stay strong fighting your enemies
Truth will find it's reward
If you live and die by the sword

The whispers can't hide when the tongues are let loose
Then hiding the truth is absurd
A stab in the back or taste of the noose
Is when action speaks louder than words

Stand tall rise up stay strong fighting your enemies
Truth will find it's reward
If you live and die by the sword

Wield the spear of light
Guard it with your life
Sword of Damocles - sword of Damocles

Stand tall rise up stay strong fighting your enemies
Truth will find it's reward
If you live and die by the sword

His truth will find its reward
If you live and die by the sword

// March Of The Damned //

We're walking the streets
We know where we'll meet
Can't stop us
They don't know why they try
Can't hurt us
We'll never die

We are on the march of the damned
Of the damned
March of the damned

We know what's at stake
Won't take your mistakes
Can't break us
We'll never fall, black souls
It's over
Just watch us crawl

We are on the march of the damned
Of the damned
March of the damned

We're walking the streets
We know where we'll meet
Can't stop us
They don't know why they try
Can't hurt us
We'll never die

We are on the march of the damned
Of the damned
March of the damned

// Down In Flames //

My last days
We shall see
They are coming now
They're after me
They want blood
Yes it's true
Going quietly I just don't do

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory

In my heart
I can say
I'll be ready for what comes my way
Don't be fooled
I can tell
Where I'm going to will serve me well

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory

Leaving my mark on the world when I've gone
Spreading the word by the deeds that I've done

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory

// Hell & Back //

I have roamed so far away
I have found there's no turning back
I have seen so many things
I have been to hell and back

Still in the land of the living
Rocking the home of the brave
Staying alive and still kicking
Ain't got no need to be saved

Out of the fire and into the black
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back

When I was young life was savage
The leather gets scuffed as it's worn
Rolling along you get damaged
So you grab the bull by the horns

Out of the fire and into the black
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back
Taking it up higher when you're under attack

We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back

We have roamed so far away
We have found there's no turning back
We have seen so many things
We have been to hell and back

Out of the fire and into the black
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back
Taking it up higher when you're under attack

We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back

We've all been under attack
We've all been to hell and back

// Cold Blooded //

I have no face
I have no mind
I have no senses left
You see I'm blind

I feel no faith
I hear no truth
The reasonings I have
Have all come loose

There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice

I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood
That runs through me

I lie hear numb
My conscience clear
And all the decency
Tranfused to fear

I feel no faith
I hear no truth
The reasonings I have
Have all come loose

There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice

I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood
That runs through me

You took my life and all I live for
I'm left for dead
Cold blooded and in hell

There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice

I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood that runs through me

// Metalizer //

Thrusting from a grave of unholy earth
Giving all his worth
Let the damned be saved
All that evil sin buried underground
Feeling safe and sound in his deadly skin

Heard the cry of pain so he's wide awake
No for heavens sake
He's become insane
How we feared the worst of a world gone mad
Never been so bad with a curse of
His immortal soul at stake
Hear the storm clouds break

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

Withe a clash of steel as the war begins
All he does is grin
At the pain he feels
Fixing for a war of a hundred years
With with no sense of fear tooth and nail will
Claw at flesh and bone to prevail
His honor will not fail

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

In this war that you can't win
You will die or live
He has ruled for a thousand years
He can't ever forgive

Fire and brimstone fill the earth and sky
Still he will defy

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

// Crossfire //

Watch your own reflection
Read between the lines
Lost in this confusion
It's a sign of the times

Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go
Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go

Opium for the masses
World's gone deaf and dumb
Victims of insanity
Ruled by the gun

Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go
Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go

Too much information
Messes with your mind
Pushing back the enemy
Blind leads the blind

World of smoking mirrors
Leaves you in a daze
Find your own solution
Out of the maze

Searing on the bible
Hypocrites and fools
Losing your religion
Breaking all the rules

Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go
Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go

// Secrets Of The Dead //

The shifting sands conceal the truth
Revealing only lies
A crescent moon casts ghostly shapes
As somewhere some thing flies

We let ourselves be bled
Secrets of the dead

Deserted by the ghosts that knew
Man's triumphs had no bounds
Left starving by our own mistakes
The sands reclaimed their ground

We let ourselves be bled
Secrets of the dead
Time takes us down so deep
Is this the place we seek?

Secrets of the dead
Secrets of the dead

We never learn form our mistakes
Imperfect till the end
You can't pick up the pieces
And the hearts we break can't mend

As if they knew the gift they brought
Was wasted on this earth
They searched out for a better race
On whom to bring rebirth

We let ourselves be bled
Secrets of the dead
We let ourselves be bled

Secrets of the dead
Where angels fear to tread
The secrets of the dead

// Battle Cry //

Hail the hero coming home
Honour bound from whence he roamed
Fortitude and skill
Call of duty all alone

Lead the nation for the crown
Serve the orders coming down
Charge ahead with pride
Guard the chivalry you've shown

Those forsaken reawakened with my battle cry

Indestructible by choice
Valour rings out with the voice
Rail the consequence
Destiny's the flag you hoist

Your endeavor lives forever with my battle cry

Battle cry
Death defy
Battle cry
Never die

Cast this sorrow to the wind

Let tomorrow be the light you're made to herald in
Like a master of the seven seas
Your reputation's grown
This eternal flame's been sown

Praise for sacrifice that's done
Well deserved you carried on
Let your hearts be full
For those heroes every one

Restitution absolution with my battle cry
Exoneration condemnation with my battle cry

Battle cry
Death defy
Battle cry
Battle cry

// Beginning Of The End //

The time has come
And as I reach up to the sky
The love will never die

At last it's here
The darkest sky begins to clear
The final hour draws near

But the voices are calling me
Erasing the pain and the fear

So lay me down
Lay me to rest
It's over now 'cause I know
It's the beginning of the end

And so we'll rise
By the grace of God alone
His words are carved in stone

I'm never gone
I'll always be within your heart
Waiting's the worst part

Now the voices are calling me
Soothing me and easing the pain and the fear

So lay me down
Lay me to rest
It's over now 'cause I know
It's the beginning of the end

And I see my life pass quickly by
I am watching
All these years we thought we were so wise
They mean nothing

Walk alone into the dying mist come alive for ever
See the things we've never seen before
Hand in hand together

They galling rays are lighting up the open door
We've all been waiting for
All the voices are calling me
Showing the path that is clear

So lay me down
Lay me to rest
It's over now 'cause I know
It's the beginning of the end

So lay me down
Lay me to rest
It's over now 'cause I know
It's the beginning of the end

// Snakebite //

Two bit sniper
Kiss the viper
Lie in wait as you take the bait
Feel you getting nearer
And I'm coiled up aiming to bite

The clock starts ticking
When you start gunning
I strike so fast
You won't see me coming

Get ready - ready for a snake bite
Get ready - ready for a snake bite

I'll kill your will
You can run till
There's no escape when you taste my venom
I'll track you down till there's no place left to hide

The clock starts ticking
When you start gunning
I'll strike so fast
You won't see me coming

Get ready - ready for a snake bite
Get ready - ready for a snake bite

Undertaker meet you maker
I'm cutting loose and let fly
Double dealer moving in nearer
It's time to say goodbye

Feel my poison
Your misfortune
Flowing through you paralyzing
Every vein in your body
Till your brain's ready to explode

The clock starts ticking
When you start gunning
I'll strike so fast you won't see me coming

Get ready - get ready - ready for a snake bite
Get ready - get ready - ready for a snake bite

You won't see me coming

Get ready - get ready - ready for a snake bite
Get ready - get ready - ready for a snake bite

You won't see me coming

// Tears Of Blood //

Shattered in the name of God
Shattered - batter never spare the rod
Eradicate till nothing's left
As they run you through
Shattered - battered slay the chosen fey

Tears of blood
Always falling
Tears of blood
On holy ground

Savaged for this desperate cause
Savaged - ravaged left with no remorse
Eternal life's divisive lie
Evades each mortal man
Savaged - ravaged destroying what you can

Tears of blood
Always falling
Tears of blood
On holy ground
Tears of blood
Always falling
We are weakened by your tears of blood

Hate lies till the very end
Faith dies by the hands of friends

Stay alive and live
Like you did before
Give your life to live forever
Forever more

Tears of blood
Always falling
Tears of blood
On holy ground
Tears of blood
Always falling

We are weakened by your tears of blood

Crying tears of blood
Crying tears of blood

// Creatures //

The night wind blows
Your heart rate grows
Your pulse is racing faster

They're on your trail
They know you'll fail
You're flirting with disaster

Creatures

The frost lies thick
Your breath comes quick
No chance for your survival

Life takes it's toll
And burns your soul
They've never had a rival

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night

Their sense of smell
Was honed in hell
Their eyes sharp as needles

You're bathed in sweat
You've lost your bet
Caught in this upheaval

Creatures

You're on your own
So scream and moan
It's pointless now for praying

They'll run you through
You'll get what's due
Then they'll call it a day

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night

Creatures

The night wind blows
Your heart rate grows

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night

Creatures of the night

Creatures

// Bring It On //

Lay it on the line
Give it some stick
No nickle no dime
Gonna pile it on thick

Rattle your cage
Moving in fast
Don't take no lip
He ain't gonna pass

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows
Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows

Don't cry me a river
Sink or swim
We're in this together
So get stuck in

Pedal to the metal
Rise or fall
Way to go now
Winner takes all

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows
Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows

Take your shot
You think you're big enough
You're gonna bite the dust
Give it all you got
You think you're tough enough

Come on bring it on

Bring it on
Step out of the shadows
Bring it on
Step out of the shadows

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows
Out of the shadows

Bring it on - bring it on
Step out of the shadows
Out of the shadows
