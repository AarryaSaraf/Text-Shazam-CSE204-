How am I supposed to manage my infallible beliefs
While I'm sockin' it to ya?
Performing in Spanish on Italian TV
Sometime in the future
Whilst wondering if your mother still ever thinks of me
Hallelujah

Blank canvasses lent against gallery walls
Flowing towards sculptures of Anything Goes
On the marble stairs

Is that vague sense of longing kinda trying to cause a scene?
Guess I'm talking to you now
Puncturing your bubble of relatability
With your horrible new sound
Baby, those mixed messages ain't what they used to be
When you said 'em out loud

Blank canvasses lent against gallery walls
Flowing towards sculptures of Anything Goes
On the marble stairs
Leading to almost wherever you want them to

The simulation cartridge for City Life '09
Is pretty tricky to come by
Village coffee mornings with not long since retired spies
Now that's my idea of a good time
Flash that angle grinder smile, gasp and roll your eyes
And help me to get untied from the chandelier
And twizzling 'round an umbrella
I'll sing a tune
