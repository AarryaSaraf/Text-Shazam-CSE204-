Jet skis on the moat
They shot it all in CinemaScope
As though it's the last time you're gonna ride
Showstoppers anonymous
Come over here and give your buddy a hug
So much for deciding not to let it slide

Is there something on your mind
Or are you just happy to sit there and watch
While the paint job dries?
When it's over, you're supposed to know

Lights out on the Wonderpark
Your sawtoothed lover boy was quick off the mark
That's long enough in the sunshine for one night
Didn't recognise you through the smoke
Pyjama pants and a Subbuteo cloak
You know that it's alright if you wanna cry

Is there something on your mind
Or are you just happy to sit there and watch
While the paint job dries?
When it's over, you're supposed to know

Jet skis on the moat
They shot it all in CinemaScope
As though it's the last time you're gonna ride
