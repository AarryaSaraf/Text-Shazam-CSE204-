That's quite a number to sing
Spot lit getting lowered in
Can you co-direct and play the twins?
And adapt the main theme for mandolins?
I've conjured up wonderful things
The Ballad of What Could Have Been
Over and out
It's been a thrill

I had big ideas, the band was so excited
The kind you'd rather not share over the phone
But now the orchestra's got us all surrounded
And I cannot for the life of me remember how they go

Co-ordinated release
Nationwide festivities
We had 'em out of their seats
Waving their arms and stomping their feet
Some just hysterical scenes
The Ballad of What Could Have Been
Over and out
Really it's been a thrill

I had big ideas, the band was so excited
The kind you'd rather not share over the phone
But now the orchestra's got us all surrounded
And I cannot for the life of me remember how they go
I just can't for the life of me remember how they go
