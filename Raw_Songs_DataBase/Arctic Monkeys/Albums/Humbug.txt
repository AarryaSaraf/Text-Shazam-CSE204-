Album: Humbug

// My Propeller //

If you can summon the strength, tow me
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your descent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys

Coax me out my low and have a spin of my propeller

It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrowed the beak off a bald eagle
Oh, momentary synergy

Coax me out my low
Sink in to tomorrow
Coax me out my low and have a spin of my propeller

My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller

// Crying Lightning //

Outside the caf√© by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude
As you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick'n'mix

Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking that I haven't been called 'cold' before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

Your past times consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I loved that little game you had called "Crying Lightning"
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your past times consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called "Crying Lightning"
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes
You are crying lightning

Your past times consisted of the strange
Twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called "Crying Lightning"
"Crying Lightning"
"Crying Lightning"
"Crying Lightning"

Your past times consisted of the strange,
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called "Crying..."

// Dangerous Animals //

I'm pinned down by the dark

Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well told gripe
The most frustrating type
You should have racing stripes the way you keep me in pursuit
You sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
And you make me wheeze
Then to my knees you do promote me

I'm pinned down by the dark

A-N-I-M-A-L
She makes my head pirouette more than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

The light it fidgets through, the thoughts will soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance
The first and final chance
And of course the audience of frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam she broke everyone's heart.

I'm pinned down by the dark

A-N-I-M-A-L
She makes my head pirouette more than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
The most unsuitable pet, it's been long enough now so let's make a mess lioness

Pinned down by the dark
I'm pinned down by the dark

D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L

// Secret Door //

Fools on parade cavort and carry on
For waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here
It's a magnolia celebration
To be attempted on a Wednesday night
It's better than to get a reputation
As a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion
She came to in this overture

The secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing
She's just giggling along

Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
And then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
And unveiling the unexpected
I, who was earlier reluctant, was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature
Survive in such a habitat

The secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing
She's just giggling along
And even if they were to find us
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied

As all the fools on parade
Cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
Ones you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind
To be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade
Frolic and fuck about to make a gaze
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture
That holds her absence
But you're daft to think she'd care

Fools on parade [3x]
Conduct a sing-along

// Potion Approaching //

I was biting the time zone
And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
And threw caution to the colourful
Then we fell asleep in the car
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip
And the tide took me to your mouth
And then swept me back down to your palms

It's them that put me inside the reminder
That yours is the only ocean
(Yours is the only ocean)
That I want to swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on

I've got this ego mechanic
She's always trying to give me vitamins
Oh she'd be frightened of your reflection
I preferred her as a cartoon
If I could be someone else for a week
I'd still spend it chasing after you
Cos she's not shattering my attitude
No matter how she folds the potion

Yours is the only ocean
That I want to swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on to

I'm swinging on
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean

Potion Approaching
Shield your eyes
Potion Approaching
Visualize
Holding a token
Swollen in size
Potion Approaching
Shield your eyes

Oh but if we're going to escape though
We really ought to think it through
Would you like me to build you a go kart?

// Fire And The Thud //

You showed me my tomorrow
Beside a box of matches
A welcome threatening stir

My hopes of being stolen
Might just ring true
Depends who you prefer

But if it's true you're gonna run away
Tell me where, I'll meet you there

Am I snapping the excitement
If I pack away the laughter, and tell you how it feels?

And does burden come to meet you
If I've questions of the feature that rolls on your dream reel

The day after you stole my heart
Everything I touched told me it would be better shared with you, with you

And now you're hiding in my soup
And this book reveals your face
And you're splashing in my eyelids
The concentration continually breaks
I did request the mark you cast didn't heal as fast
I hear your voice in silences
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud?

In the jostling crowd
You're not allowed
To tell the truth
And the photo booth's a liar!

There's a sharpened explanation
But there's no screaming reason to enquire

I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes with things
They'd never see if it smacked them in their temples

// Cornerstone //

I thought I saw you in The Battleship but it was only a look alike
She was nothing but a vision trick under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast when I asked her if I could call her your name

I thought I saw you in The Rusty Hook, huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look and kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close and she held me very tightly until I asked awfully politely
"Please, can I call you her name?"

And I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt and kept my short cuts to myself

I thought I saw you in The Parrot's Beak messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak and she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
"No, you can't call me her name"

Tell me where's your hiding place
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt and kept my short cuts to myself

I saw your sister in The Cornerstone on the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own I thought she might understand
She was close, well you couldn't get much closer
She said, "I'm really not supposed to, but, yes, you can call me anything you want"

// Dance Little Liar //

I heard the truth was built to bend
A mechanism to suspend the guilt is what you will require
And still you've got to dance little liar

It's just like those fibs to pop and fizz
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz 
And you're bound to trip and she'll detect the fiction on your lips
And dig a contradiction up

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar takes a lot less time

I'm sure it's clear and plain to read
It's not an alibi you need just yet
Oh no, it's something for those beads of sweat
Yes that will get you back to normal

And after you have dabbed the patch
You'll breathe and then proceed to scratch the varnish off
That newly added calmness
So as not to raise any alarms too soon

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt

The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
Have you got itchy bones and in all your time alone
Can you hack your mind being riddled with the wrong memories?  

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt in between the dirt

// Pretty Visitors //

Trudging through the morning and the tramp with the trampoline under his arm, shifts past your whiskers so stark is the charm but the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned

And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move round in your muddy mind blatantly caked and unwilling to wind uncooperative time so he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the

What came first the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk, your legs start running and your head gets caught

Canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away I am unhappy to say, behold there's a crook in the hammock plays

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

Behold there's a crook in the hammock plays cruelly with the base of the scales
And fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

// The Jeweller's Hands //

Fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake
Dull caresses once again irritate
Tread softly stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek

You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless and weightless your imagination runs

And now it's no ones fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

In the moonlight they're more thrilling those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit was like falling off the ferry in the night

The inevitables gather to push you around
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
It became laughter's assassin shortly after he showed you what it was

And now it's no ones fault but yours, at the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

If you've a lesson to teach me I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, let's get it engraved

If you've a lesson to teach me I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, let's get it engraved

If you've a lesson to teach me I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, let's get it engraved
