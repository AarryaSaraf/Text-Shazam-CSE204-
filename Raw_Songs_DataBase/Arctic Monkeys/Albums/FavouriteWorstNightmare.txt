Brian
Top marks for not tryin'
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted

And I wonder are you puttin' us under
Cause we can't take our eyes off the T-shirt and ties combination
Well see you later, innovator

Some want to kiss some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet but she's yours

She'll be sayin' use me
Show me the Jacuzzi
I imagine that it's there on a plate
Your high rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm

[Brian:]
Calm, collected, and commandin'
(Top marks for not tryin')
You leave the other story standin'
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes that have wept cause you've stolen their ...thunder
Are you puttin' us under

Cause we can't take our eyes off the T-shirt and ties combination
Well see you later, innovator

// Teddy Picker //

They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punch-line before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen

They've sped up to the point where they provoke you
To tell the fucking punch-line before you have told the joke
"Sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top 100 list"

And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were dying for it

Saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
Do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
Do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath?
That says that we are defenders
Of any poser or professional pretender around

When did your list
Replace the twist and turn like a fist
Replaced a kiss?
Don't concern us with your bollocks
I don't want your prayer
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were gagging for it

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker

Presuming that all things are equal?
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you?

// D Is For Dangerous //

He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was thinking an escape
But the place was well guarded

The guiltyness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for Delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
D is for...

Desperately trying to stimulate what it was that was alright
3 quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
And every compromission
Another freak episode

He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
You should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

// Balaclava //

Running off over next door's garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun

The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
With the ending reek of salty cheeks
And runny make-up alone

Or will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish
Where you'll wish you'd never been born

You tie yourself to the tracks
And there isn't no going back
And it's wrong wrong wrong
But we'll do it anyway
'Cause we love a bit of trouble

Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start

The confidence is the balaclava,
I'm sure you baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong wrong wrong,
She can hardly wait

That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime!

That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
That's right,
He won't let her out his sight

Will you be able to boast
Of the day of the most
Flawless heist of all time

You knew that it'd be trouble
Right before the very first kiss
Quiet, unassuming,
But you heard that they were the naughtiest

She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
But sorry, sweetheart, I'd much rather
Keep on the balaclava.

// Fluorescent Adolescent //

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis

Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem,
My love, when you dream them up...

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it

Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem,
My love, when you dream them up

Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go? Whoa.

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again.

you're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
We're just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again

You used to get it in your fishnets
(falling about)
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
(you took a left off Last Laugh Lane)
Landed in a very common crisis

Everything's in order in a black hole
(we're sounding it out)
Everything was pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
(but you're not coming back again)
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

// Only Ones Who Know //

In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet the Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow we could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own

And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by new year's eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

And even if somebody could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know

// Do Me A Favour //

Well the morning was complete.
There was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat,
Several hours or several weeks,
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak!

It's the beginning of the end, the car went up the hill,
And disappeared around the bend, ask anyone they'll tell you that.
It's these times that it tends,
The start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
Oh! hold on to your heart.

Do me a favour and break my nose!
Do me a favour and tell me to go away!
Do me a favour and stop asking questions!

She walked away, well her shoes were untied,
And the eyes were all red,
You could see that we'd cried, and I watched and I waited,
'Till she was inside, forcing a smile and waving goodbye.

Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold.
Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold.

And do me a favour, and ask if you need some help!
She said, do me a favour and stop flattering yourself!
How to tear apart the ties that bind, perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind,
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind

// This House Is A Circus //

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
There's a,

Room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And the anomaly is slipping to familiar ways

And we're forever unfulfilled
Can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes
Forever unfulfilled
And can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes

The more you open your mouth
The more you're forcing performance
And all the attention is leading me to feel important (completely obnoxious)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

Wriggling around and it's so that you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
Struggling with the notion that it's life not film

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

// If You Were There, Beware //

If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Three hundred and fifty no thank yous and nobody flinches
Go on girl go on, give us something gruesome
We require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rob the words from her gob and
Take the source of the innocents

If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant
To fill column inches
And you've had enough, what you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs
As they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart

Out to the point she'll comply

Why leave her on her own
If I'd have known then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
Why leave her on her own
If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known

There's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
Our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give
She hasn't got it to give

// The Bad Thing //

Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier, it might make it worse

Oh the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me but it's alright
She's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers make her too forward to ignore
Well, she's talking but I'm not entirely sure, oh

Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier, it might make it worse

Oh I'm stood at the bar and somebody's partner's talking to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't she murmurs things to confirm
That the tragedy is true
And I knew 'how could she could have anyone she wants
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response

Like I don't mind
Be a big mistake
For you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really love it's fine
Really love it's fine

And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse
She said, "It's the red wine this time," but that is no excuse

// Old Yellow Bricks //

Old yellow bricks,
Love's a risk,
Quite the little Escapologist
Looked so miffed,
When you wished,
For a thousand places better than this,

You are the fugitive,
But you don't know what you're running from,
You can't kid us,
And you couldn't trick anyone,
Houdini, love you don't know what you're running away from,

Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up,
Blinded by nostalgia?
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

She was enraged by the way,
That the emperor put traps in the cage,
And the days she deemed dull,
Lead to nights reading beer bottles,

You're such a fugitive,
But you don't know what you're running from,
You can't kid us,
And you couldn't trick anyone,
Houdini, love you don't know what you're running away from,

Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up,
Blinded by nostalgia?
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

You're at a loss,
Just because,
It wasn't all that you thought it was,

You are a fugitive but you don't know what you're running away from,

She said, "I want to sleep in a city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia."
I know I said, "Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?" but
Dorothy was right though

// 505 //

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh when you look at me like that my darling
What did you expect
I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though its no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

...and a smile

// Da Frame 2R //

007 and Brucey Wayne
Are shitting there 'selves because there's another name coming to claim
what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

He's certainly come into his own,
There's one on his arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two things you'll never
Be my darling

Another roll around and another push and shove
Further away from the idea of love
And his conclusion it must be good
Oh wouldn't the penny would drop with an incredible thud
They forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she's going
But don't know where she's been
And as opposed to the 'other thing'
He'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two
Things you'll never be my darling

Things you'll never be my darling

(Two things you will never be my darling)

(Two things you'll never be my darling)

They sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
Not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(But not for this kid, not when they come to you.)

// Matador //

She was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl
A very clever girl who stood out amongst several ones
A terrible dilemma and forever he'll regret the day
He didn't make the rescue from the bullring
Sulking won't get you nowhere, son
There's blood on your chin where you've bitten your tongue
Smitten, but might not be smitten for long
If you're still sitting, she'll soon be smitten and gone
