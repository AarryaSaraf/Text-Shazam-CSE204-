// 2013 //

Well the times are so a'changing
Baby even when it's live
You can press pause and rewind

You knew it would go amazing
But is this what you had in mind?
Oh there's nothing you can't find

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah)

On the back of a transmitter
There's a little shiny fruit
And it's coming after you

As for Instagram and Twitter
She got caught in both lassoes
And neither one will cut her loose

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah) Yeah

So baby take a walk with me
Past flying cars and time machines
There's magic like you won't believe, no

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy

// 7 //

Well I wrote my number down
I never wrote it down before
Was gonna bring it over like something from a film
But I didn't have the bottle at all

Well I'm looking and you kept staring
Your thoughts pairing up with mine
And when you're so pretty and I'm so shy
You probably didn't give me the eye but I'm sure you did

Well I went outside
Couldn't say I tried
And I felt regret
Because you haven't bashed me and dashed back in
'Cause the ship hasn't sailed yet

But when I did I couldn't see your face
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do
Well I dashed around tried to find you
But you were, nowhere to be seen
Oh no no...

(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)

Well she moved in ways, that kept her there
In our minds for days
And weeks and months
I was that amazed
And there she stayed
Surrounded by the what if's and the maybe's

// Anyways //

Just another microcosm somewhere in the ether
Putting a world to rights with Bing Crosby eyes
Oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
Exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place
Save it for a rainy day
Baby, you go hard in the paint
It's just another race to anyways

Philanthropic toga party
What a place for both the opposite sides of my double life to finally collide
Sharing secrets I was taking to the grave
Nosebleeds from epiphanies I took full in the face
Oh, come all by the fire, babe, let's all participate
In yet another race to anyways
Oh, how's your Mum and Dad been doing with the generation gap?

Yeah, I'm behind my movie camera
I've got my megaphone
You can call me Alexander
It's nice to meet you all

Listening to the Shipping Forecast
Driving to the airport
Me and the guys
Metropolis ablaze in the rear view
Devising methods to both have and eat your cake
Mmm, just like the ones that Mother Nature used to bake
You look as if you know exactly what I'm gonna say
Is just another race to
Anyways

// Bad Woman //

When you left the house this evening, 
You said you'd be back in a little while 
Well I've been waiting for such a long time, 
And this wait is driving me wild... 

And while I wait I think about you, 
Do you need me when I'm not there? 
Are you planning to be without me? 
Do you have a new attract? 

You're a bad bad woman 
You're a bad bad woman 

If he is on you... 
It keeps flashing through my mind, 
If you would only call, 
If you would be so kind. 
Imagine things, 
I see another man 
And it's this waiting I just can't stand... 

You're a bad bad woman 
You're a bad bad woman 
You're a bad bad woman 
You're a bad bad woman

// Catapult //

Both sides, in softly came the growl from both sides
And if his whisper splits the mist
Just think of what he's capable of with his kiss

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Turned your legs to little building blocks
And with his index finger flicks you on your socks

I'll go high pitched, he'll talk and make your voice sound high pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own
And whispered in your ear in that baritone

It's the same stone, his heart was cut out of the same stone
That they used to carve his jaw, it's impossible not to feel inferior

And he could catapult you back to your daddy
Or into any hissing misery
And he will tear you out the day after a triumph is as hollow
As the day after a tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape
When he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
And he's leaving without saying 'Bye'

And you would queue up to listen to him pissing
And hang around to watch some poor girl bluff
And then they chase him down the avenue
Incessantly pestering him to let them join the club

He knows how to put a cork in the fuss
And just how to shut up the charming ones of us
And I've seen him talking to your lady friend

There's a dust track waiting for betrayal
Where he'll teach you all the bits they've missed

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try

You cannot turn away

// Don't Forget Whose Legs You're On //

In the painted faces congregate
In the mating season
The seconds homes
They go alone
In no rush leave 'em
And there's a fountain
And a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And cuts you down to size

The people there
And the furniture
Start to seem important
A moment more
And you catch the floor
With a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc
Like the scimitar
Shaped yellow light
That picks you up
And cuts you down to size

Oh I had questions for the tap dancer
Sat on my lap
And she had child proof caps on her answers
Stone blower blow me a stone
And show me that handsome enchancer
She had a rock on her throttle
And a brown glass bottle full of
Shavings from the sun
Although those shoes affect your step
Don't forget whose legs you're on

There's a fountain and a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And it cuts you down to size

// Electricity //

Darlin' tell me something I don't know
Be my baby, be my GTO
Call me something no one else calls me
I forget how I want it
That electricity

My heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn't see you sneak in but I'm glad you stopped
Tell me something I don't already know
Like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity

Love like locked horns
Love like dominos
Be my midnight
Be my ebb and flow
I forget how I want it
How it crept up on me
It takes over
Electricity

And my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn't see you sneak in but I'm glad you stopped
Tell me something I don't already know
Like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity

Separated
There I face it
Love like thunder
Love like falling snow

Tell me something I don't already know
Like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity

// Evil Twin //

You've never met before,
But still she greets you like a long lost rock-and-roll.
She's definitely one of those,
But you'll go wherever she goes.

And when my body and my mind
Both start talking at the exact same time,
Tryna think of ways to make her mine,
But they're difficult to find.

It's not what I need.
No, your love's not what I need,
So, don't give it to me.

She said,

"Oh, well, I know this will sound cold,
But I really have to go.
Oh, it's not that I'm not free.
There's nowhere I need to be.
It's just your love's not what I need.
So, don't give it to me."

It's not what I need.
No, your love's not what I need.
So, don't give to me.

She said, "Baby, how can I believe you?
How can I believe you when you can't believe your luck?"
No point sticking to the plan when it's come unstuck.

It's more a hunger than a thirst.
She'll break your heart the second time
Before you know about the first.
Looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch,
But you'd let her do her worst.

And it's not hard to tell.
It's obvious the other angels faces fell,
When she told them that she had to go,
Swap her wings and overcoat for something colourful.

Bad news.

It's not what I need.
No, your love's not what I need.
So, don't give to me.

No, your love's not what I need,
So, don't give to me.
No, your love's not what I need,
So, don't give to me.
No, your love's not what I need,
So, don't give to me.
No, your love's not what I need.

// Fright Lined Dining Room //

[Verse 1]
You thrive on dancing in our laps
Before the more familiar chaps
And all the curtain leads to fever

We watched the womanizer cry
And in the last sip you and I
Declared we might require a breather

I am the truth true through and I
Convey excitement fluently
As solid as I can busk shock

With well presented merry men
And I know all too well
I shouldn't break the key off in the lock

[Chorus]
And the tumble splits the fray
Revealing silk and fit
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast

[Verse 2]
The days drag their heels
When you're not there to crack the whip
And the weeks wait to burst like a sache of brats

The old pantomime villian follows my coat
And he hides where it hangs and he spies through the slots

And meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
The cowels hide and wait to rot away
The identities of the willing

[Verse 3]
Drowned bags of sugar in the night
Rocketing shutter doors despite
The shop not opening for hours

You can itch, flap and whistle
And try to avoid the top
As I scribbled over dribble
You were snoring, showing off

[Chorus]
The tumble splits the frays
Revealing silk and fit
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast

// Hold On, We're Going Home //

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You put your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

Yeah
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

So just hold on we're going home 
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
You think that's something baby
You think that's something baby
You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
You think that's something baby
You think that's something baby

So just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
Yeah
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
So just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home

// I Haven't Got My Strange //

When I got back from fixing my hair
You were directing the traffic
Letting your stories slip on the snow
As if the transmission was automatic

It's arguable that i shouldn't have been there
It was fortunate timing
I had a hole in the pocket of my favorite coat
And my love dropped into the lining

(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me, I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me

You can't sleep 'til you've sat on the steps to weep 
'Til you feel like you've wept, yeah

(As long as you don't forget your strange)
(Have you got your strange?)
No not on me
I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me
I haven't got my strange
I better fetch my strange
I haven't got my strange
I haven't got my strange

// If You Found This It's Probably Too Late //

Under constant correction, a fraud, a fraud
Someone's perception, trying not to bore
I'm a cold-hearted kidder, applaud, applaud
If you're the highest bidder, I'm yours

You figure out pathetic sets
We're not sure of the etiquette
We think out pathetic sets
We're not sure of the etiquette

And if you found this, it's probably too late
Clinically cynical, hereditary hate
If you found this it's probably too late
Approaching the pinnacle, I'm running out of mates

If we concentrate on being off the cuff
Not sure we're ready, but probably rough
Frightened that honesty isn't enough
And it's nothing on the early stuff

// Joining The Dots //

Try and think of something colourful for this season
Pull the wool over the gullible for no reason
You are all I have these days, shake it up and run away
With the night squabbling behind you

From the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots.
I'm joining the dots.

Thought I heard them talking in their sleep yesterday
And I tried but I just can't believe a word they say
Hurry up they'll be here soon, sleeping in the afternoon
While the rain's trying to prove a point outside

From the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots.
I'm joining the dots.

Those people make me calm
Can't the flame
Come up to the moth for a change
And darling if it's all the same to you
I'll have you to myself
I'm joining the dots.
I'm joining the dots.

// Little Illusion Machine (Wirral Riddler) //

[Miles Kane:]
Swinging room to room
Planting something new
I've ridden the riddle, I'll do it again
Back to the Wirral where it all began

Wirral riddler

Send a letter to me, baby
I'm on the edge of my seat
Send a letter to me, baby
Little illusion machine

Riding through the gloom
Something beautiful

[Alex Turner:]
He's ridden the riddle, he'll do it again
He's going back to the Wirral where it all began

[Both:]
Wirral riddler

Send a letter to me, baby
I'm on the edge of my seat
Send a letter to me, baby
Little illusion machine

[Miles Kane:]
I tried it and I liked it but
It just never gets close enough

[Both:]
Send a letter to me, baby

(Wirral)
So tell me where have you been?
(Wirral)
Little illusion machine
(Wirral)
Hoping tonight is going to send me back to you

Wooow!

// Nettles //

Sank into their calculations and snorted on a stench 
A bare arithmetic 
Look for the boy who was hanging his head low 
More trophies and ideas 
To follow their pretend

With a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face 
He followed with obedience and fell in the nettles

I flew in some spiky whispers and he bought his own rope 
And skipped against the rode 
Did start not to find the dark lead and catch that man i hope 
Devices man are closed 
He lost all his foot holes

And with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face 
He followed with obedience and fell in the nettles,
Fell in the nettles,
Fell in the nettles

He was a toothpick and the garlic and the cinder upon the path 
Failed to blunt or hinder, a slow collapse 
And clinging to the door frame he was trapped 
After a reminder of where he had been 

With a smile in his pocket and a scowl on his face 
There was nowhere to flee 
Just had to tent in the nettles

// Only You Know //

I want to see something that used to be in your eyes again
I'm waiting to see it you know it's only a question of when
And I know how much I'm missing heaven
You know that its missing

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I want to be there too

I know it's not easy for you to start to believe again
And when the day comes don't let yourself be deceived again
Cause I know how you've been waiting
Such a long time that you've been waiting

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I want to be there too 

And I know how you've been waiting
Such a long time that you've been waiting

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I want to be there too

// Plastic Tramp //

He looks as if he hasnt slept, his hair is purposely unkept
And then he knew his people wept, when you crafted your plan
The shadows underneath the eyes, and everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of Proof is your disguise, you won't remember me
There's nothing really I can say, but sorry mate and walk away
I could be wrong unless you play your game,
This world is cruel and most unkind
And horrible is redefined, I can't imagine that you'd mind at all

You're lying again, you're conscious ain't your friend
And the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination,
Lying again you're conscious ain't your friend and the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination
Is he really on the street, desperation on deceit and what he's wearing on his feet won't solve our mystery,

And I am baffled by how you stand there, soaking it in
And do you hide your identity where you hide your grin, better hide your grin

Shadows underneath the eyes, everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of Proof is your disguise, you won't remember me

There's nothing really I can say, but sorry mate and walk away
I could be wrong unless you play your game,
This world is cruel and is most unkind
And horrible is redefined, I can't imagine that you'd mind at all
You're lying again, your conscious ain't your friend
And the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination,
Lying again your conscious ain't your friend and the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination

// Red Right Hand //

Take a little walk to the edge of town
And go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks

Where secrets lie in the border fires
And the humming wires
Well you know you're never coming back
Past the square past the bridge
Past the mills past the stacks

On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms
And tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all of those dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy

He'll reach deep into the hole
Heal your shrinking soul
And there won't be a single thing
That you can do
He's a god, he's a man
He's a ghost, he's a guru

They're whispering his name
Across this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
Is a red right hand

You don't have no money
He'll get you some
If you haven't got no car
He'll get you one
You've got no self respect
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy
Cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrio
And the bowery and the slums

A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere 
But he's not what he seems
You'll see him in your head and on the TV screen
Hey buddy, I'm warning you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god
He's a man, he's a guru

You're one microscopic cog
In his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
His red right hand

// Settle For A Draw //

Well I watch you tangle every weekend

It might start different but it ends up the same

One minute you're casually speaking

The next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame

With your Jerry can of words and tones


And no one's gonna start a revolution

So we best leave it well alone

And there's something that Frankie used to say, Apparently

Oh he says settle for a draw

Well you're not gonna get no more

So you should settle for a draw

I told you once I'm sure

I told you once I'm sure

You should settle for a draw

Why don't you settle for a draw?


Well you're right it is one set of rules for her

And then another set for you

But that's just the way it is I suppose

And there's nowt you can do

And lets not fall in the trap

Of answering back

I am just a beginner

But she'll be the only winner

That's for sure

So take the draw, if it's available

And if it sets on fire don't get out your jerry can of words and tones


And no one's gonna start a revolution

So we best leave it well alone

And there's something that Frankie used to say, Apparently

Oh he says settle for a draw

Well you're not gonna get no more

So you should settle for a draw

I told you once I'm sure

I told you once I'm sure

You should settle for a draw

Why don't you settle for a draw?

// Sketchead //

Sketchead
He's coming to your party
He's walking up your drive
And he's swinging all his keys round
Sketchead
He's seen you with your top off
He already knows your boyfriend retain your introductions
Sketchead
That cunts a protagonist
The pips in your quince
They are behind the spoil
The itch you can't itch in your ear
And the knock that shattered your packet of peppermints

Sketchead
There's poison in his spit
He'll compliment your tits
And leave you to your wits
Sketchead
Convincingly insisting the tyres were bald
When you gave him the car
Sketchead
Still coming to your party
Still walking up your drive
And still swinging all his keys round on his finger
As a pendulum to un nerve

And then there's you
You've changed
I approach you like you were the same
But soon it was apparent a new name was required
New lips went and fired accomplishments at me
While I'm captivated by your magazine skin
The tint on your limbs is obscures to begin
And you know full well
That anyone who says that
They don't prefer the sequel
Will still be swinging on themselves tonight

// Stop The World I Wanna Get Off With You //

Open Sesame
(We've places to go)
We've people to see
(Let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make
When you had to escape, say the word

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move and you'll probably be leaving soon
So I'm telling you

Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you

Eyes the color of
(Water left in mud)
Icing sugar dust
(Crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps rolling

Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both oughtta put 'em on hold and I know you agree

Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you

// Temptation Greets You Like Your Naughty Friend //

I don't ever want to hate you,

So don't show me your bed,

The only roads are cul-de-sacs,

The first thing that she said.


Temptation, greets you like your naughty mate,

The one that used to get you in bother,

But one you could never bring yourself to hate.


And she said we've got that spark,

That only lights a fuse,

Helps you see in the dark,

But it's a sight you'll lose when,

The temptation greets you like your naughty friend.


I don't ever want to hate you,

So don't show me your bed,

The only roads are cul-de-sacs,

The only ends are dead.


Temptation greets you like your naughty mate,

One that made you steal and set things on fire,

But one you haven't seen of late.


And I said that kind of talk,

Only adds intrigue,

To the cauldron of thought,

It's already exceeding,

Temptation, the very thing that held her back.


I don't ever want to hate you,

So don't show me your bed,

The only roads are cul-de-sacs,

The only ends are dead.


I don't ever want to hate you,

It's not part of the plan,

So keep your charm where I can't see it,


And your hands where I can.

[Dizzee Rascal]


We used to be in tight me and my naughty friends,

Caused enticement ? in the air,

I mean day 'n' night,

We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight,

Smoking, drinking, joyriding,

Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding,

Reckless gangsters ? no direction,

No sign of correction,

But then i switched it off,

Changed my ways,

What the hell!

Like oh my days ,

But like my naughty friends,

They're not phased,

Can't believe that this music pays,

See no reason why we can't do,

All the things we've always done,

Still in my heart I know thats just what,

But its hard to fight the temptation son.

[Arctic Monkeys]


The panic will fall down around you,

If you don't do what I say.


I don't ever want to hate you,

So don't show me your bed,

The only roads are cul-de-sacs,

The only ends are dead.


I don't ever want to hate you,

It's not part of the plan,

So keep your charm where I can't see it,

And your hands where I can

// The Afternoon's Hat //

Made me kiss ya' with a whisper
and violently you swung, through unfamiliar tounge
Couldn't listen to tradition, grabbed me by the wrist to silently insist

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

You stood shirtless and confident
Listenin' to the fools, tickling the rules
Their obsessions follow patterns
Sat upon their stools, with their attitudes

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at.

// The Bakery //

I wish you would have smiled in the bakery
Or sat on a tatty settee
At some mutual friend's gathering
And the more you keep on looking the more it's hard to take
Love, we're in stalemate
To never meet it surely where we're bound
There's one in every town
Just there to grind you down

I wish I would have seen you in the post office
Well maybe I did and I missed it
Too busy with a mind on clever lines
Why not the rounder's pitch or the canteen?
You're slacking love where have you been?
Just had to go and wait until tonight
(To give me the invite don't worry it's alright)

I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
Sipping on a lemonade
In the paper cup and chewing on the straw
And I wish I'd seen you in the bakery
But if I'd seen you in the bakery
You probably wouldn't have seen me

// The Lovers //

Up from the pastures of boredom
out from the sea of discontent
they come in packs like hungry hounds
Up seekers of the dark enchantment.

They haunt the boulevards and bars
they pray to wishing wells and stars
they ride the hurricane of hope
not looking back but on they go
toward the distance and deceiving
and all the while they keep believing
they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when they pair off two by two
they feel they are the chosen few
and though their beds are made of straw
they feel like velvet in the night
and so the night is never ending
its made of distance and pretending
coz they're special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when love goes away
and when love goes...
goodbye...
catches in their throats like cotton
rises in their hearts like rain
the good times suddenly are all forgotten
the hunt begins again.

They search the subways and the streets
their faces tired, like their feet
their bodies aching to be warm
and so they hide behind the moon
their loneliness inside them growing
but they take comfort in just knowing
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers

And when love comes again
and when love comes
hello...
rises from their throats like singing
catches in their hearts like wind
the good things
strangers in their arms are bringing
makes life all right again.

They turn their faces to the light
no longer hiding in the night
so unashamed and unafraid
that they can face each others faults
and though the waltz will have its ending
there is no harm in just pretending
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

// Too Much To Ask //

The smiles as she walked in the room have all turned into frowns
Am I too quick to assume that love is no longer in bloom?
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune to what they did before
Her head's red raw and the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around
When you sobbed before it felt much more like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more
And no would be...

Oh, it's uncertain whether the curtain has shut for good
She says "See if it's still raining, I'm not dressed for it and if you loved me-"
Well I interrupted, received the scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there

Would it be outrageous to say we're either shouting or we're shagging, docked in tempestuous bays?
At least that's how it felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me like Sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask
It's a pity, it just hit me we can't go back to the chest touching on the back

// What If You Were Right The First Time? //

The mixture between,

The fantastic dream,

And the fear,

You wonder where she is,

This afternoon.


And does it get on your nerves,

Make you slightly perturbed,

That there's things that you don't know about her?

And even the places that she's never been with yer,

seem awful empty without her.


You can't look into those eyes,

Down no telephone line,

What if you were right first time? [x2]


The mixture between,

The fantastic dream,

And the fear,

You wonder where she is,

This afternoon.


You can't look into those eyes,

Down no telephone line,

What if you were right first time?

// You And I //

I like the way you look at me baby
Please don't try and turn on the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
Girl I'm in a muddle tonight
Would you tell me where you're gonna take it
If I had a heart you're the one who should break it

The engines running, can't decide if I should ride away
You and I
You and I

I had a woman, she went away
And now I'm lonely...Fuck it

You and I
You and I

You and I
You and I

Would you tell me where you're gonna take it
If I had a heart you're the one who should break it

The engines running, can't decide if I should ride away
You and I
You and I

You and I
You and I

You and I
You and I

I like the way you look at me baby
Please don't go and turn out the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
Girl, I'm in a muddle tonight

// You're So Dark //

You got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
You got your unkind of ravens
And your murder of crows
Catty eyelashes and your Dracula cape
Been flashing triple-A passes
At the cemetery gates

'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark

And you're so mysterious
Got that obsession with death
I saw you driving your Prius
And even that was Munster Koach-esque
You watch Italian horror and you listen to the scores
Leather-clad and spike-collared
I want you down on all fours

'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

I know you're nothing like mine
'Cause she's walking on sunshine
And your love will tear us apart
And I know I'm not your type
'Cause I don't shun the daylight
But, baby, I'm willing to start

You're so dark

Got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
Got your unkind of ravens
Got your murder of crows

You're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
But I want you hard
You're so dark, oh
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

I saw you dancin'
You moved like Sinatra
On speed

The lights were a-flashin'
And tongues were a-waggin'
Over you
It's too late for tryin'
It's too late for denyin'
All those little things
You and me have done
I'm sorry, hon'
I was hopin' for a recall
A mix of you high from the sun
Oh, but nothin'
Only lone magpies come

I saw you dancin'
You moved like Sinatra
On speed
