// Bigger Boys And Stolen Sweethearts //

There's always somebody taller with more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he's fit
And you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
Wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there

They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts 
Oh, you're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I know you were though

Now you don't know what she's up to you can only assume
If she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
Bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that's what he likes
I know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

But she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
She's looking at you funny rarely looking at you twice

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts 
Oh, you're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but it's so clear you were though

Have you heard what she has been doing? Never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gate at twenty past three
She's been with all of the boys but, never went very far
And she wagged English and science just to go in his car

They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched me bird and he'd probably kick my head in
Oh now the girls have grown
Yeah but I'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts 
Oh, I'm better off without her anyway
I said I wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I'm only pretending, you know
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know

// Choo Choo //

But don't you let her, don't you let her touch the tracks

I said she's setting off from platform four 
And they've decided that they're gonna let her drive 

Don't you let her, don't you know 
She's sick and tired of 
Being in the background, the passenger 
Let her drive the train, oh!

// Cigarette Smoke //

Get out the way, mister
With your short sharp tips
No, I won't read your lips right now
And baby, hey
You send a shiver down my spine
But do you read my mind
Do you...
And you're looking pretty suspicious
And probably planning a heist
He's wanting to go to the strippers
It makes him feel all nice

From tourists in trafalgar square

And now sting me... get in the groove

// On The Run From The MI5 //

Come and take a leaf out of my book
I'm a crack dealing crook
Selling lots of rock and roll to the masses
And I know if you wanna take a trip to the city
We can go (to Gibraltar)
We can go (to Gibraltar)

Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on

Give me your switch card - I'll book some flights

1996 And I'm stuck at the bottom of a truck
Got the road right in my..., got detectives
And I'll say if you catch me that I really wish
That I had stayed (in Gibraltar)
That I had stayed (in Gibraltar)

Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on

Give me your switch card - I'll book some flights

// Riot Van (Demo) //

We got thrown in a riot van
And the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin

Smoked a bong a last night
And stole somebody's telephone
He thinks it's all alright
But they've left him on his own, on his own

But baby stop calling
Over and over yeah
And give me some funny cigarettes
And do what they told you, yeah

Pinched a car with one headlight
And lost control the passengers were screaming
Made him shut his eyes right tight
And think of you, and hope that he was dreaming

Then up rolled the riot van
And called the fire brigade
But it was already too late
And there was no arrests to make
Ohhhhh!

But baby stop calling
Over and over yeah
And give me some funny cigarettes
And do what they told you, yeah

// Scummy //

So who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!

Although you're trying not to listen
I bet your eyes are staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
Sorry love I'll have to turn you down

And oh he must be up to something
Want half a chance to show he's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around

And look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous
And he don't have to say 'owt
She understands she's here to get picked up

And she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
She don't stop in the winter, no and...

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

What a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all

// Wavin' Bye To The Train Or The Bus //

Oh baby, I'm wanting to do you a swap
I'll give you anything, yeah
In return for the noises you've got
And I can see you want to be attended to
Just count to twenty-nine and I'll attend to you
Oh for sure... well certainly, yeah yeah yeah

Wavin' bye to the train or the bus
I'm ever so worried because...
I don't want to get all forgotten...

So very comfortable..
Don't really need to put up my feet,
And even in fat sam's grand slam,
Can't see it being easier to speak.
when you've karate-kicked your way to someone new
And I'm a memory and don't know what to do
All on his own...
Collecting his dole n' stuff

Wavin' bye to the train or the bus
I'm ever so worried because...
I don't want to get all forgotten...
Cause we know
Yeah, we know-oh-oh-oh
Oh we know, a woah-oh-oh

Don't know where we're going, baby
I s'pose it depends
But even if we're all far apart
We can all come back and all be fine
We'll be able to be together again

Be together again
Be together again
Be together again
...
Everybody will be together again!

// Stickin' To The Floor //

Won't somebody let me out?
Don't want to stick around no more
Sick of looking at you strange
Sick of sticking to the floor

Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya
Said not one of you, no

Well fuck it all and break your nose
If they keep on pushing you around
If they keep on stepping on your toes
And pick you up when you fall down

Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya
Said not one of you, no

Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya, no
Said not one of you, no

// Space Invaders //

Space invaders flying home
Yeah, they're going to hit the sack
And they are prob'ly going to die getting high
Cause they're mixing crazy moments with the crack
And she's kissing all the boys
She's to clever to be slack
But she's bound to go away for a day
In July, so she won't be coming back

Baby, baby, baby
The good old days have died
Baby, baby, baby
Now won't you dry your pretty eyes
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days are taxed
So come on!

Spot big bell bottom chords
And a matching with a hat
And you're a rule breaker, baby
Can't you see me standing
Only in your way to hit the sack?

And she's kissing all the boys
She's to clever to be slack
But she's bound to go away for a day
In July, so she won't be coming back

Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days have died
Baby, baby, baby
Won't you dry your pretty eyes
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days are taxed
So come on!

// Curtains Closed //

I so wanted it long but she cut it short 
And now I'm catching a cold 
I told you not but no crack in the doobie 
But it was already rolled 

Oh, I turned down my lights 
And my curtains weren't closed 
I turned down my lights 
And my curtains weren't closed 
Oh well, I turned down my lights 
And my curtains weren't closed last night 
Oh baby, I must be mad 

Well, I don't care about your massage oils 
It's got my skin going red 
Cause I'm a mad mother-fucker 
With my curtains open 
Sitting tucked up in bed 

I turned down my lights 
And my curtains weren't closed 
I turned down my lights 
And my curtains weren't closed 
Oh well, I turned down my lights 
And my curtains weren't closed last night 
Oh baby, I must be mad 

I turned down my lights 
And my curtains weren't closed 
Oh well, I turned down my lights 
And my curtains weren't closed 
Oh yeah, well I turned down my lights 
And my curtains weren't closed last night 
Oh baby, I must be mad

// Ravey Ravey Ravey Club //

She's the victim, well fuck all that we ain't goin home today
And she's been too much magic beans to walk all men away
And she's been eatin' too much magic beans to walk all men away

Yeah but we'll get around yeah
Yeah but we'll get around

Well everyones felling alright
