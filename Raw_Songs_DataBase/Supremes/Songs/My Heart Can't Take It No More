Stop hurting me
Now don't you think you're overdoing it
I still care I must admit
I know that if we ever break up
I know you'll never make up
And I'm sorry, so sorry
But my heart can't take it no more

How the times you lied
You know how many times I cried
Lonely tears brought me misery
Maybe one day you realize
Just how I really tried
Darling to make you happy

I gave my heart
You only took it and destroyed it
And now you say it's me you love
Yet you cheated and deceived me
And now you say you want to keep me

And I'm sorry, so sorry
But my heart can't take it no more
My heart can't take it no more
My heart can't take it no more
