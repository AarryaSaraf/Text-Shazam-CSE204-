// Ask Any Girl //

Being hurt by the one you love
It's a feeling that's hard to hide
But you don't seem to understand why
When I'm alone I sit and cry

Ask any girl
Who's often left alone
All by herself
Neglectfully pushed aside
Set aside like a doll on a shelf
Just ask any girl
Ooh, and you'll understand why
I sit and cry

Ask any girl
Who knows the fear of losing
Someone dear
And she'll say the same thing
It hurts you deep
Makes it hard to sleep
Don't take my word
Ask any girl
Then you'll understand why
I sit and cry

Ask any girl
Who receives no loving affection
And she'll feel as I feel
It's heartaches by the number
Many nights without slumber
Ask any girl
Ooh, and then you'll know why
I sit and cry
I sit and cry

// Nothing But Heartaches //

Nothing but heartaches
Ooh, nothing but heartaches
He brings nothing but heartaches
I can't break away from his arms
I can't break away from his charms
I can't break away from his kiss
'Cause his kiss I'll shouldn't miss

All my life 
I needed someone to need me
So I do my very best to please him
But the more and more I care
The more of him other girls share
When I need a hand to hold
That's the time he leaves me all alone
Just keeps me, keeps me crying myself to sleep

He brings nothing but heartaches
Ooh, nothing but heartaches
But I can't break away
Oh, no keep a loving him more each day
Oh, I can't break away from his arms
I can't break away from his charms
I can't break away from his kiss
'Cause his kiss I'll shouldn't miss

To him I'm loyal, to him I'm true
Why can't he be the same way too
But the more my love has grown
The less love he had shown

He makes promises he doesn't keep
Sometimes I don't see him all week
Just keeps me, keeps me crying myself to sleep

He brings nothing but heartaches
Ooh, nothing but heartaches
But I can't break away
Oh, no keep a loving him more each day
Oh, I can't break away from his arms
I can't break away from his charms
I can't break away from his kiss
'Cause his kiss I'll shouldn't miss

Nothing but heartaches
Ooh, nothing but heartaches
I can't break away, oh no
Keep a loving him more each day

// Mother Dear //

Something's on my mind
Mother dear the boy keeps me crying
Don't know which way to turn
Keeps me so confused
Keeps me so confused

Mother dear
'Cause for him I yearn
But he treats your daughter bad
Keeps your daughter sad

I wish I didn't love him so
'Cause now I can't let him go
His kiss gets a little sweeter
Ooh, my heart gets a little weaker

I'm falling deeper
Deeper in love each day
I know he's no good for me
But I'm too weak to break away

Ooh, each day love gets a little stronger
Ooh, heartaches lasts a little longer

Help, help me mother dear
'Cause I can't help myself
Ooh, he treats your daughter bad
Keeps your daughter sad

So many times I've tried
Telling him we're through
But when he takes me in his arms
There's nothing I can do

Ooh, it's no use
I can't break loose
I keep love him more and more each passing day
All my love to him I give it
Without him around
I couldn't live
I need him so
And he knows it
Can't let him go
And I show it

Help, help me mother dear
I'm so in love with him 
But he treats your daughter bad
Keeps your daughter sad

Help, help me mother dear
Help, help me mother dear
He keeps your daughter crying

// Stop! In The Name Of Love //

Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet

But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over)
After I've been good to you?
(Think it over)
After I've been sweet to you?

Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her, maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?

This time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever

Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart (Baby, think it over)
Stop! In the name of love (Think it over, baby)
Before you break my heart (Ooh, think it over, baby)

Stop! ...

// Honey Boy //

Brian Holland-Lamont Dozier-Edward Holland, Jr.

He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy.

Sweet kisses are his claim to fame
In my heart he'll always remain
True fine loving is his game
Honey boy is his name
He's sugar, he's spice
He's everything that's nice.

He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy.

I'd rather have a minute of his time
Than all the gold in the Fort Knox mine
My whole he inspired
Loving him is my desire
Always near when I need him most
That's why I love the boss.

He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy.

If you see me in my prettiest dress
It's for him I look my best
Nobody can take him from me
Because he has everlasting loyalty
He's sugar, he's spice
He's everything that's nice.

He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
Yes indeed.

// Back In My Arms Again //

All day long I hear my telephone ring
Friends calling giving their advice
From the boy I love I should break away
'Cause heartaches he'll bring one day

I lost him once through friends' advice
But it's not gonna happen twice
'Cause all advice ever gotten me
Was many long and sleepless nights

Ooh!
But now he's back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied

It's easy for friends to say let him go
But I'm the one who needs him so
It's his love that makes me strong
Without him I can't go on

This time I'll live my life at ease
Being happy lovin' whom I please
And each time we make romance
I'll be thankful for a second chance

Ooh!
'Cause he's back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied
Ooh!

How can Mary tell me what to do
When she lost her love so true?
And Flo, she don't know
'Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo

I listened once to my friends' advice
But it's not gonna happen twice
'Cause all advice ever gotten me
Was many long and sleepless nights

Ooh!
I got him back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied

Ooh!
I'm satisfied, yeah
So satisfied
I'm satisfied
I'm satisfied

// Whisper You Love Me Boy //

Whisper you love me boy
Say the words you seldom say
You love me more 
Each passing day
Whisper you love me boy
Just the way you used to do
When our love was true
It's been so long 
Since you held me in your arms
Ooh, the joy it brings 
Hearing you say sweet things

Whisper you love me boy
Make it sound soft and dear
Tender and sincere
Whisper you love me boy
Say it in your sweet way
The things I seldom hear you say
You used to say 
You love me the most
But now you hardly ever hold me close

Whisper you love me boy
Whisper, whisper

// The Only Time I'm Happy //

I just wanna be happy
To love and be loved by you

But the only time I'm happy 
Is when I dream of you each night 
Cause that's the only time 
You hold me tight in my dreams
Is the only time your love is mine.

Each time you're near 
Something happens to my heart 
You make you feel so unwanted dear
And it pains my poor heart
If I could feel your sweet caress 
Then I'd know true happiness.

But the only time I'm happy 
Is when I dream of you each night 
Cause that's the only time
You hold me tight in my dreams 
Is the only time your love is mine.

To me you'll never have 
Nothing kind or sweet to say 
Than my whole day 
To seem too sadly waste away 
But when the day ends 
All my happiness begins.

But the only time I'm happy 
Is when I dream of you each night 
Cause that's the only time 
You hold me tightly in my dreams 
Is the only time your love is mine.

Life pasts each day 
Leaving loneliness in my heart 
You make you feel so unneeded
And it hurts my poor heart
But there's nothing I'd rather do 
Than to be happy loving you.

But the only time I'm happy 
Is when I dream of you each night 
Cause that's the only time 
You hold me tightly in my dreams 
Is the only time your love is mine.

// He Holds His Own //

Say what you will about him
You'll never make me doubt him
He means the world to me
His love is all I need
Wealth he doesn't have
But he holds his own

Say what you will about him
But I can't live without him
It makes my life worthwhile
Watching his tender smile

Handsome he may not be
But he holds his own
He holds his own

Say what you will about him
You'll never make me doubt him
Though he's a soft spoken guy
A little quiet, a little shy
He has qualities
'Cause he holds his own
He holds his own
He holds his own

Say what you will about him
He holds his own
You'll never make me doubt him
He holds his own

// Who Could Ever Doubt My Love //

Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?

I've been falsely accused
Of being untrue to him
And it's not so
But it's the way he's misjudged me
That really hurts me so
When I've been nothing but good to him
Forsaking all others
Giving my love to him
Who could ever doubt my love?

A victim of circumstance I have been
But what really hurts is
Instead of believing me
He believed his friends
When I've been nothing but good to him

Rearrange my life to please only him
Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?

I've been cast aside
Because he believed someone's lies
After I've done the best I could
Still I've been so misunderstood
After I've been good to him
Good to him, so good to him

Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?

// (I'm So Glad) Heartaches Don't Last Always //

Tossin' and turnin' and losin' my sleep 
Cause heartaches by the number you gave to me.
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always.
But I'm so glad heartaches don't last always.

I feel uplifted and at ease
Since my heartaches went away
Someway, somehow I've gotten over you now
No more sitting by the phone
Mo more wondering if you're alone

Tossin' and turnin' and losin' my sleep 
Cause heartaches by the number you gave to me
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always

Getting over you was hard cause we were so close.
In the middle of sweet memories is when it hurt the most.
But I just kept on trying in between crying and ...

Tossin' and turnin' and losin' my sleep 
Cause heartaches by the number you gave to me
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always.

How happy I am now that I'm over you.
It's so wonderful this change in me.
How rejoiced I am to be over you at last no more ...

Tossin' and turnin' and losin' my sleep 
Cause heartaches by the number you gave to me
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always

// I'm In Love Again //

Love came through my window and right out the door
Leaving me alone and hurt forever more
Suddenly you came, you saw, you captured my heart
So tenderly you came to rescue in time this heart of mine.

Now no more by myself, no more hurt to be felt
And no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again
And no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again

Once in heartbreak I believed always in heartache
Lost in sorrow with little hope for tomorrow
Instantly when you smiled at me my heart stood still
All the emptiness I had inside you lovingly fulfilled.

I then felt born again and it feels so grand
And no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again
Now no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again
Now no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again.
