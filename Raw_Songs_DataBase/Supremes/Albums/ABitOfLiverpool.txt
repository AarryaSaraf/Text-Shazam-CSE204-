// How Do You Do It //

How do you do what you do to me
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you

How do you do what you do to me
I'm feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue

You give me a feeling in my heart
Like an arrow passing through it
Suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it

How do you do what you do to me
If I only knew
Then perhaps you'll fall for me
Like I fell for you

You give me a feeling in my heart
Like an arrow passing through it
Suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it

How do you do what you do to me
If I only knew
Then perhaps you'll fall for me
Like I fell for you
When I do it to you

// A World Without Love //

Please lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

Birds sing out of tune
And rain outside hide the moon
I'm OK, here I'll stay
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love's smile
He may come, I know not when
When he does I lose
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say 
I won't stay in a world without love

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love's smile
He may come, I know not when
When he does I know
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

// The House Of The Rising Sun //

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And God I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
Sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
The only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh, mother tell your children
Not to do what we have done
Spend your lives in chear misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl
And God I know I'm one

// A Hard Day's Night //

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it
To hear you say
You're gonna give me everything

So why I love to come home
'Cause when I get you alone
you know I'm feeling okay

When I'm home 
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you hold me tight, tight

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

So why I love to come home
'Cause when I get you alone
you know I'm feeling okay

When I'm home 
Everything seems to be alright
When I'm home
Feeling you hold me tight, tight

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I'll feel alright
You know I'll feel alright

// Because //

It's right that I should care about you
And try to make you happy when you're blue
It's right, it's right to feel the way I do
Because, because I love you

It's wrong to say I don't think of you
'Cause when you say these things
You know it makes me blue

Give me one kiss and I'll be happy
Just, just to be with you
Give me, give me, a chance to be near you
Because, because I love you

Give me one kiss and I'll be happy
Just, just to be with you
Give me, give me, a chance to be near you
Because, because I love you
Because, because I love you

// You've Really Got A Hold On Me //

She's alright
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you,
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need you
Oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend 
Another day here
Oh, I want to split now
I can quit now
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me

// You Can't Do That //

I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that girl again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Well it's the second time I've caught you talking to her
And it's the second time I've caught you being unfair
I think I'll let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can't help this feeling I'll go out of my mind
You know I'll let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that, oh

Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can't help this feeling I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

// Do You Love Me //

Do you love me?
I can really move
Do you love me?
I'm in the groove
Now, do you love me?
Do you love me?
Now that I can dance?

Watch me now (work it out)
Shake it, shake it baby
Work it out baby
Oh, shake it, shake it down now
Work it out now
Just a little bit of soul now

Oh, I can mash potatoes
I can do the twist
Now tell me baby
Do you like it like this
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Now that I can dance?

Watch me now (work it out)
Get it, get it, baby
Work it out
You're driving me crazy
Work it out
Just a little bit of soul now

Oh, I can mash potatoes
I can do the twist
Well, now tell me baby
Do you like it like this
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Now that I can dance?

Do you love me?
I can really move
Do you love me?
I'm in the groove
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Now that I can dance?

Watch me now (work it out)
Shake it, shake it baby
Work it out
Oh, shake it, shake it down now

Just a little bit of soul now

// Can't Buy Me Love //

Can't buy me love,

I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything my friend,
If it makes you feel alright

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
What I got
I'll give to you

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No no no no,
Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No no no no,
Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Can't buy me love

// I Want To Hold Your Hand //

I tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

Oh please say to me
That you will be my man
and please say to me
you'll let me hold your hand
Now, let me hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

// Bits And Pieces //

I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Since you left me and you said goodbye
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
All I do is sit and cry
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
You went away and you left me misery
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
And that's the way it'll always be

I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
You said you loved me and you'd always be mine
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
We'll be together till the end of time
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Now you say it was just a game
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
But all you're doin' is leavin' me pain

Time goes by and goes so slow
oh, yeah
It just doesn't seem true
Only just a few days ago
You said you'd love me, and you never make me blue

I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Now you've gone and I'm all alone
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
And you're still way up there on your throne
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
But nothin' seems to ever go right
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
'Cause night is day and day is night
