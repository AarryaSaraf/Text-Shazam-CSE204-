// Pretty Hurts //

Ms. Third ward, your first question – what is your aspiration in life?
Oh... My aspiration in life... would be... to be happy

Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says, "Bigger is better."
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says, "Thinner is better."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts (pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (pretty hurts), we shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst (pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

When you're alone all by yourself (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
And you're lying in your bed (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Reflection stares right into you (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)

You stripped away the masquerade (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
The illusion has been shed (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)

Yes

// Ghost / Haunted //

[Part 1: Ghost]

(The winner is Beyoncé Knowles: female pop vocalist!)
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston

And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mm

[Part 2: Haunted]

It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me

On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
Me, me, me

// Drunk In Love //

I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now, now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin'
On the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin', swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire

// No Angel //

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
Will you ride around with that H-town?
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want
Yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Let me hear you say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Give me some!

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower

High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

Driver, roll up the partition, please

Driver, roll up the partition, please

Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up

Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica-Lewinsky'd all on my gown

Oh, there, daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down

Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass

Red wine drip, we'll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash

Oh, there, daddy, daddy, now you ripped my fur

Hello!
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe ?
Le sexe, je veux dire : l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kind of girl you like, girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me

Hello!

Bzz-bzz-bzz-bzz-bzz-bzzwop

// Jealous //

I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this. No."

Take it one step further. Freakum dress out of my closet
Yoncé filling out this skirt. I look damn good. I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex. Said, "What's up?" to his besties
Now we're reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas. Don't be jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this. No."

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human, don't judge me

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

// Rocket //

Let me sit this ass on you, show you how I feel
Let me take this off, will you watch me
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch me, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch me, baby?
Grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know, that you, ready
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady

And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

So rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me

Hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Rock, hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady

Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it
I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn

I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now, yes Lord, damn baby
Driving me cra-, cra-
You ain't right for doing it to me like that daddy
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me, please
Punish me please
Daddy, what you gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face?
Yeah, hell yeah, ride me so deep
Ooh, my shit's so good that it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures, consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby-boomers, baby, baby, baby, baby
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddammit, I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin
Rockets and waterfalls

Damn

// Mine //

I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about break-ups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh

'Cause if we are
We're taking this a little too far
If we are
We're taking this a little too far
Baby if we are
We're taking this a little too far

With me being wherever I'm at
Worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

I'm out that H-Town coming coming down
I'm coming down, drippin' candy on the ground
H, H-Town, town, I'm coming down
Coming, coming down, dripping candy on the ground

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches (Crown!)
I took some time to live my life

Don't get it twisted, get it twisted

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls
"You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man."
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes

Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine, I'm flawless!

// Superpower //

When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower

(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Oh, like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, too much to bear
(Superpower)

And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we got plenty power
Nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down

// Heaven //

I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving

But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed

But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

So go on go home
Padre Nuestro
Que estas en el cielo
Santificado sea tu Nombre

Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive

Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you
'Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name

We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club, drunk in love

We be all night, love, love

No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11

If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy's toys

Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve
Uh, foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97 I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast

// Ring Off //

Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)

You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins

Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top

If you're going through it, just know it's called "going through it"
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive

// Blow (Remix) //

Nobody hotter than you
You know that I'm twerkin'
And give you somethin' that's worth it
But d-d-daddy that's perfect

All that ocean, can't you see it?

There's only one thing on my mind
I wanna love you long time
Want you to watch me while I wind
Want you to love me long time
We're just havin' such a good time
Over and over we find
With the flame lickin' at my feet
Kiss you while the sun kisses me

Can you feel the heat on my skin?
Can you feel, all my lovin'?
You and me

Can you feel my heart burnin'?
Can you feel all my good lovin'?

'Nuff gal a watch you, meh seh 'nuff gal a chat
But none a them can possess you the goodness you have
Wine fi me baby, wine and catch
When you get yah touch yah
Bus' a tic-toc yah
Una make me tun' up the temperature, tun' up the temperature
Tun' up the temperature pon you non-stop

I can't deny your desire
Feel like I'm on fire
When, you touch me
I feel the flame lickin' at my feet

Can you feel the heat on my skin?
Can you feel, all my lovin'?
You and me
We're standin' on the sun
Can you feel my heart burnin'?
Can you feel all my good lovin'?
You and me
We're standin' on the sun
(Feel everything
Standin' on the sun)
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
Feel everything
Standin' on the sun
