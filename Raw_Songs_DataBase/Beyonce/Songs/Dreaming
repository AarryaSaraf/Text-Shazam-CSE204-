When I'm here in your arms, I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinching myself, I don't care, I'm with you, you with me
I never wished on the star when the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams

When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
Oh

(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Oh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I'm supposed to be

When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
Oh

(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Oh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

It took a lifetime just to get with you, to be with you, baby
And now that I'm here with you, I'm gonna take it in, breathe you in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And if I am dreaming, let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I'd rather dream about you than living life without me and you, you

(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Oh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Oh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
