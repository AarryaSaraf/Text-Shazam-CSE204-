There's a storm within
And I don't want to let it end
I'll give you all control and
Let your love rain down on me

In my heart and mind
Is your love divine
I'm gonna let it flow
And let your love rain down on me

Gonna raise my hands and dance
Gonna give Him all I can
Everytime I call His name
His love rains down on me
Gonna lift my voice and sing
Of the love and joy He brings
Everytime I praise His name
His love rains down on me

When I was in distress
I needed happiness (Come on)
So I got down on my knees
And asked you to comfort me

I know that thunder brings the rain
So I called your Holy name
And you washed away my sins
Gave me new life again

Gonna raise my hands and dance
Gonna give Him all I can
Everytime I call His name
His love rains down on me
Gonna lift my voice and sing
Of the love and joy He brings
Everytime I praise His name
His love rains down on me

Love is raining down on me
Joy is deep inside of me
Praise; I'll lift my hands to thee
Cuz your love, your love
Love is raining down on me
Joy is deep inside of me
Praise; I'll lift my hands to thee
Cuz your love rains down on me
