Ah yeah
Time to come back home y'all
Come on, come on, come on

For God I'm a slave
To get to heaven
Reverend said I gotta be saved
And behave
And also stuck in my ways
Give Him praise
Words can't express what I feel inside of my flesh
Every breath is giving Him glory until my death (I feel blessed)
'Cause everyday I'm seeing Him work (I feel blessed)
I don't wanna do no more dirt (I feel blessed)
If the path I was on was wrong (I feel blessed)
It's time to come home

It doesn't matter where you been
Or what you did wrong
It doesn't matter who you are
You're always welcome
It only matters that your heart believes
And you confess
If you committed any sin you'll be forgiven

Calling on all of God's children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I've been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)

Come on home
Come on come on home
Ooh yeah yeah
Come on home

If you can't see your way out
And you're drowning in your regrets
If you have everything you want
But you still can't find happiness
It's when you feel like you're forsaken
Life can be so hopeless
Maybe you need to come home
So your life can be cleansed

Calling on all of God's children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I've been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)

Don't bare the burden all by yourself (By yourself)
The Redeemer's here He's gonna give you help (Give you help)
Come unto Him and He will give you rest
For any heart that's heavy laden
Soul salvation, ooh

Calling on all of God's children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I've been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)

My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms
My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms

Calling on all of God's children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I've been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)

Don't you know it's time to come home
Deliver me
I've been rescued by the Saviour
Don't you wanna be in His favour

My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms
My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms
My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms
My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms

Time to come home
