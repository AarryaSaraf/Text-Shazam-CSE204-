The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got (Tell me more)
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
But all the while, inside, I knew it was real (Ooh)
The way you make me feel

Lyin' here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more, more and more (More and more)
Let's give love a try (Let's give love a try)

Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts of love will find
True love in a special way

Oh, ooh, oh, ooh, the closer I get (The closer I get)
Closer I get to you, baby
The more you make me see (The more you make me see)
More you make me see
By givin' me what you got, oh yeah
Your love captures me (Your love captures... woo!)

Oh, over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
When all the while inside I knew this was real (Got to be real)
Got to be real
They you make me feel

You know, you know, you know
My baby, my baby, my baby
My love
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)

(Come closer love)
Come a little closer so that we can see
Into the eyes of love
I want to see into those eyes of love
(Come closer, love)
Just a little closer let me speak to you
I want to softly tell you something
Here I am, here's my love, I just want you to
(Come closer, love)
Come a little closer let me whisper in your ear
'Cause I wanna tell you something
I wanna whisper in your ear so softly... so come closer, love (Come closer, love)
Move on in real close so we can celebrate
The way we feel a bout each other's loving
I wanna tell you words, words of love
