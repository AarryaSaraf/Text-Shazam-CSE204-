Took me a while, but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about out my friends mouth
I've been beat down
'Til he turned my life around
(Turn my life around)

Seems like I always fall short, of being worthy
'Cause I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shining on me
(No no no no no)
'Cause I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
Loves me

I used to wake up some days, and wish I'd stayed asleep
'Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the worlds on top of me
Everybody's got opinions (they share)
They ain't been in my position (they don't care)
That it breaks my heart when I hear what they
Have to say about me yeah (what they say)

Seems like I always fall short (falling short)
Of being worthy (Lord I ain't worthy)
'Cause I ain't good enough (no no)
But he still loves me (still loves me)
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar)
The spotlight ain't shining on me (but I want to be for you)
'Cause I ain't good enough, but he still loves me

I'm not perfect (I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong (yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best (trying my best but)
But it ain't good enough (just ain't good enough)
Shunned by the world (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed, 'cause I ain't good
But he still loves me (I just ain't good enough)

If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed
To be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
'Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without out blame

Feels like we always fall short, of being worthy (we are not worthy)
'Cause I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)
The spotlight ain't shining on me
'Cause I ain't good enough, but you still love me

I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best but (trying my best)
It ain't good enough (I'm not good enough)
Shunned be the word (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed (I don't succeed-ceed-ceed)
'Cause I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
(Child sing with me)
I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best but it ain't good enough
(But the Lord's been so good to me)
Shunned be the word (Shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
'Cause I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (The Lord still loves me)
No I ain't good enough, but He still loves me
(Raise your hands if ya understand)
No I ain't good enough (How he blessed you 'cause he blessed you too)
But He still loves me (even though I ain't worthy)
No I ain't good enough (you ain't worthy, He's there for you)
But He still loves me (no matter what I do)
No I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (but the Lord still loves me)
