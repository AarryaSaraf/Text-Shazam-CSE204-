Ooh, when I was a little boy
(When I was just a boy)
And the devil called my name
(When I was just a boy)
I say now who do
(Who)
Who do you think you're foolin'?
(When I was just a boy)
I'm a consecrated boy
(When I was just a boy)
I'm a singer in a Sunday choir
Oh, my mama loves me
She loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me

Oh, she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like a rock of ages and loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me

When I was growin' to be a man
(Growin' to be a man)
And the devil would call my name
(Growin' to be a man)
I said now who do
(Who)
Who do you think you're foolin'?
(Growin' to be a man)
I'm a consummating man
(Growin' to be a mad)
I could snatch a little purity
Oh, my mama loves me
She loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me

She loves me like a rock
She rocks me like a rock of ages and loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me

And if I was President
(Was the President)
The men of Congress call my name
(Was the President)
I'd say who do
(Who)
Who do you think you're foolin'?
(Who do you think you're foolin'?)
I got the Presidential seal
(Was the President)
I'm up on the Presidential podium
My mama loves me
She loves me
She gets down on her knees and hugs me

Like she loves me like a rock
She loves me like a rock of ages and loves me

She love me, love me, love me, love me
She love me, love me, love me, love me
She love me, love me, love me, love me
She love me, love me, love me, loves me
