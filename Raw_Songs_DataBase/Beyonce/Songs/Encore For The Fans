I wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. And it came so effortlessly after I finished the film of my life, "Dreamgirls". Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics. This is "Listen"
