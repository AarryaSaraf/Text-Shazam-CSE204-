Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

'Cause everywhere we looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away

Halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo

You hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere we looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, we can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can see your halo
I pray it won't fade away

Your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo
Your halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo

Yeah, everywhere we looking now
Surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, we can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away
