Don't fight the feelin

Girl when you see me flexin' in my beamer or in the Jaguar
The crush we have is a feelin we have meant for each other
So don't fight the feelin
It's a feelin
That we both be needin

Come here stranger
Come and dance with me
Listen life changer
Don't fret take a chance with me
Cuz when you move like that, I can just fall
Mmhm
In love with you
You think I'm speeding
That's until you see
I wasn't I was leading the future for you and me
Cuz when you move like that I can just fall
(Uh huh)
In love with you
Baby close your eyes
And move
Baby please don't think
Just groove
Please
Do that for me
Let them know
You're my baby
It's weird I know
But somehow I know
I've handin you
And you've been handin me
It's like some fantasy
I like you
I want you
Dance with me
Forever and ever
