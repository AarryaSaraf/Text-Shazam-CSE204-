Baby, I see you, that look in your eyes
Hips that keep shaking, mysterious style
Exotically tempting, familiar to me
That Creole sexy, it's all over me

So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole

(Creole!) When I look real good
(Creole!) Whenever I talk real good
(Creole!) Whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know, that's your secret
(Creole!) When she look that good
(Creole!) Whenever she talk that good
(Creole!) Whenever she bounce that good
Ladies, if you wanna know, this your secret
Creole!
Bad, bad, bad, bad yellow bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad red bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad brown bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad to the bone

For all of my brown bones
That make a good broth
And all of my red bones that make a good sauce
The yellow bone flavor is familiar to me
Mix it all together; it's a delicacy

So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole

(Creole!) When I look real good
(Creole!) Whenever I talk real good
(Creole!) Whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know, that's your secret
(Creole!) When she look that good
(Creole!) Whenever she talk that good
(Creole!) Whenever she bounce that good
Ladies, if you wanna know, this your secret
Creole!
Bad, bad, bad, bad yellow bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad red bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad brown bone
