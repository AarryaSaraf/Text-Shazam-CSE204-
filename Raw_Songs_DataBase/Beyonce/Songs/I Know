Mmm
Yeah-yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh-yeah, ooh, no-oh
Ooh, mm, ooh, mmm

Hey little lady, why you walkin' wit' your head hung low, mmm?
There's gotta be an answer to whatever you don't know, yeah
Got 'little man' in the stroller lookin' up at ya
Don't understand but he knows his mama's sad
Why ya runnin' away when your problem's gonna find you?
Dry your eyes and take the time to pray

'Cause I know what you're goin' through
Don't let it get the best of you
Everybody goes through things
Don't worry, it will be okay
I know what you're goin' through
Don't let it get the best of you
Everybody goes through change
And made it through yesterday

Whatever happened to livin' in a world of peace, and equality, oh?
Wantin' the same, yet we killin' one another for greed, and jealousy?
We got 300 million men and women out there who love someone (someone)
Epidemics got our nations dying young
You better be ready when He comes

'Cause I know what you're goin' through (I know what you're goin' through, "yeah yeah, yeah yeah")
Don't let it get the best of you (no no no)
Everybody goes through things ("everybody goes through things")
Don't worry, it will be okay (don't you worry, it'll be okay)
I know what you're goin' through ("yes, I know it will, oh")
Don't let it get the best of you (no no, "no no")
Everybody goes through change (no no, yeah-eah)
And made it through yesterday

Now, don't you let it break you down
(Don't you let it)
And don't you let it steal your joy
(Break you down)
I know it's gonna be
(Don't you let it)
Alright, yeah
(Steal your joy)
Don't you let it
(I know it's gonna be alright)
Keep on fightin'
(Just don't give up the fight)
Oh, oh
(Everything will be okay)
As long as you keep Him first, don't worry, no no
(Don't you let it)
The pain that you're goin' through
(Pain that you're goin' through / break you down)
Just for a little while
(Just for a little while / don't you let it)
Hold on, hold on
(Steal your joy)
Hold on
(I know it's gonna be alright)
Don't let the situation steal your joy
(Just don't give up the fight)
Keep your head up, keep the faith
(Everything will be okay)
Say yeah, yeah-yeah
(Yeah yeah)

'Cause I know what you're goin' through (oh-oh, I know what you're goin' through)
Don't let it get the best of you (don't let it get the best of you)
Everybody goes through things (everybody goes through change, yeah)
Don't worry, it will be okay (yeah)
I know what you're goin' through (I know what you're goin' through)
Don't let it get the best of you (let it get the best of you, oh)
Everybody goes through change (and made it through)
And made it through yesterday
'Cause I know what you're goin' through
Don't let it get the best of you
Everybody goes through things
Don't worry, it will be okay
