Oh, baby
Oh, baby

I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights
You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me lets me know you're mine

I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you?
Boy, don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you, whoa
There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you
Baby, I love making love to you
It's like a high I can't come down from you

I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name (Scream my name)
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

I'd rather be with you, oh, yeah
Boy, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, oh, yeah
Boy, I'd rather be with you

I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way (Make me feel good)
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)
