Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I'm going fast
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to tear my body apart

Living loving I'm on the run
So far away from you
Living loving I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I'm going fast
It's only just a moment
But she's turning paranoid
It's another situation for a nervous boy

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I'm going fast
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, I just can't take any more

Living loving I'm on the run
So far away from you
Living loving I'm on the run
So far away from you

Ooh! I'm on the run
