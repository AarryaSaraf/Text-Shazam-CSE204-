Well we had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
We're meeting all the groovy people
We've rocked the Milky Way so far

We danced around with Borealis
We're space-trucking 'round the stars

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space-trucking
Come on, come on, come on

Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way
We'd move to the Canaveral moon stop
And everynaut would dance and sway

We got music in our solar system
We're space-trucking 'round the stars

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space-trucking
Come on, come on, come on, yeah

The fireball that we rode was moving
Now we've got a new machine
Yeah yeah yeah yeah the freaks said
Man those cats can really swing

They got music in their solar system
Rocked around the Milky Way
Dance around with Borealis
They're space-trucking everyday

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space-trucking
Come on, come on, come on, yeah

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space-trucking
Come on, come on, come on, yeah

Let's go

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space-trucking
Come on, yeah, come on, oh, yeah

Space-trucking
