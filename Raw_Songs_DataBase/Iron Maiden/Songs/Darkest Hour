We buried our sons, we turned and fled
No growing old, the glorious dead
But we came back because one man said
Now on the beaches the blood runs red

I faced them down, the only one
I stood alone and warned the day would come
But they were wrong, appeasers every one
And not for the last time, we all stand alone

I watch the sun move away as I embrace the night
And my black dog has its day for six long years you shall not pass
Barbarians at the gates, we will overcome

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped
The whirlwind before the dawn
The darkest hour
The darkest hour

To blaze in glory like a dying sun
One last burning giant till Jupiter moves on
Turn the ploughshares into swords
You sons of Albion awake defend this sacred land

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour
The darkest hour

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour
Before the dawn the darkest hour
