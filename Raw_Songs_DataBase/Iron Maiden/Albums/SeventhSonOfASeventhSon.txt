// Moonchild //

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own, Lucifer's my name

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal

I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die

One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

// Infinite Dreams //

Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again

Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end and will I transcend?
Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep

Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well me, I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end?
In Heaven or in Hell?

Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams

There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again

// Can I Play With Madness? //

Can I play with madness?

Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place

Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha)
He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to see
Said you're too blind to see

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said "Don't lie, don't say you don't know"
I say "You'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next"
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said "You wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"

Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha)
He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to see
Said you're too blind to see

"Listen to me," said the prophet

Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha)
He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to see
Said you're too blind to see

Can I play with madness?

// The Evil That Men Do //

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

The evil, the evil
The evil that men do
The evil, the evil
The evil that men do

// Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son //

Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one

Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the Evil, which path will he take?
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers, before it's too late

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman, the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done

// The Prophecy //

Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster, it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed

Why won't you listen to me?
Is it so hard to understand?
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends

Suffering and pain, impending disaster
Souls crying, the Devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits

I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my vision
Heed what I say and you'll see what will be
Please listen to me

Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame on to me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
Knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future, I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed?

Purgatory beckons, souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs, Hell awaits

I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late

// The Clairvoyant //

Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this a dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes?

I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying

Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
...and be reborn again?

// Only The Good Die Young //

The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed

Time, it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
Time, it waits for no man
My fate is sealed

If I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays

The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate

Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us and look through our eyes?

Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?

So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
