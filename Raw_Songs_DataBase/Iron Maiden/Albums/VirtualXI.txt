// Futureal //

I'm running out of my time
I'm running out of breath
And now it's getting to I can't sleep at night
In the day, feel like dead
I'm getting in far too deep
I feel they're closing in
I've got to say that I'm scared
I know they'll win, even so, I'm prepared

Do you believe what you hear?
Can you believe what you see?
Do you believe what you feel?
Can you believe what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal

Wherever anyone seems to treat me like a freak
It makes me see I'm only one
Who feels that I know what is real
Sometimes it feels like a game of deadly hide and seek
And when you're reading this
Then I will be gone
Maybe then you will see

Do you believe what you hear?
Can you believe what you see?
Do you believe what you feel?
Can you believe what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal

Do you believe what you hear?
Can you believe what you see?
Do you believe what you feel?
Can you believe what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal

Futureal, what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal, what is real?

// The Angel And The Gambler //

Roll of the dice
Take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now
So how do you feel?
But you're not gonna win
You'd better go back again

Do you feel lucky or do you feel scared?
Take what luck brings and the Devil may care
But you're down on your luck
And what will the next day bring?

Adrift on the ocean
Afloat in a daydream
Or lost in a maze
Or blind in the haze
So what does it matter?
So why don't you answer?
So why did you send an Angel to mend?

Best make decisions, before it's too late
Take all your chances
Take hold of the reins
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again

Nothing to lose, but so much to gain
A little danger, it goes without saying
But what do you care?
You're gonna go in the end

Gate open to Heaven is ready and waiting
Or straight down to Hell, can go there as well
I'll suffer my craving
My soul's not worth saving
So why don't you go?
Just leave well alone

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

There's like a hunger
That knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it
Still you want more
You've made your mistakes
Won't play it the same again

You have been warned but
Still you plunge in
You play high stakes
But there's nothing to win
You've only one life
And so many things to learn

The Angel on one side
The Devil the other
Which path do you take?
Decisions to make
Arrive on the crossroads
You know where you're going
And what if you wait?
It may be too late

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

// Lightning Strikes Twice //

I feel the breeze on my face in expectance
Not very long before the storm reaches here
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
Feel something strong as the power draws near

Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you?
Is it the clashing of clouds that hold fear?
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone
It takes me back to my childhood again

And as I wait and I look for an answer
To all the things going round in my head
I ask myself, could it be a disaster and when
It's maybe threatening to happen again?

As the ominous light draws near
There's a lone dog howls in the park
All the people hurry inside
As a lightning flash lights dark
The storm is nearly here

Only God will know

You're sitting alone, you watch
As the wind's blowing treetops
And the swaying rusting of leaves
Plenty of time to perceive
As you wait for rain to fall

Only God knows
The whole sky glows

Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice

Only God knows
The whole sky glows

Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice

// The Clansman //

Wake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a race
That is part of a clan
And to live on highlands
And the air that you breathe
So pure and so clean

When alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be free

Is it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans

Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am the clansman

Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

It's a time wrought with fear
It's a land wrought with change
Ancestors could hear
What is happening now
They would turn in their graves
They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
Has been written in chains

And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman

And I swear to defend
And we'll fight to the end
And I swear that I'll never
Be taken alive
And I know that we'll stand
And we'll fight for our land
And I swear that my bairns
Will be born free

And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what I want
I am the clansman

Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

[2x]
No, no we can't let them take anymore
No we can't let them take anymore
We've the land of the free

No, no we can't let them take anymore
No we can't let them take anymore
No we can't let them take anymore
We've the land of the free

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

Is it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans

Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am the clansman

And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman

Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman

// When Two Worlds Collide //

My telescope looks out into the stars tonight
A little speck of light seems twice the size tonight
The calculations are so fine
Can it be growing all the time?

Now I can't believe it's true
And I don't know what to do
For the hundredth time I check the declination
Now the fear starts to grow
Even my computer shows
There are no errors in the calculations

Now it's happened, take no other view
Collision course, you must believe it's true
Now there's nothing left that we can do

When two worlds collide
The anger and the pain
Of all those who remain
Two worlds collide
Who will be left alive
No place to hide

When two worlds collide
The anger, the pain
Of those who remain
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
So who will survive
There's no place to hide
When two worlds collide

Now it's happened, take no other view
Collision course, you must believe it's true
Now there's nothing left that we can do

When two worlds collide
The anger and the pain
Of all those who remain
Two worlds collide
Who will be left alive
No place to hide

When two worlds collide
The anger, the pain
Of those who remain
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
So who will survive
There's no place to hide
When two worlds collide

When two worlds collide
The anger, the pain
Of those who remain
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
So who will survive
There's no place to hide
When two worlds collide

When two worlds collide
The anger, the pain
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide

// The Educated Fool //

I'm an educated fool
So I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do
About this awkward situation
That's been forced down right upon me

As I'm walking down into
On my own into the valley of life
Got a lifetime of experience
Yeah I've got so much to give

Open the page at chapter one
Could this just be that life's just begun
Forever within your darker thoughts
Reflecting on everything you've been taught

Never felt this way before
Seems that somebody's just opened the door
To the book of life... or is it death
Is there ever any way out

Someone's looking down on me
To the very inner core of my soul
They won't tell me what they see
But I really want to know

I want to live my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires
I want to go and see the fire burn
I want to see and feel my world turn
I want to know what more there's to learn
I want to pass the point of no return

Do you really wanna be
Just another one statistic or feel
That you really should aspire?
That you really do deserve more?

Do you ever really feel
That you have so much potential inside?
What you really have to give
Could be realised so much more

I want to live my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires
I want to go and see the fire burn
I want to see and feel my world turn
I want to know what more there's to learn
I want to pass the point of no return

Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow

Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow

I want to feel what life's like respond
I want to meet my father beyond
I want to walk right into the light
I want to feel no fear but delight

I want to live my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires

Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow

Time will go
But I will follow
Time will go
And I will follow

Time will go
But I will follow

// Don't Look To The Eyes Of A Stranger //

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night comes down

Feel someone's watching you
You've got to get away
Is it the first time you've ever felt this scared?
Feel the adrenaline pump
Your heart begins to race
Begin to run now
The sweat runs down your face

Don't know which way to turn
You'd better hide yourself
He's getting close now
You'd better improvise
Just hope you never reach the point of no return
Could be the last time you see the light of day

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night goes down
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down

Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger

Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger

Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger

Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger

Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger

Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night goes down
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger

// Como Estais Amigos //

Como está, amigo?
For the death of those we don't know
Shall we kneel and say a prayer?
They will never know we care

Shall we keep the fires burning?
Shall we keep the flames alive?
Should we try to remember
What is wrong and what is right?

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos, no more tears

And if we do forget them
And the sacrifice they made
Will the wickedness and sadness
Come to visit us again

Shall we dance a dance in sunlight
Shall we drink a wine of peace
Shall our tears be of joy
Shall we keep at bay the beast

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos, no more tears

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Inside the scream is silent
Inside it must remain
No victory and no vanquished
Only horror, only pain

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos, no more tears

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos, no more tears

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
