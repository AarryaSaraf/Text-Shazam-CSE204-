Album: Rainmaker

// Rainmaker //

When I was wandering in the desert
I was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
I turned my face towards the barren sun

And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in our lives
Like the cracks upon the ground
They are sealed and are now washed away

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears

And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in the ground
Like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears

And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in the ground
Like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away

// Dance Of Death (Orchestral Version) //

Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace

Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals

And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them
They had ascended from hell

As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead

Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me

By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled

I ran like hell faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead

When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Drink and say a prayer for it

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead

// More Tea Vicar //

More tea vicar?

In the day of the dawn
Let me tell ya

The vicar's made his mind up
In his leather underwear
He was a vicar Reginald
But now he's not so sure
Y-fronts!

He was a vicar Reginald
But now he's not so sure
It's just a front he's putting on
A Y-front!

He was surplus to requirement when the anthem starts to play
He fiddled with his organ on the Sabbath Holy Day
Yes he did!

He was surplus to requirement when the anthem starts to play
He fiddled with his organ on the Sabbath Holy Day
Ya!

Vicar's made his mind up in his leather underwear
He was a vicar Reginald but now he's not so sure
Huh, yeah!
Huh, fuck!
Hey!
Pass the soap!
Huh!
More tea vicar!
More tea vicar!

Gimme more tea vicar!
Oh yeah!
Yeah, huh!
More tea vicar!
Yeah, ho, yeah, ho yeah!
More tea vicar?
More tea, ho, hah!

Beg your pardon?
More tea vicar!

Now he's just made more tea
That doesn't work does it?

Surplus to requirement when the anthem starts to play
He fiddled with his organ on the Sabbath Holy Day
Oh, dear!

More tea vicar!

And be it just a Holy Day
Then I start to find
I've got a dog called Reginald
But then he starts to whine
Huh, hoh!
Yo bitch!
More tea vicar!

Huh!
Lick my bone!

Yoho! Hey! Ha!

More tea vicar!
Young man, you're uncouth!
Without couth!
Pass the tea!

Now that you've just had your tea, get on the way to go
Pass the tea and pass the soap lad
Now it's pass the soap?
Pass the soap?
What sort of?
I'm not down with that at all!

More tea vicar!

Jive talkin', doo doo doo!
Jive talkin'!
Ah!

No, no, no! You got the wrong track
You have to go in the studio next door

OK!
Thank you!
Got rid of him anyway!
More tea vicar!

// The Wicker Man (Live) //

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

The ferryman wants his money you ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat as you set up off the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

// Children Of The Damned (Live) //

He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of The Damned

He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all
Children of The Damned 
Children of The Damned 
Children of The Damned 

Now it's burning his hands he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on ground what did we learn

You're Children of The Damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
You're Children of The Damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight
Children of The Damned
