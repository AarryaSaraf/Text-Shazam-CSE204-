// Wildest Dreams //

1, 2... 1, 2, 3, 4!

I'm gonna organize some changes in my life
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go

And I just feel I can be anything
That all I might ever wish to be
And fantasize just what I wanna be
Make my wildest dreams come true

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
Out on the road again

When I remember back to how that
Things just used to be
And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery
I felt I'd disappeared so deep inside myself
I couldn't find a way to break away my hell

When I'm feeling down and low
I vow I'll never be the same again
I just remember what I am
And visualize just what I'm gonna be

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
I'm gonna break away

I'm gonna break away
I'm out on my own
I'm out on my own
I'm gonna break away
Breaking away

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
Out on the road again

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
I'm gonna break away

// No More Lies //

There's a darkened sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a last horizon
But no regrets from me
Maybe I'll be back some other day
To live again just who can say
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for me
A hurried time no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No-one can stop me now
Time is up it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Someday maybe I'll wait till then

No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!

They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet
So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you
The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is ever clear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home

No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!

A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusions
And wishing all your life away
No-one can stop me now
Time is up it couldn't last
But there's more things I have to do
I'm coming back to try again
Don't tell me that this is the end

No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!

// Montségur //

I stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocents, evil took place
The angels were burning inside

Centuries later I wonder why
What secret that they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion still burning inside

At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross

Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars to die and be free

The book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan his weapon is lust
Living this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of life
The perfect would willingly have died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of god they had claimed
Religion still burning inside

At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross

Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars to die and be free

As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross

Facing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars and to die and be free

At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

// Dance Of Death //

Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the Everglades
I'd one drink but no more
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures – they were undead – all of them
They had ascended from hell

As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me

By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled
I ran like hell, faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead

When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Have a drink and say a prayer for it

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead

// Gates Of Tomorrow //

Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights

To the women and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you
If you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on

Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you
If you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on

Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow

// New Frontier //

Bleeding you dry from the start
The sum of my parts
To give it away
New life in a day
Some new Frankenstein
Damned for all time
Cursed by the angel who fell
Who saves me from Hell?
And who is my god?
And where is my soul?
Too tired to jump, too young to run

Never-ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start

Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man

I want to end my life now
But I don't know how
Recycled again, a lifetime of pain
The spawn of a man
The Devil has planned

Never-ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start

Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man
Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man

Never-ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start

Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man

Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man

Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man

// Paschendale //

In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale

Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years

Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale

Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go

Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale

Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale

// Face In The Sand //

Everybody's waiting for something to happen
Everybody's waiting for something to see
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters
Everyone's waiting for news on TV
Winding lives at the end of the spiral
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill
Everyone's looking but no-one is listening
Everybody wants to be in at the kill

I wait for the signs, they tell me true
I see the signs of the end of time

Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing
Everyone's looking for the reason why
Everyone's hoping for life ever after
Everyone's looking at death from the sky

Everyone's nightmares are going to happen
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes
Everyone's praying but no-one's believing
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies

I wait for the signs, they tell me true
I see the signs of the end

So I watch and I wait and I pray for an answer
An end to the strife and the world's misery
But the end never came
And we're digging the graves
And we're loading the guns for the kill

Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand future memory of our tragedy?

So I watch and I wait and I pray for an answer
An end to the strife and the world's misery
But the end never came
And we're digging the graves
And we're loading the guns for the kill

Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand future memory of our tragedy?

// Age Of Innocence //

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathising with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all

And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war

So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have?
Don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream

A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victims' minds are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low

So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have?
Don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream

You can't protect yourselves, even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals, they laugh right in our face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace

Despondent public worries where it all will end
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend
We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have?
Don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream

The age of innocence is fading like an old dream

// Journeyman //

From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death and he has cheated us
But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping and we'll dream forevermore

And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deeper grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

But the memory still remains
All the past years, not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around

In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

Spare your life and you choose the destruction of time over yourself

In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun
Yeah!

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
