// Areyoudown? Pt. 2 //

[Saba:]
Ayy, yeah

J.G. Wentworth, it's my money, so I need it now, ayy
I pulled up, I got my windows up, my speakers loud, ayy
Granny left too soon, if only she could see me now
Walt right off 2-90, I might go and see him now
I see them act like they cannot see when we around, ayy
I forgot what hate feel like, I cannot keep around, ayy
Bro, on papers if it's drama, we can't be around
I don't make assumptions, I asked her if she is down
Are you down then?

Are you down for whatever? Down, we not with the talkin'
Down for whatever nonsense, no, we don't do the drama
Are you down for whatever? Down, we not with the talkin'
Down for whatever nonsense, no, we don't do the drama

If you make less what you spend, then that is not alright, ayy
All these niggas hittin' women, that is not alright, ayy
I dared hip-hop to be different, they say I'm alright
Fifty million independent on my Spotify
Listen from the start to ending, you can't spot a lie
My key unlockin' the doors, I just crossed off all my goals
Prophecy profitable, I might deposit a boat
I'm from Chicago, the go, they quick to cock it and blow
And whether from Austin or Low, I made them hop at the show
They call me Saba the Goat

Are you down for whatever? Down, we not with the talkin'
Down for whatever nonsense, no, we don't do the drama
Are you down for whatever? Down, we not with the talkin'
Down for whatever nonsense, no, we don't do the drama

[Tobi lou:]
I don't really do no drama
I don't really listen if you ain't my mama
My lil' bitch got that ill nana
And my president still Obama, bitch
It's tobi lou and Saba, bitch
You don't really want no problem, bitch
Y'all can not tell me nada, bitch
I'm hotter than Atlanta
I'm feelin' like Kawhi (Kawhi), I think I could fly (Goodbye)
I don't have no ceilings, Southside in the building
That bitch hurt my feelings, yeah, that bitch hurt my feelings
Thought we had a real thing

[Saba:]
Are you down for whatever? Down, we not with the talkin'
Down for whatever nonsense, no, we don't do the drama
Are you down for whatever? Down, we not with the talkin'
Down for whatever nonsense, no, we don't do the drama

// Back In Office //

Young Sebastian back in office
Slipped out of the back in a flyin' saucer
"Christelo where we at?" declinin' offers
I hear niggas rappin', can make salsa

Tomato, tomato, it's all sauce-less
This feel like Draino to y'all faucets
Superhero, this my negro, sauced this flow
They hear my shit, and then adopt it like a foster home
My granny workin' hard, the main person I call upon
Gold chain hang from my collarbone
I was the same guy in her college dorm
And I ain't never had a college dorm
Body like a bottle, and that skin tone terracotta
I'm from Chicago, we invented mobsters
Some call me "Saba", others call me "Saba"
As long as it's love, it's not a problem
I like I'm Ã“scar de la Hoya
Fuck is y'all lookin' at?
Hot potato, oil, I can fry the game or boil
They like "Fuck is y'all cookin' crack?"
Got niggas askin' "Is it jazz? Or is it rap?"
I'm a bit imaginative, I'm where the ribbon at
In the sky I can write like Jack Kerouac
I can say anything, it don't even have to match
I can wear anything, it don't even have to match
When it comes to rap peers, I don't even have a match
Like a smoker lookin' for a light, patch in they jacket flaps
Raised by the old schools, G-Pop in they Cadillac
That's-

Young Sebastian back in office
Slipped out of the back in a flyin' saucer
"Christelo where we at?" declinin' offers
I hear niggas rappin', can make-

This is for the amateurs, this is where the master rap
Some of them not amateurs, but next to me they sound like that
My city like Gotham, but no, I am not Ben Affleck
Turn your head into a fraction, yeah, they will take half of that
I am not a hunter, but I grew up in that habitat
Life a uphill battle, but for me was more a avalanche
Stackin' up the bread, now I need everything I haven't had
Milly after milly, they gon' hit me like I'm Bangladesh
Cole passed on this beat back in 2009
I was but a young lad waitin' to have my time
Knew that one day my story be celebrated
I guess I'm still waitin', so fuck it, I'ma take it
Love myself enough, I can dodge through the stunts
Actin' like a ruler, but can never measure up
Knew myself enough, I never questioned what I was
Manifested paradise and I was in the hood
Ten years plus now I been this good
Honey on me now, she heard about the buzz
Signs should say "Keep out", the dawg's on the hunt
Label try reach out, that's every other month

Young Sebastian back in office
Slipped out of the back in a flyin' saucer
"Christelo where we at?" declinin' offers
I hear niggas rap, tell 'em "Take caution"

// Beautiful Smile //

[Saba:]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Watch it there, watch me ayy
Watch me ayy, ayy, ayy

I got a beautiful smile, honestly I forgot how
Since I put my boy in a box, sometimes I see him in the cloud
I been away for a while, I'm in the bay, in the town
Niggas debating 'bout who is the greatest
For what you debating about?

Niggas aching for clout, I know
Niggas who run in yo' house, without stakin' it out
If you ain't really 'bout, shit that you say you about
I went in a different route
I just go pivot the couch
I just envisioned the count
Then I go get that amount
I got a beautiful house, but honestly I skip the town
Anytime that the temperature down
So someone dissed me in a crew, but honestly I forgot who
'Cause niggas is snakes and what's crazy
Is that it's somebody I probably knew
Me I don't get it, no clue, that's just some shit you don't do
That's just some more shit I add to the list
That I can't give no energy to
Watch what you put up on the web
You don't want everyone aware
I just had to leave the hood
'Cause motherfuckers treated me like a celeb
I just went and cut my dreads, but I got some beautiful hair
I am just searchin' for something that's real
'Cause this shit really not what they said

I got a (Beautiful) smile, but honestly (ayy) how
I put my boy in a box, sometimes I see him in the cloud
I been away for a while, I'm in the bay, in the town
Niggas debating 'bout who is the greatest
For what you debating about?

Ayy, yeah
I swear that it's always something
Guess what? I always want something (ayy)
I swear that it's all assumption (ayy)
Here out they always want something

[IDK:]
I got a beautiful condo
Stacking my bread for the house next
Labels keep tryin' to sign me
They do not have the amount yet
See I come from a place where them niggas don't usually amount shit
Boarded up houses across from the suburbs
That's causing a feud like the north and southern
A fight for the slavery re-cost society
Got 'em runnin' in your mother's, house (how?)
'Cause they under your covers, there's no one to cover
That's pointin' they guns as they're runnin' for cover
The news ain't gon' cover, there's nothin' to govern
When niggas keep fighting and killing each other
To deal with each other for dealin' to others
Dealin' with the facts, make a nigga wonder
Who gon' have my back when the storm thunder
He gon' take the white, cook and make it butter
Ain't no thinking twice, he don't ever stutter
Money in his sight, runnin' to them numbers
That's the finish line, right before he crosses blue and red lights
Central booking cover 25 to life
Something like his cousin, that's the way of life
Nothing's ever promised but I got a-

// Black Astronaut //

Black astronaut, forecast report
How they actually thought that you wouldn't find your way
That matters not, it's an act of God
Can I tag along, now that you're in outer space? (Outer space)
Now that you're in outer space

Ayy, can I please breathe, three feet, no pressure
Ayy, soon I'll hit stratosphere and that'll lower the pressure
We diggin' for a happy that is deeper than depressions
From eagles in the deserts, assaults with a deadly weapon
But we leave it all behind with our other worldly possessions
No rocket ship to rally behind, so we reinvested
My time spent in buying shit that doesn't even mesh with me
I'm see through, but insecurities need they confessions
I needed space, once I seen the world, I got demons to purge
I wanna be the girls of my dreams' same dream to my girl
We were shorties, and all it took was a wink and a curl
To fall in love we didn't even need to speak or be worried
Or sneak in a hurry to keep she from hurtin'
Like sheep that were herdin', I hope we moved on
So hopefully when you thirty you move differently
The cool kid in me is a new temperature
New wave like the moon shifted me, now enters the-

Black astronaut, forecast report
How they actually thought that you wouldn't find your way
That matters not, it's an act of God
Can I tag along, now that you're in outer space? (Outer space)
Now that you're in outer space

Black astronaut, in the class is shy
So, when the teacher roll call, ya name forgot
Had words by the few, never had a lot
But you knew that your mind wasn't the average
Like abra-cadabra, we made all of our doubt disappear
We used to be invisible, that was a different year
It appeared different peers tried to kill me with ideas
That whatever I would do was far from cool or fittin' in
Loneliness struck with a slight chance of rain
Black astronaut, they don't like you in space
Bright blue the day, find my terrain
Dare I to say, I'm on my way

Black astronaut, forecast report
How they actually thought that you wouldn't find your way
That matters not, it's an act of God
Can I tag along, now that you're in outer space? (Outer space)
Now that you're in outer space

// Excited //

Ah
Ay, yeah

All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science
Yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous
Yeah, I get so excited
All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet

I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous
Yeah, I get so excited

'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait
I said I be on the road
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait

Ayy, ayy, look
Heard your shit, it is not fire
New shit coming like a tidal wave
Been in that booth like five whole days
Chicago survival rate
I'mma keep it jazz like Johnny 'Trane
Y'all niggas countin' everybodies lane
Saba like [?] oh my god, ay
But I drop hits like Johnny Cage
Stage dive nigga, no shirt, red alert
And I'm from the same city, like Dirk, can't revert
To the same shit that make a baby burp
All gas, no brakes if I do I'll wanna skrr
Her favorite rapper Cardi so she told me "Okurr!"
And if I'm at a party then I'm first
I don't wanna judge, no this is not church
But if she wanna touch, the decision's hers
I may dance on another planet, Richard Branson

All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science
Yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous
Yeah, I get so excited

I be on the road
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait

If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait

// Footaction Family Cypher //

[Saba Pivot:]
Yo it's Saba and you're watching the Footaction Family Cypher

[KR:]
From the boondocks
In the back of a bat cave
Lies a black slave
I ain't concerned with these whips and the nice chains
Nice brains from dimes don't need em
Loose change
I make a salary from me spittin these hot flames
Cold hitta, prolly go shirtless in cold weather
Stack money, rhyme, elevate, that's my vendetta
I'm sleep catch z's every fall like 6 letters
The rhyme chill you try to jack it like my sweater
Look, take a dive in the lyrical rap
The rat pack
Get cheese never get trapped
I'm a threat so they back back
Flow nasty the whole world resemble Kat Stacks
Professor of this ish
School you boys like back packs
Open doors full of bars
Valet parking the car
Scurry and fuck a broad
Pop a pill to f-loss
Holy presence of God
The messiah the great Allah
Watch em resemble me
Lost in the knowledge you see
This the type of flow you need to mop
Lyrics they will never stop
While you're drinking on that peach Ciroc
I'm finding my peace with Pac
Apocalypse is hot the block is hot
Lil Weez I spit a flow I bet you freeze
I got the honey's because I beeess
The hottest MC to ever achieve
The things I believe
And I got red eyes chasing the green
The green is the leaf
Hearing me speak the sighs of relief
The lyrics the beat
Put me in the mood to start a killing spree
Fuck a empty stomach
I'm starving I'm tryna eat
Got an entree full of rappers
It's time to begin a feast
Why the labels signing rappers who can't even stay on beat?
Like that
And it's sickening killer flows of delivery crack
And I'm shittening
Oops I meant to say shittin' with gnats
Boys bickering
But I remain a mystery
Like Scooby Doo
So I do me, you should do you too
Boys clueless foolish and stupid like Boo Boo the fool
Ooooooouuuu

[Bizzy Crook:]
This is Kurt cobain meets 2Pac at Barnes & Nobles
You all talk but I'm anti social I could swim thru the money playing Marco Polo fly
Rebel I go Han solo I stay in a good fit, gold chain And some Fly
Denims My kick game like the 5 venoms Ya BMs DMs I'll slide in them I
Swear I'm going in Like a two time felon I'm under rated but that's
Your mistake Cause while you sleeping on me Shorty up late telling me
How much she love the the tape I never hate I just mediate The sound
Track to my life got no skips I just let it play I'm tryna own it They
Tryna clone on it If they would've asked me nicely I would of loaned
It Instead I ain't gon give them a chance Better watch what you say to
This young Avalanche I stay on track like a Nike fuel band So many
Gigs I need more data man Ya plan A only work when u don't got a back
Up plan I fall down, and I get back up man

[Jimi Tents:]
Man I swear
I can jump off of a building
Leap over rooftops
Glide over ceilings
While sealing my soul in a pyramid
King tuts descendent
Sending a note
Through a time portal
Nailed to the sail of a boat
If my album was for sale
Will it fail? Will it float?
Like parades, out of space
In this game but I'm close
To the rim, like Dwayne or some spokes
Holy water for my sins
Jesus chain for the rope
Church roof as stool
Play the fool, it's a joke
Leap of faith on face
I'm deranged and I know
That the day will approach
That I'll slip & I'll fall
Hollow tips hit his jaw
Call em lacy duvalle
Hold up, wait...
Let me pause...
Play, sipping re (d) wine
Spitting four words
Moving forward
On demand, like a order
Not an Hors d'oeuvre
Homie I can do this all day
Lantern to a lamppost
Where ya damn coat?
Wear ya damn coat, cause the camp cold
You just damn dirt in a compost
This a calm post, let ya mom know
Ya saddam know, we the bomb
Oh, where the congos?
I'm the king, where did kong go?
You a console, game boy
Getting controlled by the council
Count bread, but I lack toast
Bussing lactose on her back slow
Bitch I'm lazlo, lead the camp like a masco-
Oww, a mascot
Basquiat mixed with Van Gogh
Tryna tango to merengue
Been a sensei, since the tenth grade
Tummy empty, I'm an MC

[Saba Pivot:]
There were clones wanna bes like a copying machine
I'm me like wayne before you bought the carter 3
Copying then They paste I control alt delete
Authoring
Opportunity will call let it ring
Let it go
Let my people go Moses when I sing
When I see
People scared to be they self
I'm just me
Setting by example when it's ample y'all following
Tryna trend
Finals mvp I'm just tryna win
I had a dream that I had a run in with the law
The same dream I was in a magazine
Hoping I don't mess it all up
Never been wack Look my catalog up
Never pitched crack but the adderall plug
Looking out for me like nanny or cub
I been in the game but I just made dub
All them boy lie and they shit made up
What is ya problem
Kept this shit 100 like change for a dollar
Pimping this game got a cane and a collar
Best rapper living bitch I'm Wayne on the carter
Smooth young nigga and it came from my father
Bitch I'm from Austin
Westside cautious
Approach with
Roaches
Smoking
Wrote this on off day
And still sound better than most shit
Oh shit
Gottem in check like coaches
That's Nothing but the truth
True so help me God
I'm aite
But I see it differently since Relly died
Really I
Never cared much about fitting in with y'all
When it all
Comes down to it I can do it on my own
Wrote a song
For the free I might sell it for the fin
Put it on iTunes
Putting on for the fam
I'm just chilling with my dogs
Like its Jake like I'm fin
Tryna tell the whole story
From the start til the end

// How You Live //

[Saba:]
Guess who is back in effect
I push this rap to the next
Level the lap I get check
Catch a body on tracks like a cannibal neck
I'm from where Hannibal at
They try to silence me
You cannot can the vocab
That's their plan of attack
But I speak and then leave em with panic attacks
And I don't mean the disco
Get 'em at the barber, Brisco
I sip the tea like the brisk cold
I turn your stage to a shit-show
Mosh pit, pop shit, missile
Mosh pit, pop shit, missile
Get em out the bread like Swindle
Niggas steady talk and I ignore

[Mfn Melo:]
Shawty told me I was young, what that is?
That's to
Get down how you live
Get down how you live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
I, I can't go along with this shit
I'ma get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how you live
Get down how you live

[Saba:]
Independent like a politician
Who not democrat or republican
Still I'm droppin' wisdom like a dentist
Finger-fuck the game, I'm never with it
Ritalin, you should really pay attention
Gimme this shit I don't need a gimmick
Put me in a guiness, afterall
They tried to put me in a box
And I don't mean to ship it
This shit way too easy
Listen to my last year CD
I don't hear a difference
Between what these niggas spittin' now
Just now hip to what I been about
I done hide and check my whereabouts
Dumb it down, he did it for the clout
Hundred round, I go and air it out
Same Chicago that ya'll hear about
Champion my name up in the banner
Till I'm going gray like David Banner
All this shit organic on my grandma
Let me talk my shit like on the panel
Panama these niggas wanna trade
My life lookin' different everyday
Oh I'm up next like I got a bouqet?
I can't pay attention what they say
I can't let it get to me (No)
This shit don't mean shit to me
They waitin' on me to blow up as if I ain't fail chemistry
But I see it differently
'Cause me and my niggas we got it out the mud
And I mean that literally
And I'm major, even without a major
This is not the little league
Fuck

[Mfn Melo:]
Shawty told me I was young, what that is?
That's to
Get down how you live
Get down how you live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
I, can't go along with this shit
I'ma get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how you live
Get down how you live

Better know that life you livin' change
You can bet I got it different ways
Been a day
Churnin' lemonade
Blessin' pour it never Minute Maid
Uncle, Daddy know he for the kids
Uncle Drew he OG pivotin'
Showin' love make a hater quit
Ware him out like your latest fit
Niggas get finessed they call it 'biz
I cut back off finesse and karma rig
Thought I learned my lesson 'till was quized
Filled it up, graded on the bitch
Rhyme to well, made it my niche
I remember workin' early shifts
No more retail, shop my business
Time will tell how they witness
Boxes was stackin'
As soon as I'm freed
Then it's back to the booth with no slackin', man
Pack, I was packaging, now I charge you
Knock on wood that I'll never go back again (Uh)
Came dropped the ball with this hit
'Cause you know pivot what it is
I'ma get down how I live (Aye)

Shawty told me I was young, what that is?
That's to
Get down how you live
Get down how you live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
I can't go along with this shit
I'ma get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how you live
Get down how you live

// Monday To Monday //

Honestly I think that 24/7 a understatement to my day to day
If ain't no way then imma make way
Naysayers say it ain't no way
I ain't never listen
Kept em at a distance
This is for the ones who ain't afraid
And this is more than some paper chase
I wonder who else can say the same
Never worried bout what they attain
If I'm living then I really can't complain
Can't contain who you really are
I know my true colors like this ain't a stain
Hustle hard like a MMA hit
Innovative
Didn't do it all in a day spent
But if they did we ain't hating
Look, I go double or nothing I'm just here to gamble
On my grind like my name was Kareem Campbell
Built it from the ground up like I just went camping
My name should be hand in hand with Thor's hammer
Remember when I couldn't afford dinner
Losing weight I'm getting more thinner
Saw it coming like a lesson planner
All the glitz and glamor critically acclimated I grew it on my own my organic
Now my agent say we tour planning
World renown like Michael or Janet
Got it out the ground like growing granite
Gracious I can't take a day for granted
Never looking down and never panicked
Only kept my thought on being great
And that's what I attracted like a magnet

I hustle from Monday to Monday
Knew that I would get it some day
Got me feeling like Lebron James
Wasting time bet that's what some say
Remember when they didn't want me
I knew I was on to something
10 to 10 what my alarm say
A.K.A. Monday to Monday

Imma' put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Micro, macro
Imma' put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Macro, macro

Like a vision board I see with clarity
I hustle like my name was Gary V
For more than the wealth and prosperity
Accountants was talking bout equity
I'm Triple H giving a pedigree
That mean that I'm special my specialty
I put in the work till I'm dirt in the earth
Or moving furniture to Beverly
I cannot stress it I just let it be
I want it all I am not settling
I'm on the move like I was settling
Failed a few but I ain't sweating it
They say success is like the best revenge
I can't kick it with no pessimist
Know it's my time that ain't tentative
Monday - Monday talking 10 to 10

I hustle from Monday to Monday
Knew that I would get it some day
Got me feeling like Lebron James
Wasting time bet that's what some say
Remember when they didn't want me
I knew I was on to something
10 to 10 what my alarm say
A.K.A. Monday to Monday

Imma' put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Micro, macro
Imma' put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Macro, macro

// Mrs. Whoever //

Yeah
Way I see it I'm top 10
I never let a motherfucker try me nah
I'm feeling the pressures I'm like a diamond y'all
My family straight I'm getting what I need all
10, 000 hours I put the time into it
All of the emotion that I felt
You hate me then you hating on yourself
My hand around her waist I'm like a belt
Wealth so hard to get
Keep it anonymous
Cause once the public figures out
Targets ain't hard to hit
So proceed with caution
They'll be supporting
For things ya fortune can get
To be from Austin,
You see he God sent
To be so fortunate

Mrs. Mr. Whoever I pray
All the time, All the same
Sadly I see things I thought would change
All the time, All the same
I don't want shit I just called to say
How's your day? Can't complain
My phone open to you all today
Work two ways

I'm tired of motherfuckers hitting me up like you never hit me up
Well that's what's up
People be focused up on the accolades
People you call your friends get to acting up
It's sad as fuck
Never satisfied
People that I looked up to I'm passing by
Doing everything I said I would be doing
You never hear a nigga say that Saba lied
Since a pacifier and the crib
I was mad inspired as a kid
No she didn't want me back then
Now she Caroline in a ditch
Took it as a lesson
We don't wanna rush in
Took her to a restaurant
Now she is undressing
I said it would happen
That was manifesting
And she threw it at me like a penny to a freshman aw

Mrs. Mr. Whoever I pray
All the time, All the same
Sadly I see things I thought would change
All the time, All the same
I don't want shit I just called to say
How's your day? Can't complain
My phone open to you all today
Work two ways

// Nice For What Freestyle //

I wanna know who mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight
Hold on, hold on
I keep lettin' you back in (lettin' you back in)
How can I, explain myself?

Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me (Murda on the beat)
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me (A song for y'all to cut up to, you know?)
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me (yeah)
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

I'm about to change my lines tell 'em adios
Pivot gang down for life, Shawty Lo
Aye, run this shit untill I get a charlie horse
Aye, fe fe on the block she look like mardi gras
Aye, married to this shit I mean that's common law
Kinda raw plus I got that soul like a commodore
Aye, commandeer I'm about to take this shit back
Aye, at yo' head you 'bout to get yo' head snatched
Aye, what they do for cash look like fear factor
Aye, but I ride 'round 'em surround 'em like I'm Cleopatra
Rack it up, rack it up I just got paid at the show this shit addin' up
Thinking of packin' up
Like I could retire right now and they had enough
I had my managers, I tell 'em we should go U.S. to Canada
They hit me back like 'Saba consider' but then they calendar
Shout out the el illest
Shout out the critics who wait for the beat to drop
Shout out TheNeedleDrop
Don't care what you writin' 'cuz I know that we on top
If that show up, then how he up when you ain't up?
My dirty vans, I just clocked in I'm on this work
I panoramic, see the bigger picture first
I Ray J in the booth, because I hit it first
Just did another right now records give us merch
Boy, all I drop is classics in my city merch
Can't lie, I'm pretty public for an introvert
Didn't cry, I'm right back to it if it didn't work
And I, look like I serve the block
I know you heard the todd
The greatest, I soon to occur to ya
We never heard of ya
Murda on the beat but I'm not a murderer
I'm who you learn about
History repeat and I feel it's like so many me's
Niggas talking we hear bits and piece
And it look like dinner, it's a feast
Middle finger to the CPD
Yelling "free my niggas" 'till they free
I don't wanna kick it in the street
They can catch a boot like Tennessee
Tell 'em paid in full like Eric B
And I'm telling you to care for me

// Papaya //

Oh, aw

[Saba:]
I wanted you while you were
With your guy but that beside the point
The fruits of the labor, papaya
One day we'll split the 'paya and maybe enjoy (Aw)
Your brown skin turns blue, under the moon
You know I don't smoke, but you fired the joint
I just want to chill (Chill), with you
I ain't got shit to do, I was hopin' you'd join (Aw)

[DaedaePIVOT:]
Runnin' there don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)
Runnin' there don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)

[Saba:]
I said that just my baby babe
While the clock go tick, flavor flay
Back when they offered me pay to play
Like, look at this long way we came
Some of the greatest turn Jay and Dame
And they split when the seasons change
But I know it won't be that way
If ever I see the day you by my side like a [?] pole
I see you in my peripheral
Albeit I don't need no stethoscope
I'm tellin' you shit I ain't ever told no one
I know you know me very well
And love you barely felt, before most times I'm fairly sure
We'll end up in fairy tale
Tutorial, you'll show me how, how can I be with you
Slide on the AM kick
Pinch me, I must be dreamin' still
If we gon' chill, I been in that corner, I'm spinnin' that wheel
You gon' come out when I text you, "I'm here"
Your boyfriend mad, now you here with the bill

I wanted you while you were
With your guy but that beside the point
The fruits of the labor, papaya
One day we'll split the 'paya and maybe enjoy (Aw)
Your brown skin turns blue, under the moon
You know I don't smoke, but you fired the joint
I just want to chill (Chill), with you
I ain't got shit to do, I was hopin' you'd join (Aw)

[DaedaePIVOT:]
Runnin' there don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)
Runnin' there don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)

[Saba:]
Ayy, but I hope she don't cat like Garfield when you get this invite
Love like gettin' hit with a semi
Don't judge too much with the pen, right
'Less you by my side, then it's alright
Had a few bros off of the insight
Know you dozed off after the midnight
I stayed up tryna wait for riplight
You went to bed, you ain't even say goodnight (Hahaha)
But that's my baby, like I'm ballin' though, young dumb and broke
Ayy, said that's my baby, like I'ma claim her, like in that Maury show
Get that baby like on my way tonight, baby stay the night

I wanted you while you were
With your guy but that beside the point
The fruits of the labor, papaya
One day we'll split the 'paya and maybe enjoy
Your brown skin turns blue (Blue), under the moon (Moon)
You know I don't smoke, but you fired the joint
I just want to chill (Chill), with you
I ain't got shit to do, I was hopin' you'd join (Aw)

[DaedaePIVOT:]
Runnin' there don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)
Runnin' there don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)

// Plead The .45th //

[Smino:]
I like to exercise my right to remain silent, please
I plead the .45th, 'cause this shit is beyond me
How their words don't mean anything
City of haters, city of demons (Ooh, ooh)

I wanna love all of y'all, but I don't think it's enough Tylenol
I'm thinkin' 'bout callin' off, I'm tired as fuck and I'm noddin' off
Surrounded by narcissists, my noose is moving through the contusions
They see my hue and they wanna do me, just like Huey P. Newton
I got a laundry list of lessons in Chicago lost
Runnin' from pagans, running with Reagan, now they with Donald Trump
I don't take nothin' too personal, play 50 Cent now my Kurtis Blow
Gold grill and a greasy throat, no peace to the PDO

I'd like to exercise my right to remain silent, please
I plead the .45th, 'cause this shit is beyond me
How their words don't mean anything
City of haters, city of demons (Ooh, ooh)

[Saba:]
They say they love all of y'all but that's to get the the deposits off
I was a child meanwhile my grandfather playing Ahmad Jamal
While niggas incarcerated, cops still living above the law
The city so cold, I had to leave out quicker than the car defrost
Westside Chicago, dodging a pothole, know I can die tomorrow
Cause that's the reality, this shit ain't no peachy or tangerine
They cover it up a catastrophe
A couple of em' killed by the badge, at ease
This shit is a war, never had no peace
They pulling me over, harassing me
So I'd like to see all of them bastards bleed

[Smino:]
I'd like to exercise my right to remain silent, please
I plead the .45th, 'cause this shit is beyond me
How their words don't mean anything
City of haters, city of demons (Ooh, ooh)

// Rich Don't Stop //

Don't stop

She say the shit don't stop
Tears don't stop
At home scared so the fear don't stop
Speaking of the crib
Nigga rent don't stop
Don't stop

And the fear don't stop
The kids don't stop
That's why she overdrive swear sis don't stop
Cause the rich don't stop
Yeah don't stop

Okay
Text don't call
Fail don't fall
Yeah the grind one of a kind like a damn snowball
I put gang in my name like I am Mozart
And if they saying you a stain no they ain't gone wash
Wash my soul
Watch my bro
We were both struggling
How he cope
He need dope
Give me no substances
I get on
He get caught now he gone for a minute
I ghetto my household was the oldest one here
It ain't no fear up in my eyes
They was tryna catch me like fireflies
Whether westside or the southside
They'll televise I'm top 5
Dead or alive like Killa Cam in a pink mink
What I tell the guys
I metamorph
Fuck around might teleport
I tell the sky
Racking the list we were stacking the grip
To give back to the crib
Like Colin Kaepernick on a knee
In the midst of being from where you have to get rich
Whether passing assist or grabbing a
Sack and a stick to attack were you live

She said the shit don't stop
Tears don't stop
At home scared so the fear don't stop
Speaking of the crib
Nigga rent don't stop
Don't stop

And the fear don't stop
The kids don't stop
That's why she overdrive swear sis don't stop
Cause the rich don't stop
Yeah don't stop

Don't stop
Microphone hot
I forgive my enemies because they know not
White collar job that's like a bowtie
Meanwhile we just let the whole week go by
Thinking bout the past that I've grown from
Focused on the bag bat that's a homerun
Falling from the cliff with nothing to hold on
I'm just like you look how I put my clothes on
Yeah a lot of niggas quit just cause the road long
A lot of people fear what really goes on
A lot will follow doubt I think they chose wrong
You're only talking loud just cause you're unsure
I said the grind don't stop till my vitals stop
I was 18 but I know my mind was a lot
More ready for the world, worldwide won't stop
Got too much to keep it moving for I won't stop

She said the shit don't stop
Tears don't stop
At home scared so the fear don't stop
Speaking of the crib
Nigga rent don't stop
Don't stop

And the fear don't stop
The kids don't stop
That's why she overdrive swear sis don't stop
Cause the rich don't stop
Yeah don't stop

Staying at home, I'm lowkey
We can all rise or fall, this ain't before
The fame is taking over

I don't know so and so, I don't assume you do
Hop out a Volvo, that bitch go vroom vroom
I'm with my dogs, dogs, they'll go woof, woof
You niggas all bark, bark, but they all poodles
Anything for dough, your bro sold his soul
Back up in effect, she told me that I am up next
Might get me tatted on her neck, it ain't no cattle for the set
You wanna battle, then how much you wanna bet?
Put a hundred thousand on it, yeah, yeah
Got the plate with salmon on it, yeah, yeah
Every day a ceremony, yeah, yeah
I feel like Tim in San Antoni-o
I flip the flow the flow, the same as before
At least a plus four, gang, you know
I never went alone to no nigga show
I don't be on the phone, you ain't my bro
Better come correct with the quote, mm
I ain't made a mill', but I'm close, mm

Industry a bitch I mean a big bitch I mean Norbit yeah
Blinded by the glitz I'm getting tired it must be more to men
Jewelry jewelry foriegn car your foriegn broad imported yeah

Fake it till you make it camouflaging all facades aye
Personal opinion don't amount to what our God say
Tell the kids go farther when they house don't have a padre
Bottle water when I rap
Grew up never drinking from the tap
I was so sick of these airports till covid hit the map
Now we're too sleep at this point
We even tired of taking naps
I lost close friends to a drug binge in hopes I can bring em back
Momma said this the revelation
Doubters all looking for resolutions
Everyone buying in desperation
On a good note there's no air pollution
Mane our reflection is over the seven seas
It's clear that we want it all eyes on we watchu see

Yea
I see something in the water
They don't lead us but they follow no surprise the ship goes down
I see something in the water
Ain't no subtle way to call it you get caught up and it goes down
I see something in the future
They don't like us but they use us we ain't stupid niggas slow
I see a bunch of niggas moochin off what other people doing
And it really hurt my soul damn

// Stay Right Here //

[Saba:]
Mm, ayy, yeah, ayy

I woke up this morning feeling just like I'm a star
No I don't drink but I might buy the bar
Like shots on me because I ain't get shot
That's on my soul, Diana Ross
I am on my pivot like I am Ross
I am a force to be reckoned
Like a western film, might pull up on a horse
This is the part where the party is over
But you and your friends know you will not go home
This for my niggas who went and got fired
Just 'cause they desire to grow their hair long
I just said peace to the past like "so long"
I don't smoke weed yet they passing the bong
Chiefin' the reefer just like Cheech and Chong
This for the teachers who told me that songs won't go a long way
But I'm a long way from home because of it, ayy
Look at this love that I'm covered in, ayy
Built from the ground up, a architect
I present just like a scientist
I'm in this, I give just 'cause I am blood, yeah
Opposite of what they government
I protect people that show me their love, yeah

[Xavier OmÃ¤r:]
So just stay right here
Love me from the mountain to the grave right here
Ain't no way it's ever gonna change right here, yeah

[Saba:]
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me

I said I pivot like my name was Ross
Pivot, Diana Taurasi
Pivot like Moss, he all squeak
I'm with a army, audience applause
Ain't been the same since Walt's autopsy
I just wish that I could call him, tell him 'bout tour
Tell him how shit not the same like before
Tell him how labels knockin' at the door
Tell him about how my face in The Source or somethin'
Call upon the Lord to come my Autumn
Though I'll never get to see the day
That my daughter come, ignore the dumb
Shit that come with the territory, share the story, all of 'em
Even with the little twist like Oliver all of the time
I told the block y'all should open your eyes
I come from nothing but drugs and the crime
I sung out, oh yes I made it alive
Shouts to the fans and they gave me some time, yeah
Look at the love that I'm covered in
Capital Hunnid our covenant
This is all real, ain't no supplement
Own all my masters and publishing
Head to Korea, they fuck with it

[Xavier OmÃ¤r:]
So just stay right here
Love me from the mountain to the grave right here
Ain't no way it's ever gonna change right here, yeah

[Saba:]
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me

[Mick Jenkins:]
Look at all of the love around me, astounding
How niggas still found the time to hate my county
Been cookin' niggas that look like me
We all got bounties on our heads and business is bountiful
My niggas accounted for
Two accountants to run my checks and balances
I never bank on balance though
We stay good with the handy work
But if I can't see a callous that can't be worth a dime
They say that a dollar'll make you rich
But that fake shit can't be worth the time
I got a eight to my face when I have the time
Smoking these days just to pass the time
Smoking sometimes just to stare in your face
Or just to stare in the mirror, I'm scared of standing in place
Even the slowest of paces
Keeping you on the move, it behooves you
All this mindless behavior we're used to
I kick it like Bruce Lee, I be like the water I'm deep in this year
I'm a young Fela Kuti whippin' a hooptie, we smoked out
Boys at the corner store loc'd out
We stop at the corner store anyway
Look at all of the love around me

[Xavier OmÃ¤r:]
So just stay right here
Love me from the mountain to the grave right here
Ain't no way it's ever gonna change right here, yeah

[Saba:]
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me

Tell em' I'm the man, little did they know, Vow Venus
Rap meanest demeanor, fuck a page up my penis [?]
Picture from pluto, I'm on future shit that you chose
Kudos you kudos, you little dogs I'm a bigger part
I'm that unanimously called the best but I'm not bitter dog
Just better than every single little bit of y'all
Filled of frost, on that Wendy's city shit
Dropping classics on some Pac & Biggie Shit
And my pocket big [?]
Like Ash Wednesday, rap is in a basement still
Cadence that kill, savin' a lil', for
Studio time, my shit sounded like the majors with deals
On high school, on itunes comparing my shit like yo
This who y'all like dude?
Name: N.A. Badu
With the fam like Caillou, listenin' to Badu
Killa Cam and [?], watching T-Mac vs. Ivu
Yo, Poetry in motion how my haiku's movin'
Fan base universal not just high school students
Fuck a targeting audience, everybody nod to this shit
And I'm callin' it quits
If they tell me that my message lacks enough direction
I'm the voice of the city that's the fuckin' vessel
And y'all ain't bleedin enough to be competing' with us
So who better than me could literally be the leader
I'm Peter Petrelli, a hero
Good in the hood like Pelli Pelli, I'm ready to rock
Like Redman fran, drop shit like confetti
Drop bodies they deadly
Go with the flow like Levy, Levi ready, rockin' steady
Hush little baby don't you cry
Look, huh
Mockingbird, y'all gon' learn
On, top of my game, that's a surfer
M, Like clockstoppers I'm about to, go
Uh, I skipped college no honor, roll
M, that dream changed now I'm on a, roll
Like arts and crafts, I'ma make it, that's on my, soul
Like poltergeist I stick out I'm a porcupine
I'm about to be problematic for any rapper that's trying
To get money this year and the following
Huh, standing on my own ground like I'm carpeting
Car full of 5 and that's followed by 4
Uh, Travelin'? Nah, nigga D. Pivot Swole
Send in guard, send in coal
In denial up in the pose I been denied in the post
I probably get struck or stuck, in the dough
That tennis, tennis I been in venice, I been invented
08' invented [?] Sonic sensus, until I'm senseless
That's doing numbers I'm all about business all my niggas
About to eat, devour beat like this shit so delicious!
Doctor Lipschitz, since a rugrat, on the move like hubcap
When they ask: Where yo buzz at?
I done came a long way and out a long town
Uh, I been on the waiting list the long line
Uh, steady stayin' patient I know it's alright
Cause we on top we timeless in no time
Uh, hahaha

// There You Go //

I'm butter like Leopold
Look, I tell 'em to keep it low

Fuck, whoever be opposed
I'm in a deeper zone than on my last one
Run all of it backwards, you punt
I chose to go for it was in the corridor
Now I'm on choruses (uh)
I can never fold
I'm 'bout my coin like the laundry tho'
I get my paper then adios
Youngin' with bars like a audy home
Saba but well known like sabido
Sober but got off a addy doe
I tell the truth on like every song
I drop a classic that's Abbey Road
You can add 'em up
Two under my belt like I'm fat as fuck
You begging for help like you had enough
We really not into that acting tough
I'm really myself in this
I'm like a out west philanthropist
I write my songs with no cannabis
I'm in the bay bitch I'm tapping in
I coulda made what you made if I signed
I'm a independent young black men
I'm at yo head that's a CAT scan
Not here to kick it no Jack Chan
Random shoutout to my black fans
Listening to it and yelling out pivot
I'm partially studious, partially ignorant
I'm not here for the 15 minutes
All my team is winning, Imma need a minute

Yeah this nigga musta lost his fucking head, nigga

Half of my boys is on papers

You should return all your beats to who made 'em
Because that was not what they made for
I take my words and I wage war
I'm the best out I can assure
I can guarantee it, I just let it be it
I just say less while they say more
I stand my ground like on a fort
Winning because I am a sore-
Loser I maneuver like commuters
The water prolly bluer in the sewer
They want you to drink it like a brewer
You just blew ya chance like you were Bueller
And ya interest, perfect attendance
Was on the bus but now I'm on the tour

That's why usually I'm super low key I keep shit on the

How I'm posed to not like your pictures on every post girl you bad as fuck
And them stories got our inside jokes you know damn well that I'm swiping up

Outside just talking
Sitting in my ride we hotbox it
And I'm hypnotized by lil shawty
Cannot keep my eyes off her body

Lockdown what you in for
She told me to clear the
Acting innocent but

Said you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Oh girl you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
I said you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Oh girl you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Yeah

Tryna be a soldier
And keep my composure
But she got a cobra clutch on me
Every time we get closer
I can't focus
You know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Yeah

I was in West Oakland California when I found out about a piece of me
All this solitude around I'm starting to see when I'm alone the shit I think
I come from the part of town not talked about but chalk ya outline if you blink
I can't go outside today that shine'll fade and that go along with my piece
All these energies and entities and people that just want shit from me
I can't make this up the luxuries of being broke as fuck been escaping
Not to sound ungrateful bout the blessings but my best days are all in my past
I been working like a slave I'm proud to say now lil bitch I'm in my bag

And it ain't a ziplock
Went and got a wristwatch
Cop'll never respond
Anytime I risked my life
Clocking out it tic toc
Watch it all on tiktok
I'm willing to bet it all
I'm willing to risk my life

And it ain't a ziplock
Went and got a wristwatch
Cop'll never respond
Anytime I risked my life
Clocking out it tic toc
Watch it all on tiktok
I'm willing to bet it all
I'm willing to risk my life

I was in Bronx New York when I decided this the type of life that I'd live
I make sacrifices what the fuck you writing for you know you do not give
I got right back on my feet I fell face first the first time I'll admit I did
Took a couple years for me to feel like I did not fall upon all deaf ears
Niggas wanna wait but I call that fear
At least I got a place for if all else fails
Nigga I went on a date told her call that lyft
I told her lose my line and don't call back here
Yeah I'm bout to lose my mind I got all that care
They listen to me rhyme and can't hold back tears
Gamble on a life but it won't be fair
Trade it all for some sand and a beach chair

And it ain't a ziplock
Went a got a wristwatch
Cop'll never respond
Anytime I risked my life
Clocking out it tic toc
Watch it all on tiktok
I'm willing to bet it all
I'm willing to risk my life

And it ain't a ziplock
Went and got a wristwatch
Cop'll never respond
Anytime I risked my life
Clocking out it tic toc
Watch it all on tiktok
I'm willing to bet it all
I'm willing to risk my life
