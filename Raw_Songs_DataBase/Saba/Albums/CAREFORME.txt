// BUSY / SIRENS //

[BUSY]

[Saba:]
I'm so alone-but all of my friends
But all of my friends, got some shit to do, yeah
All 'em got plans, I call 'em; "My bad," and text 'em
They never cross me like bad pedestrians
I've been this awkward since adolescence
I don't know how long I had depression
Never no peer-pressure, I'm tryna' get my little pecker off in some girl
I call my B-F-F-that ain't no secret kept, I fucked then told my cousin
I'm broke, I wasn't buzzin', I tried to hit a few years, she wasn't budgin'
I'm bogus, left my girl for some shawty, surely deservin' of all this lonely
"You sad? Tell me, how are you sad?
You got all of these friends, you got all of these fans,"
I ain't trust nobody new since 2012, I ain't let nobody in
Jesus got killed for our sins, Walter got killed for a coat
I'm tryna' cope, but it's a part of me gone and apparently I'm alone

[theMIND & Saba:]
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh

[Saba:]
I'm so alone, just me and my girl
She leave me for work, then leave me for school, she finally home-I leave her for tour
FaceTiming nudity, yeah
All of this new to me, yeah
All of the infidelity when I was 17 been catchin' up, it still feel like she catch me cheatin'
Niggas askin' me how tour was
Knowin' I been home like two months
And I seen your ass like two times
Save the small-talk, like, too, damn
No time, social interaction
Have female friends I found attractive
I tried to fuck, but I am no savage
Now we don't speak, we just walk past
If my past could talk-it'd probably reply to the missed calls after all
'Cause the friendships that I can't recall, done turned my heart into camouflage
While the guys I used to play basketball with doin' shit that I can't endorse
Now, with the Lord; now, when it pours down; was alone then, still alone now

[theMIND & Saba:]
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh

[theMIND:]
I'm barely here, how I ain't present
Yeah, I drift for a second-forgot to reply to your message
But all these years
I been the same in your presence, countin' the seconds, before I reply to your message
My biggest fear (Is that I have to say goodbye)
Is that I have to say goodbye (another time) another time
So I skip town on our moment, hopefully prolonging this
I don't need nobody new to miss
I want you to know
Ooooh, ooh, ooh

[SIRENS]

[Saba:]
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels, ye

Ridin' through the city
I'm young, I'm black, I'm guilty
I know one time want to kill me
They don't know me but they fear me
Fifteen years old with the sticky
They gon' blame it on the marijuana
Hands behind your head
And they won't let up off the head
What if I move to this one state?
What if they shootin' that shit hit?
What if I run then it look bad?
Drawing they gun right off the hip
I'm probably deservin', 'cause I know they serve and protect
But they think I'm servin', or they think my cellphone's a weapon
Heard that the robber wore a black mask
I fit the description, a.k.a. nigga, what is the difference
Is it the name, we so divided I'm from Division
Clutch that purse 'cause of my dreadlocks
Cross that street 'cause I'm with my friends
Curse every song in Hip-Hop
Keep telling yourself it's a fad

Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels lay (yeah)
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the-

// BROKEN GIRLS //

I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, hey girl, girl, girl, girl
I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, hey girl

Really I'm broke myself, and I think she might help
Really I love a story, and I think she might tell
Really I'm not your crutch, really you not my girl
Really she usin' me, but it's cool, we use eachoth'
I'm in love with contemplatin' about the pressure
Conversations about depression
Confrontation 'cause we care too much about each other
We know it ain't permanent, but temporary
Releasin' your Issa Rae, insecure
Collect them like Pikachu, Venusaur
We go 'til you done or my penis sore
Sleepin' with the TV on, then we don't speak no more
And I know when I'm with you, or maybe when you're with me
Even if I don't feel a thing, for a second I feel complete
I still will keep ya in my back pocket
I know that I'm not shit, I know that it's toxic
I know that a part lives, that is where your heart is

I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, hey girl, girl, girl, girl
I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, hey, girl

Tread light like broken glass, really I'm not my past
Really I snatched your soul, really that's not to brag
Really when I'm alone, really I'm not to have
Really I know you're empty but I think I can fill your glass
Fantasizin' all your problems
I wanted you more since I found out you heartless
Harbourin' feelins' for niggas who hurt you
Know you on the surface but not on a personal level
I play the game of hearts, missin' piece, we ain't apart
Depend on me until I'm bored
I return your heart as quick I return your call
Tables turn quicker, 'cause after a weekend I miss ya
I don't want you, but I'm conflicted
I know that back and forth yo-yo shit over with
But you gon' take me back, I'm gon' convince ya
Pain ain't never looked so temptin'
Lonely never looked so distant, we just gon' ignore the tension
You know we both not shit, I know that shit toxic

I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, hey girl, girl, girl, girl
I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, hey, girl

This whole time been obsessed, being sad
She was my quick escape, made me forget
Hear her speak, see her weak, made me feel big
Crowned me, she downed me, treat me like shit
Second time, round two, what I learn?
She weren't mine, that weren't love, I weren't hers
I'm not hurt anymore, took some time
Found a girl, now I'm hers and she mine
And she made me feel whole, heal me
And it's mutual and we still in love

Can't you care for me?
Glad you care for me

// LIFE //

I got angels runnin' 'way, I got demons huntin' me
I know 'Pac was 25, I know Jesus 33
I tell Death to keep a distance, I think he obsessed with me
I say, "God, that's a woman," I know she would die for me
They want a barcode on my wrist
To auction off the kids that don't fit their description of a utopia (black)
Like a problem won't exist if I just don't exist
If I grew up without a single pot to piss in, pardon me for ventin'
Congress got the nerve to call itself religious
Rich just gettin' richer, we just tryna live our-

-life-Momma mixed the vodka with the Sprite
They killed my cousin with a pocket knife
While my uncle on the phone
He was gone for more than half my life
He got out a year and then he died
I was on the road
Talking to my father on the phone
Left the city when I was just four
None of them would get along
Momma beggin' him for winter clothes
I was chillin' with my nigga Spook
Now they tryna take his

Life don't mean shit to a nigga that ain't never had shit, yuh
Light don't mean lit in the dark, fight don't mean fists, ooh
Eyes don't see, eyes don't see, ice don't freeze
Light don't leave, I don't mean lie to me

Tell me I'll be okay, tell me happier days
Tell me that she my bae, that I won't be alone
Tell 'em I'll be okay, when he ask, "How's my day?"
Tell 'em that we the same, tell em' that we not safe

I got my grandaddy's soul, I'm at war, that's on my mind
I seen Walter body cold, wish I could switch it with mine
I'm not worried 'bout no rap shit, distractions or wasted times
I still go to social functions even though I'm so anti-
No, I'm no Rihanna, the court gonna throw it like Donovan, down a bit, I just been modelin'
My whole career as if 'Pac was here, studio monitors shakin', I raise the apartments
I'm bonded with profit, I made what I made, and allot it, amount of time that's in my mind the time you was watchin'
So stop comparing me to people, no, I am not them, a lot of people dream until they shit or get shit [*gunshot*] -

-that's life-Momma mixed the vodka with the Sprite
They killed my cousin with a pocket knife
While my uncle on the phone
He was gone for more than half my life
He got out a year and then he died
I was on a road
Talking to my father on the phone
Left the city when I was just four
None of them would get along
Momma beggin' him for winter clothes
I was chillin' with my nigga Spook
Now they tryna take his life

// CALLIGRAPHY //

I don't tell the truth so y'all will feel sorry for me
I don't write this shit so y'all will feel God comin'
I don't get down like that
Wrote this amount of raps
Just on a mission to find something
Calligraphy
Needed to feel, move to the beat of my drum
I don't mean kick and the snare
We cannot bear all of the fucked up shit that we been through
Why God keeping us here?
We be aware, but only timing will tell, when you will find all your letters
Calligraphy

Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy
Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy

I'm not mad at God, I just can't get out of bed
My best friend obituary really hang on my wall, by the dresser
I'm tryna see it, a life lesson
No more time for mournin' on my schedule
I see the right list
Calligraphy
Readin' the signs like I'm a highway driver
I just hit Blaise Blaise, hieroglyphic
I see the wall that they write in, I build a wall up in my head
Autopilot, what it felt like I was on
I sent the word out flyin'
Calligraphy

Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy
Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
I can't get out of it, I'm not mad at God
But I can't get out of it
Makes me runnin' away, runnin' away, runnin' away

// FIGHTER //

[Saba:]
Me and E-God just fought 'cause his family wouldn't stop talkin'
We neighbours who argued often
I run out joggin', one tossed a jab and I caught him
He threw a left, ain't connect 'cause I ducked when I came back up
I seen his sister talkin' trash like
"Touch my brother, I'm beatin' yo' ass"
So I fucked her brother up to see what she about, yeah
Walked away and then we noticed that his teeth was out, yeah
She ain't do shit, she just mad we got to see him pout
So me and Cell, we just fought
I was walkin' and then he jumped me
I dropped to the floor while calling for help
In front of my grandmother's house
The next hit, he punched me my mouth
I can't believe I'm on the ground
'Cause I tried to hit him, I gambled
I'm ugly, cryin' in public, I'm like
"When I get you back you gon' wish that you never touched me"
Somehow I never could touch him
Our brothers broke this shit up
And I walked the rest of the day with my head down
Funny how gettin' your ass beat'll spread 'round

[Kaina & Saba:]
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I war no more
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I war no more

[Saba:]
So me and E-God, we scrap again
Jacob jumped in, I'm handicapped
Manny watched from across the street
Then he ran up and hopped on me
Three on one, they teamin' up
But me, I never think to run
They circling around, got me surrounded like police or somethin'
So it's bad enough they already jumpin' me
Then I see Cell comin', I'm prayin', "Please don't fuck with me"
(Please leave me the fuck alone)
It's not fair and I think he agrees
So instead of fighting with them, he came and teamed up with me
Me and Grandpa ain't talked since I stopped attendin' the college
He called me, said I'm a scholar, I should be gettin' my doctorate
Or, shit, at least in the army, instead you chose to hip-hop
But I know how this is gon' end 'cause I went through this with yo' father
Me and my girl just fought 'cause I talked before she could talk
She was tellin' a story, I cut her off with some shit not 'bout
The same topic, so she just stopped in the middle before the plot
Hit the rest of the car ride silent, like "You always do this"
Like "You don't value my thoughts
Either that or you too damn stupid
To realize that if you don't hear me out then I'ma feel muted
You say that you care, well show it, I'm not askin' a lot
I know you think you listenin' but you just waitin' to talk"
My fault

[Kaina & Saba:]
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I war no more
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I war no more

[Saba:]
It's harder to love myself when all these people compliment me
Somehow it just remind me what I don't got
But these folks don't care to know
They think you rollin' in the dough
Not realizin' your next meal is a 4 for $4
Still feeling the guilt that Walt never thought to call
Fightin' myself to get out of bed
I'm fightin' myself to get out of bed
Fightin' myself

[Kaina & Saba:]
I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter

[Saba:]
Yeah, me and all my niggas dropped out
Then we drove to Texas, left at Walt's house
Kicked out of the hotel, we all broke
We don't got no mattress, sleep on yo' floor
Me and grandpa ain't spoke since I dropped out
Made sure on my first tour, stop at his house
I sleep on the hotel, not yo' floor
He tell me that he proud of his boy
I'm not a janitor no more at Homan Square
Saved up for a round trip, LAX
I just learned it's no risk, no reward
I slept on the floor at Port Author'
Me and all my niggas dropped tears
I been on the floor for a whole year
We all broke (we all broke), we all broke

// SMILE //

Sweet west side Chicago, two-flat apartment
Red brick and garden, that's been forgotten
Grass all splotchy, vacant lot splotchy, bank account splotchy
And we talk like we from the south
Our parents' parents from the south
And if I make a million dollars
I'll vacation in the south, and I'll

Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile

Warmer outside and safe ol' playground, grandma payroll cut, yeah
Cut up with my cousins, dream about when we grow up, yeah
Tube socks slippin' off our feet, our soles is hella black
When we die we go to heaven, know my granny taught me that
Oh, oh-oh, oh, I done lost a friend or two, they moved
Got in trouble for they fetchin', I ain't mean no Moulin Rouge
My bag got that two on two, our whole neighborhood unite
I put my fam' in a hotel when they couldn't pay the light
Life, I be takin' for granted, capture the moment, the Canon
My cousin be trappin', it came in the mail
I sat him down, asked his plan, he said, "This shit sell itself"
Grandma say, "What is that smell?"
We turn to Boomhauer like we on King of the Hill
Niggas talk that they gone keep it a hundred but I rather keep it a mil'
Everybody eat, I treat it like heat so that mean it's not a joke
I said I'ma keep it a mil', the rule, that mean a higher note
My grandma from Pinkhill and my granddaddy from Houston
And if I make a million dollars, then I'ma tell them we movin'

Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile

All that I am is my family mistakes
Moment of madness I can't seem to evade
More than a canvas, you carry me these days
Practice, I'm trying to remember, remember
All that I am is my family mistakes
Moment of madness I can't seem to evade
More than a canvas, you carry me these days
Practice, I'm trying to remember, remember

Sweet west side Chicago, two-flat apartment
Red brick and garden, that's been forgotten
Grass all splotchy, vacant lot splotchy, back account splotchy
And we talk like we from the south
Our parents' parents from the south
And if I make a million dollars
I'll vacation in the south, and I'll

Smile, smile, smile, smile

// LOGOUT //

[Saba:]
Right away, aye

If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post, but a reminder just how boring our lives ar-ar-ar-are
Look at how much fun I'm havin'
Ain't' no beauty in the absence, of broadcastin' to your followers
I see her, said let's get naked
I seen her sip-sippin' Henya'
I seen famous people all over
I don't want no autograph, I just want a follow back
Maybe tag to ya' followers

Playback, say that
That just the way that the game go
After the rain is a rainbow
I see a product you pay for, shit get forgotten a day ago
If I can not logon, and they started a rumor that I had got shot like a day ago
I don't wanna put down my headphones
I don't got cable in my crib
I don't even know how we got here
Being independent is my fear
Government look like the mafia, censorin' out what you watchin'
Internet turned me into another man
Solitaire more than game with your card
Can't change the channel, it'll stay in our heart
Stay in the public and pray to your God
Need validation, I'm too insecure
Carry those duffs from 140, 280, you posted your story
I'm from the 2-90, two sides to each story
Yeah I'll be your friend, but you can not follow me

Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think they got ev-Ooh
Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think I got every-Look

[Chance The Rapper:]
Everything's on camera, everything's on camera
Everybody want handouts, everybody got pamphlets
Everybody want Santa, everything is on camera
Everybody want pics now, everybody got antlers
Everybody my kid now, everybody got pampers
Everything is on me now, everybody got cameras
Ain't nobody got Chancellor, ain't nobody got answers
All them scratchin' they head now, ain't nobody got dandruff
Don't nobody likes selfies on they own page
I know people with they friend request as their homepage
Ain't put a picture on they wall since the Stone Age
Feel locked up in they own cage, when they on stage

// GREY //

The best song is probably on the B-Side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
This so grey-grey
The best song is probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine-grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest in the game-grey

Sometimes I think about the pressures of a artist
And what it takes to be called a
Success, even with no college we barely even considered
Don't label me with them niggas
Infatuation with plastic, I wanted it to be realer
First they wanted the hip-hop
Then they wanted guerilla and then they wanted drug dealer
And then they wanted a dancer
Now they want a drug addict, infatuation with plastic
White girl want to be sister
Driver want to be walker and walker want to be sitter

The best song is probably on the B-Side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
This so grey-grey
The best song is probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine-grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest in the game-grey

Sometimes I think about the pressures of the label
And what it take to get paid for discoverin' art, they ain't no
Existin', I know it ain't yo, intention to try and change me
Multi-million, your children, private school, they attendin'
And album sellin' what did it, I shuck and jive, a good nigga
Split the pot and I'm silent
I'ma give you your single and you just give me the finance
"Saba, if it's so bad then, hey why the hell are they signin'?"
'Cause sitter want to be walker and walker want to be drivin'

The best song is probably on the B-Side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
This so grey-grey
The best song is probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine-grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest in the game-grey

Care for me, carefully, back with more clarity
Back like consecutive, I told you motherfuckers like Oedipus
Heather B, Sway in the Morning, painter that paint like a portrait
Action, I aim for the target, aim for the fame but the fortune cool
Alterin' the altitude, offerin' the thought for food
Offerin' that art that move, hmm
Carefully editing every word, everything got to be charity
Give it my all, these melodies therapy
I keep it thoroughly PIVOT the legacy
How could you not be moved? I don't give them an option to
Don't nobody want to be great, everybody want to be seen
And nobody want to be quiet, everything is
Everything is, everything is, everything is
Care for me, carefully, back with more clarity
Back like consecutive, I told you m- look
Everything is grey, everything is grey
Everything is grey, everything

// PROM / KING //

[PROM]

[Saba:]
This remind me of before we had insomnia
Sleepin' peacefully, never needed a pile of drugs
Everybody was college-bound, no dollar amounts
In God we trust, senior year my prom ain't had no party bus
My cousin hit me on Facebook, like "What shorty you takin'?"
I'm lyin', I'm playin', I'm sayin', "I got one to take," and I'm waitin' on her response
Wrote her a 3 page letter, it's 3 days later, never hit me back, she broke my heart
So now he I'm'ing me shit like, "Yo' is shorty bad?"
I pretend not to be depressed, she never wrote me back
I hit him back like "Yo', well fuck her, it's on to the next"
I wrote that message thinkin' I'm awkward, prolly' would never have sex
You know in high school, 16 you prolly late
My cousin hit me back, "Don't trip, bro. I got you a date."
So he sent me this link to some girl I had never seen
He said to call and tell her "Walter sent you, you with me."
I think about it for a minute, like what's his intentions?
I mean, we never really got along or used to kick it
In fact, if I remember vividly, he picked on me
He used to beat me up and take my sneakers every family visit
I'm skeptical to let her know I'm Walter little cousin
What if this shit all a joke, then again, what if it wasn't?
Would I really risk the chance of me potentially fuckin'
On some stranger daughter 'cause I barely know if I can trust him?
Prolly not
I finally called her, tell her Walter sent me, "My name Tahj"
She asked me what's the color scheme that we gon' wear to prom
I'm actin' like I'm not excited, tryna play it off
"So what's the car we're takin'?" "Worst come worst, my mom can take us"
I'll call Walter, thank him, he said don't trip and just wear black
He said she cool and they go back, if any problems, send him back
I never had to, but now we're in tune
He Facebook messaged me like, "Sorry not to be a nuisance..."
But he like 30 dollars short on all his prom suit shit
I'm like, "I got you, cause. That's the least that I can do."
He tell me send him the addy and he'll slide after school
I'm like, "Ok, bet," never knew where he stayed at
He walked down the street, hella surprised, "This where y'all place at?"
Uncle Carl, Auntie Deborah, my cousin Rena
And I'm surprised too, my family knew, kept this a secret
Me and cause stay down the street, living different lives
Everyday he on the bus, me, I get a ride
I gave him 30 on the porch, he never went inside
He tell me, "Thank you," then he walked back home with a smile
He tryna hide it, but I see his dimple
I'm thinkin', "Damn, that transaction was simple"
I'm talking shit, I know he hoop, I'm like, "Aye, where the rim, bro?"
He like, "Tomorrow, if you free, you prolly weak as shit, tho."
I know my brother not
So all 3 of us went to the park and ran some niggas off the court
I'm hella passive, I was passin', I ain't have to score
The next day the prom, I couldn't sleep, I stayed up
My granddad gave me a condom then walked away, didn't say nothin'
She hopped out of her car and said that her name was Jada
My heart's racin', I'm focused, I'm tryna keep it playa
Gave her the croissant, or corsage or whatever the fuck my mom handed me
And said, "Now put it on her hand, Malik", family ties
My grandfather taught me how to tie up a tie 'cause my dad lived in NY
That's prolly why I was shy, so self-conscious
Took pictures on the porch, and then we headed for the prom and
Walter went on prom the same day, but to a different place
So he text me like, "Cause, this the spot. Let's meet up later
And bring Jada through," prom flashed, I kept it cool
We show up to the function where she brought a change of clothes
I'm lookin' around like, "Damn, I don't know nobody"
We at this party out West and Jada left to get dressed
I'm fakin' like I'm sendin' text
Some stranger get really close, I swear that I hear his breath
Then he put a knife to my neck
Gave me the run down like, "Jada my sister
And if you hit her, fuck her, make her miss ya, I'ma kill ya!"
At this point, I'm just exhausted
Wonderin' where the fuck's Walter
He shows up like 30 minutes after our altercation
I never mentioned it to him, he kinda overprotective
And I know if I tell him, that he'll beat this nigga's skull in
Turn his body a skeleton, and our night'll end terrible
I exhale and say, "Fuck it", and I just chose to let it go

[KING]

(Said you're used to getting everything your way... this not how that happens this time, just gotta fuck with your boy?)

Walt went to St. Louis, had a full ride for his hoopin'
Him and his coach got into it, now he back home doin' music, aye
I was at Columbia, a damn near straight A student
I had one B in a hip-hop class, I thought that shit was stupid
He transferred to Robert Morris, always living down the street
My class let out at 2: 40 and his class let out at 3
Mama asked me where the hell I been and where the hell I be
"I'm with Walter, mom, I'm safe" I keep walkin' in here late
I might fall off in your bae, I get girls now, I get laid
I get caught up followin' Walter, I'm a product of my age
He talk to erry' girl in downtown Chicago
Wingman, I cannot fly though
He was in Cal with Impala, he was that nigga in the party
Awfully popular for someone that they barely mention
Plus we from the part of city that they barely mention
Just logged into Twitter and somehow we was barely mentioned
We signed our names on the open mic list and then they skipped us
And then they skipped us again like a week later
Like, obviously this fuckin' host can't read the paper
Hella' intimidatin', the big guy didn't have to flex
So Walter walked to the host and said, "This the name you callin' next"
Bullied our way to the stage and then overstayed our welcome
An apple never get too far from the tree that it fell from
Just like my father tryna do music and hope I make it
Walter joined me for the journey said the city waitin'
PIVOT

Walter invincible, dodged death like a mad magician
More times than a mathematician
I'm in LA workin' on Bucket List Project, I get a call and get a fishy feeling
Normally Walt joke on the phone, this time he over serious
My heart droppin', I'm like, "Yo, what is it?!"
He say he with T.Y on the highway and some niggas just tried to kill him
Emptied the clip on the car, but somehow they didn't hit him
Sometimes I fuckin' hate Chicago, 'cause I hate this feelin'
Innocent niggas get shot at, in the broad day, the A.M
I asked him for a play-by-play of how their whole day went
He said he went to XSport, and they ran a full court
And I can not retort without thinkin' that this can't be the reason
"So what else you do? What about Ty? Is he still cool?
Where you on your way from, and where you on your way to?"
He say he just left for dinner at a friend crib, and that's it
He say "Ty don't do shit but smoke, honestly Saba, that's it"
Give him sympathy, another case of mistaken identity
The news prolly' gon' run this, as two gangs from different streets
Police questionin' him like he just shot at a trooper
My boy walked away unharmed, and we did Lollapalooza, yeah
6 months pass by, everyday we celebrate, everyday a better day
I just dropped Bucket List, Walter 'bout to drop a tape
Everything goin' perfect, couldn't paint a better way
PIVOT gang is on the way, we just sold out Lincoln Hall
Then I went to talk to Sway
I got back home and got back on it, 'cause Walter was doin' tour dates
Sendin' me links to songs that he made, Kid Cudi, we are not ridin' no waves, aye
Grandma made us blanket plates, we played 2K, that's just a day before
Fatimah got a show tomorrow, he text me, "Aye, we in that hoe"
I went to the barbershop, the first thing the next mornin'
Then I got up with Legit, we supposed to do some recordin'
10 minutes into this session, I got a call from a number
That I don't got saved, but I answer anyways
She says, "Hello, Malik, have you or Squeak
Talked to my son today? He was just on the train."
We got in the car, but we didn't know where to drive to
Fuck it, wherever you are my nigga, we'll come and find you...

[John Walt:]
Just another day in the ghetto
Oh, the streets bring sorrow
Can't get out today with their schedule
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow

// HEAVEN ALL AROUND ME //

Yellin' at my mother like, "I know you hear me"
Get a little closer, repeat, bus driver pass me up, don't see me
Paramedics talk about what he need, he need his oxygen
They seem incompetent, I see the consequence
I walk when I can't hear them, they're inaudible
I got a light I gotta go, forensics search for follicle
I promise y'all I'm not a ghost, I promise y'all

Look, there's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around
No, I can't feel pain but I can see the stars
I ain't leave in vain but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around
No, I can't feel pain but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven

Yellin' at my brothers like, "I know that I'm here"
Regardless how loud, they don't hear
Walkin' through the crowd, they share tears
I know I did not disappear
Uphill I'm battlin', I see the cameraman
I see the new station's truck parked outside, it's every channel here
Yeah, interview, interview, interview, cut
Someone just bled out because they got (What?!)
Chalk outline look like the shape of my shadow
Can go right through the wall if I try touch

There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven, heaven, heaven
No, I can't feel pain but I can see the stars
I ain't leave in vain but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around
No, I can't feel pain but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me
There's heaven

Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
