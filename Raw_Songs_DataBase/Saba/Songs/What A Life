Ayy, shit's creek was deep, was with my peeps, we kept on paddlin'
Though was all on baby, know it's snakes who brought them rattles in
Fuck you heard? The cattle been lookin' like lunch, big crunch
Make you feel it in your core like the abdomen, I'm adamant
Yeah, kinda bent
Movement Uber extra, hope it got some tint
Nonchalant, not usually with the extra, just an excellent
Not the quick, this that long-haul like a corridor
Explore it more, got some keys that y'all adore
I too worked through sorrow and still had to borrow more
I might go tomorrow, you finish, I start it for us
True feelings show, villains grow, I Mighty Morph
Got too many loads, how it goes, I need more


Oh, they lie, but I keeps it honest (Gotta keep it all the way)
Oh, they try and I gets it done (Gotta get this done, okay)
Don't know why I keeps it going and keep somethin' on the way
Oh, what a life, what a life (Yeah, ayy)


Yesterday I was just in France
The day before that, we was scrambling just trying to get meals
Treating fast food like a five star
Check arrive and all of us split the bill
Some niggas cracking the card
I don't mean card in the crack like "Tip Drill"
Free all my dawgs from the pack
Some of 'em caught in the act gotta sit still
Gwen Stefani, might tell 'em to holla' back
I heard life a bitch, but nah, I do not call her that
Trucker with the fit, my nigga, the starter pack
I heard when I spit that a nigga might get a chill, I brought it back
I tip my hat to the ones who were all forgotten
That got on they grind until they grew and didn't grow rotten
You sprout from the mud, that's what you do when you don't have options
When all of 'em duck and dodgin' truth, you would keep it honest, honest


Oh, they lie, but I keeps it honest (Gotta keep it all the way)
Oh, they try and I gets it done (Gotta get this done, okay)
Don't know why I keeps it going and keep somethin' on the way
Oh, what a life, what a life (Oh, what a life, what a life)
Oh, they lie, but I keeps it honest (Gotta keep it all the way)
Oh, they try and I gets it done (Gotta get this done, okay)
Don't know why I keeps it going and keep somethin' on the way
Oh, what a life, what a life (Oh, what a life, what a life)
