Been thinking maybe I ain't the player I thought I was
For the right face I'm a lightweight gotta get my tolerance up

I be tryna catch myself right before I fall
No luck
That's why usually I'm super low key I keep shit on the
Hush
But I'm asking love
How I'm posed to not like your pictures on every post girl you bad as fuck
And them stories got our inside jokes you know damn well that I'm swiping up
She tryna blow my mind or some

Outside just talking
Sitting in my ride we hotbox it
And I'm hypnotized by lil shawty
Cannot keep my eyes off her body
I ain't t worried bout time when you round me
When you hit my line the world stops
She been on my mind on my conscious
Even with my guard up you got me
And I fuck wit her vibe cause it's
Positive
Obvious
I fall when you got all of it

I said
You know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Oh girl you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
I said you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Oh girl you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Yeah

Tryna be a soldier
And keep my composure
But she got a cobra clutch on me

Every time we get closer
I can't focus
You know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Yeah

I think she knows what she doing
Untied that shit like a loose end
Follow command yeah like a lieutenant
I said no to them but you can
Get me to change my mind your two cents
I'm bout ready to offer you to move in
I had to take my plans and move them
Now the homie like aye bruh who's your new friend

Who said
You can
Look this good I got shit to do
I'm bout
To spend
Too much
On shit I could give to you

Missed another appointment
She said miss me with lil boy shit
Before the game start like a coin flip
Can't play both sides like a coy fish

And she not worried bout no old bitch
I think I'm addicted like the shit opium
She a movie star I'm bout to get it on film
She do everything that she intends

I atten-hut
Lockdown what you in for
She told me to clear the
Acting innocent but

Said you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Oh girl you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
I said you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Oh girl you know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Yeah

Tryna be a soldier
And keep my composure
But she got a cobra clutch on me
Every time we get closer
I can't focus
You know just what you doing
You know just what you doing
Yeah
