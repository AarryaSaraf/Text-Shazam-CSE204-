Been in a daze since the ink hit the seam now
I think it's time for me to play
My runnin' days read the moment of me now
I won't stop until I find a way home
The summer's gaze gives me a tingling ease now
Anticipate a veil of shade
But the shade is a gift from the tree now
I won't stop until I see the change I have made


Damn, it's been a while since nights we saw you
Under the viaduct, if it's fire, run, run
To everybody that look like us
Who fam don't talk when they tired
There's more than what meets your eyelids
And live in the park just dyin' make you forget what you fight about
Plus what good is that flight? You ain't flyin' out your entire house
From Camry cars to the fancy, all without any dark kids in the train car
Hustlin' candy bars to play basketball
I still get nostalgic seein' houses that my family lost
They wished upon a star, I caught it like I'm Randy Moss
When granny fought for her property, she would turn down any cost
I'm the grandson of Carl who lived across from the fosters
Then fostered me to spread love through holiday poverty
Hand-me-downs I was given, I thought they were bought for me
A tale of two Chicagos, this gets confused commonly
'Cause one, you're commemorated if you're the hot commodity
I tried that invincible shit, but the principle is
When there's niggas defendin' your wig, then it's a pendulum shift
I tried to spend a lil' less like a minimalist
But then I can confess that this gets harder the bigger you get
