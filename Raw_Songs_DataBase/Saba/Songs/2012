Yeah

Two students that had each other back in the world against 'em
Who barely showed up to class once they had each other's attention
I'm down to spend every minute that I can to her limit
'Cause usually she down to kick it until she get tired of niggas
Music's our common interest, we're ramblin' about Kendrick and Kid Cudi
I'm tryna put her onto shit that she missin'
But she had everything, I mean everything I was listing
So I even gave her my tapes in hope she would try to listen
The kind of bond where it get hard not to fall in your feelings
But she talkin' 'bout friendship (What?)
A similar commute, we on the same side of town
And her school close to my campus
So when I get off the bus, it's fuck it, I'm 'bout to go down there
I've always struggled to converse if it wasn't a verse
Social anxiety, it got me stumblin' on words
But I always speak my mind and shit when I'm with her (Yeah)

Yeah, uh, corner store to the Porsche with my new thing
Yeah, my new thing, yeah, uh, yeah
We'll get lost in the world like we're wanted
Hey, you know me, ayy, yeah
Uh, corner store, can't afford shit but your chips
Hey, the choices, hey, uh, uh
We don't gotta mature, we're just young kids
Ayy, so fuck them

I had everything I needed, everything
Yeah, I had everything I needed, everything

Yeah, my niggas that had each other back in the world against 'em
From a poverty stricken parable that our hearts had written
We come from fifty-cent bags of candy and penny pitchin'
It's like a wishin' well if we gave the concrete our wishes
We dreamt so loudly, we would wear it when the sun would slow up
On the grayest day we on the train in our colorful clothin'
A child-like innocence, we cherished it and tried to hold it
We was either askin' 'bout performances or where the hoes was
My granny basement became the Mecca like Eric Foreman's
The cushion in my uncle couch fell out, but we still on it
Shit, if you ever need a place to stay you can sleepover
If not, it's back to CTA, I'll catch y'all in the mornin'
The green line's dangerous, for us it's just how we get home
I wanted dreads, I put the brush down and I grabbed a comb
I can take you where it's rough, I mean the catacomb
All these bodies droppin' same blocks that we played tag
For some old shit, they wanted they payback
So we escape it all in the booth with the playback
'Cause this the only place that we knew you were safe at

Yeah, uh, corner store to the Porsche with my new thing
Yeah, my new thing, yeah, uh, yeah
We'll get lost in the world like we're wanted
Hey, you know me, ayy, yeah
Uh, corner store, can't afford shit but your chips
Hey, the choices, hey, uh, uh
We don't gotta mature, we're just young kids
Ayy, so fuck them

I had everything I needed, everything
Yeah, I had everything I needed, everything
Said I had everything I needed, everything
'Cause I had everyone I needed
