Black astronaut, forecast report
How they actually thought that you wouldn't find your way
That matters not, it's an act of God
Can I tag along, now that you're in outer space? (Outer space)
Now that you're in outer space

Ayy, can I please breathe, three feet, no pressure
Ayy, soon I'll hit stratosphere and that'll lower the pressure
We diggin' for a happy that is deeper than depressions
From eagles in the deserts, assaults with a deadly weapon
But we leave it all behind with our other worldly possessions
No rocket ship to rally behind, so we reinvested
My time spent in buying shit that doesn't even mesh with me
I'm see through, but insecurities need they confessions

Like abra-cadabra, we made all of our doubt disappear
We used to be invisible, that was a different year
It appeared different peers tried to kill me with ideas
That whatever I would do was far from cool or fittin' in
Loneliness struck with a slight chance of rain
Black astronaut, they don't like you in space
Bright blue the day, find my terrain
Dare I to say, I'm on my way
