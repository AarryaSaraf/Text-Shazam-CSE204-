Okay the money on the way it'll lay by the first
Adolescence I would curse on the way to the church
My career just turned to cursive how I connect the words
Ain't grow up with much of shit but still it coulda been worse
He ain't focused on her pants he want get in her purse
I need it all in advance if they book me to work
From we barely had a chance left the crib on alert
To a crib with alarms and security perks
Insecurity hurts the same way jewelry works
So if you paying to flex, pay your security first
No point in paying for whips to ride a funeral hearse
We be prepared for the best but also fearing the worst

Okay every nigga that I know is scared of going broke
I know if I fall back down ain't no one there to lend me rope
Okay and every nigga that I know takes care of so and so
So ain't no option option option
You best go make more

Cause fearmonger live amongst us
I feel hunger hunger but guess
I feel something at least
I need something to eat

When fearmonger live amongst us
I feel hunger hunger but guess
I feel something at least
I need something to eat

And scared money never made money what I was taught
But once you make money you'll be more afraid than us all
My grandfather drove a corvette convertible car
He passed away and left his will to the fate of the stars
I made a cool mmmmm all for saying a bar
I was scared to spend a dime like what if I die tomorrow
Would my fam intervene for a bag of the g's
In a black model 3 sheesh passenger seat
Would my fans leave if I can't put asses in seats
If I log out an app or I lack a retweet
I'm just scared to go back didn't have shit to eat
Half my bread go to taxes the actual thieves

Okay every nigga that I know is scared of going broke
I know if I fall back down ain't no one there to lend me rope
Okay and every nigga that I know takes care of so and so
So ain't no option option option
You best go make more

Cause fearmonger live amongst us
I feel hunger hunger but guess
I feel something at least
I need something to eat

When fearmonger live amongst us
I feel hunger hunger but guess
I feel something at least
I need something to eat

I'm dropping pounds
I hear my stomach growl

I'm dropping pounds
I hear my stomach growl

I'm dropping pounds
I hear my stomach growl

Yes fearmonger lurk among us
I done clawed my way up
But that bottoms callin me down
Slip and I'll drown
