I was in West Oakland California when I found out about a piece of me
All this solitude around I'm starting to see when I'm alone the shit I think
I come from the part of town not talked about but chalk ya outline if you blink
I can't go outside today that shine'll fade and that go along with my piece
All these energies and entities and people that just want shit from me
I can't make this up the luxuries of being broke as fuck been escaping
Not to sound ungrateful bout the blessings but my best days are all in my past
I been working like a slave I'm proud to say now lil bitch I'm in my bag

And it ain't a ziplock
Went and got a wristwatch
Cop'll never respond
Anytime I risked my life
Clocking out it tic toc
Watch it all on tiktok
I'm willing to bet it all
I'm willing to risk my life

And it ain't a ziplock
Went and got a wristwatch
Cop'll never respond
Anytime I risked my life
Clocking out it tic toc
Watch it all on tiktok
I'm willing to bet it all
I'm willing to risk my life

I was in Bronx New York when I decided this the type of life that I'd live
I make sacrifices what the fuck you writing for you know you do not give
I got right back on my feet I fell face first the first time I'll admit I did
Took a couple years for me to feel like I did not fall upon all deaf ears
Niggas wanna wait but I call that fear
At least I got a place for if all else fails
Nigga I went on a date told her call that lyft
I told her lose my line and don't call back here
Yeah I'm bout to lose my mind I got all that care
They listen to me rhyme and can't hold back tears
Gamble on a life but it won't be fair
Trade it all for some sand and a beach chair

And it ain't a ziplock
Went a got a wristwatch
Cop'll never respond
Anytime I risked my life
Clocking out it tic toc
Watch it all on tiktok
I'm willing to bet it all
I'm willing to risk my life

And it ain't a ziplock
Went and got a wristwatch
Cop'll never respond
Anytime I risked my life
Clocking out it tic toc
Watch it all on tiktok
I'm willing to bet it all
I'm willing to risk my life
