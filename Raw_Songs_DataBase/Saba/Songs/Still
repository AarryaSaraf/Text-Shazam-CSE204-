Still missin' my lady, still smokin' like crazy
Still can't believe this is all real
Still spendin' per diem
Still lovin' these hoes, I still don't really need them
I'm still, our life is like a film, set in a different realm
I'm still tryna decide how I feel
I'm still rough as a rider, I'm still right here beside you
I'm still tryna find a beat to-


She say "I gotta be still, yeah, I gotta be still"
Bare a cross right 'cause when life goin' right then they might wanna re-deal
I say "I wanna be here", but I got moves to make
There's so many people workin' for me nowadays
That I don't even know who I pay, okay
I'm still right here beside you, gettin' sick of the costume
What's the real world?
When you with me, you take off your cool
Admittedly, yeah, I do too
I know I'm more illusive, but her grip never get looser
And that's why I don't wan' lose her
Ridin' 'round two-ninety, windows down
I get reminded to slow down
I get a message, we up now
She without 
I try to be profound, but you would get lost for me
I had to leave and put it on hold until you across for me again


Still missin' my lady, still smokin' like crazy
Still can't believe this is all real
Still spendin' per diem
Still lovin' these hoes, I still don't really need them
I'm still, our life is like a film, set in a different realm
I'm still tryna decide how I feel
I'm still rough as a rider, I'm still right here beside you
I'm still tryna find a beat to kill


High (High-high-high), high (High)
High (Just as still)
High (High-high-high), high (High)
High (Just as still)
High (High-high-high), high (High)
High
Uh-uh-uh, mm-mm

I hope you still got, hope you still got
And you still got my hoodie
Still have my car, still have my wallet
Still in that pocket, hope you don't call it
Pullin' my card, still where your momma live
Right off Parker road it's-
Still be callin' to me, she love me still
Got a bond still, so what's fuckin' real?
Discussion still, if there's somethin' still
Love a women still, got my gun inside of the function
Still-I am Shakespeare, no eraser, I wrote this verse in stone
Sculped the horoscope, I'm morse code, still tapped in with your hoe (With your hoe)
Smino touch the soul (Soul)
I change actually when I'm in the booth
I eat it like baba ghanoush
Right by the lanes and right by the goose
I'm really just still into you


Still missin' my lady, still smokin' like crazy
Still can't believe this is all real
Still spendin' per diem
Still lovin' these hoes, I still don't really need them
I'm still, our life is like a film, set in a different realm
I'm still tryna decide how I feel
I'm still rough as a rider, I'm still right here beside you
I'm still tryna find a beat to kill


My mother's house, the glue that kept the family together
There's nothin' like y'all
People moved out of the city and the compact got vacated
We were always loved more than...
Half an hour from the house
