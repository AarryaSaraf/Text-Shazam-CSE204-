Is this caution a cause?
It's justified in my eyes, sometimes I got God
But other times, other times, we feel like
We wanna let our guards down
That's not how to survive
Never ending cycle of life
Most times, we on guard


Life is fighting while nobody notices
Die a man or live out like the soldiers
Life is filled with answers that make no sense
Live a man or die out like the soldiers

I hope the world learn a value, the life of my unborn, yeah
'Cause what I'ma tell them when the time get here
I'm dyin' from asphyxiation from the weight of the world
While in the waitin' room, waitin' for the birth of my girl
How I'ma be a troop tryna lead a troop of my own?
You know what they do to a home?
That's why I bought this here chrome
Don't need an automatic, not Paula Patton
But two guns, yeah, I thought about it
We caught a cab and like a rally
We drove it through the rain while my girl is in pain
It's not impossible to think that we just made a mistake
'Cause to play the part of father is a sacred art to toddlers
City made a mark upon us, I'ma say that I'm a father
All I can do is pray that they don't make me an example
'Cause safety is something that is not here like a bantu
It's like I'm drafted and I gotta leave the family
I'm just hopin' I return with all my body parts attached to me
Yeah, exactly

Life is fighting while nobody notices
Die a man or live out like the soldiers
Life is filled with answers that make no sense
Live a man or die out like the s-
(Live as a man, we die out a soldier)


I know I'm poor, but I don't wanna go to war
The whole mission, I'll just miss mi amor
In trenches amongst henchmen and gore
Callin' for the Lord like a slave with a sword
Watchin' my back like my ass gettin' fat
Told recruiters right before they shoot us
That I can't differentiate between blue and black
So I conduct a draft and remain intact
In camouflage, I'll still be a snack
Be a star in the desert, like the Bible
Like beautiful girls that have dudes suicidal
They can't shoot me, they tryna shoot they shot
Fuck a bullet and a rifle, and it's too hot
Just imagine when the gun let
Off in the crossfire, more than one death
Scope on my curves like I'm in a sundress
Drones follow me around after sunset
I'm gettin' hunted


Life is fighting while nobody notices
Die a man or live out like the soldiers
Life is filled with answers that make no sense
Live a man or die out like the soldiers


Forgive me, I only meant well
Still fighting every day with myself
Through the land of the fallen while you wait
Awake by the morning, someone prayed
I was told to soak it all in like sun rays
But the sun's like a grenade


If all of this can go bad
Then what's the point of tryin'? (Ooh)
Go bad
Then what's the point of it?
If all of this can go-
