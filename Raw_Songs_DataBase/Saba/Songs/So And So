Fl-Fl-Flex Lennon

Propose a toast, you know
Made the most with all your highs and lows
Stick to the code, you know, the same as before
Gang La Costra Nostra
I don't know so and so, who may assume
Staying at home, I'm lowkey
We can all rise or fall, this ain't before
The fame is taking over

I don't know so and so, I don't assume you do
Hop out a Volvo, that bitch go vroom vroom
I'm with my dogs, dogs, they'll go woof, woof
You niggas all bark, bark, but they all poodles
Anything for dough, your bro sold his soul
Back up in effect, she told me that I am up next
Might get me tatted on her neck, it ain't no cattle for the set
You wanna battle, then how much you wanna bet?
Put a hundred thousand on it, yeah, yeah
Got the plate with salmon on it, yeah, yeah
Every day a ceremony, yeah, yeah
I feel like Tim in San Antoni-o
I flip the flow the flow, the same as before
At least a plus four, gang, you know
I never went alone to no nigga show
I don't be on the phone, you ain't my bro
Better come correct with the quote, mm
I ain't made a mill', but I'm close, mm
That's why I need the digit for the show, mm
We ain't talking, I ain't social

Propose a toast, you know
Made the most with all your highs and lows
Stick to the code, you know, the same as before
Gang La Costra Nostra
I don't know so and so, who may assume
Staying at home, I'm lowkey
We can all rise or fall, this ain't before
The fame is taking over
