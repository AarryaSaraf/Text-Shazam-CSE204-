Personal opinion don't amount to what our God say
Tell the kids go farther when they house don't have a padre
Bottle water when I rap
Grew up never drinking from the tap
I was so sick of these airports till covid hit the map
Now we're too sleep at this point
We even tired of taking naps
I lost close friends to a drug binge in hopes I can bring em back
Momma said this the revelation
Doubters all looking for resolutions
Everyone buying in desperation
On a good note there's no air pollution
Mane our reflection is over the seven seas
It's clear that we want it all eyes on we watchu see
