Woke up today, said, "I'm gettin' it right" (Yeah)
Been up some days and I been up some nights (Some nights, some days)
I got the plan and I didn't look twice
All for the simplest life (Simple life)

Doot-doot, doot-doot
Doot, doot
Doot-doot, doot-doot
Doot, doot

She say the little things matter, they show her she needed
If you can provide 'em, then she won't be leavin'
The man of my family, can't be no teachers
You learn what you see, and no, we didn't see it
Money can't be the security for her
But it's important even if you poor
White picket fence and a wreath on the door
We from the basement, concretes on the floor
Concrete on the deck
With a rim, I'm callin' check
In the simple autumn weather, give my daughter all that's left
When her father laid to rest
The money never made me, I'm more than I invest
In the mornin', I'm a mess
But wakin' up next to (You)
Makes it worth it (Yeah)

Been up some days and I been up some nights (Some nights, some days)

All for the simplest life (Simple life)
I put the pain in this shit, did it right

Hop off the train at the end of the light
That was a simpler time (Simple time)


Doot-doot, doot-doot
Doot, doot
Doot-doot, doot-doot

Thank the sky for slowin' time, shit got too complicated
Pace myself, the paper swells, I'm patient, not complacent
Calm like the sea when it meets the horizon, no
No one can, no one can shake me, not even Poseidon, no
Live long and sing my song, so Black and free
That's all I really want this life to be
Green trees blossom 'round my seeds
With green stashed with the lock and key (Yeah)
Wouldn't that be perfect?
If the world ran on fulfilled purpose
And all persons worked like they purchases
Fillin' purses of wealthy serpents
Kneel down and look up, fillin' up the place of worship
Prayin' for days that hurt less
Karma come break the curses
Maybe that's what my worth is
Paint a new picture perfect
