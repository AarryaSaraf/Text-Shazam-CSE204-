Don't stop

She say the shit don't stop
Tears don't stop
At home scared so the fear don't stop
Speaking of the crib
Nigga rent don't stop
Don't stop

And the fear don't stop
The kids don't stop
That's why she overdrive swear sis don't stop
Cause the rich don't stop
Yeah don't stop

Okay
Text don't call
Fail don't fall
Yeah the grind one of a kind like a damn snowball
I put gang in my name like I am Mozart
And if they saying you a stain no they ain't gone wash
Wash my soul
Watch my bro
We were both struggling
How he cope
He need dope
Give me no substances
I get on
He get caught now he gone for a minute
I ghetto my household was the oldest one here
It ain't no fear up in my eyes
They was tryna catch me like fireflies
Whether westside or the southside
They'll televise I'm top 5
Dead or alive like Killa Cam in a pink mink
What I tell the guys
I metamorph
Fuck around might teleport
I tell the sky
Racking the list we were stacking the grip
To give back to the crib
Like Colin Kaepernick on a knee
In the midst of being from where you have to get rich
Whether passing assist or grabbing a
Sack and a stick to attack were you live

She said the shit don't stop
Tears don't stop
At home scared so the fear don't stop
Speaking of the crib
Nigga rent don't stop
Don't stop

And the fear don't stop
The kids don't stop
That's why she overdrive swear sis don't stop
Cause the rich don't stop
Yeah don't stop

Don't stop
Microphone hot
I forgive my enemies because they know not
White collar job that's like a bowtie
Meanwhile we just let the whole week go by
Thinking bout the past that I've grown from
Focused on the bag bat that's a homerun
Falling from the cliff with nothing to hold on
I'm just like you look how I put my clothes on
Yeah a lot of niggas quit just cause the road long
A lot of people fear what really goes on
A lot will follow doubt I think they chose wrong
You're only talking loud just cause you're unsure
I said the grind don't stop till my vitals stop
I was 18 but I know my mind was a lot
More ready for the world, worldwide won't stop
Got too much to keep it moving for I won't stop

She said the shit don't stop
Tears don't stop
At home scared so the fear don't stop
Speaking of the crib
Nigga rent don't stop
Don't stop

And the fear don't stop
The kids don't stop
That's why she overdrive swear sis don't stop
Cause the rich don't stop
Yeah don't stop
