Yeah
Way I see it I'm top 10
I never let a motherfucker try me nah
I'm feeling the pressures I'm like a diamond y'all
My family straight I'm getting what I need all
10, 000 hours I put the time into it
All of the emotion that I felt
You hate me then you hating on yourself
My hand around her waist I'm like a belt
Wealth so hard to get
Keep it anonymous
Cause once the public figures out
Targets ain't hard to hit
So proceed with caution
They'll be supporting
For things ya fortune can get
To be from Austin,
You see he God sent
To be so fortunate

Mrs. Mr. Whoever I pray
All the time, All the same
Sadly I see things I thought would change
All the time, All the same
I don't want shit I just called to say
How's your day? Can't complain
My phone open to you all today
Work two ways

I'm tired of motherfuckers hitting me up like you never hit me up
Well that's what's up
People be focused up on the accolades
People you call your friends get to acting up
It's sad as fuck
Never satisfied
People that I looked up to I'm passing by
Doing everything I said I would be doing
You never hear a nigga say that Saba lied
Since a pacifier and the crib
I was mad inspired as a kid
No she didn't want me back then
Now she Caroline in a ditch
Took it as a lesson
We don't wanna rush in
Took her to a restaurant
Now she is undressing
I said it would happen
That was manifesting
And she threw it at me like a penny to a freshman aw

Mrs. Mr. Whoever I pray
All the time, All the same
Sadly I see things I thought would change
All the time, All the same
I don't want shit I just called to say
How's your day? Can't complain
My phone open to you all today
Work two ways
