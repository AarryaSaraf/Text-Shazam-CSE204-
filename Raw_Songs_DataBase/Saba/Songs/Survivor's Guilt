Tell the story about-

Even in the wintertime they identifyin' all these niggas dyin'
Ain't no breakin' time for the bacon, swine
Is a peace of mind worth leavin' everything you knew behind?
Move another town and
Hope the trauma don't amount to what you do in life
'Cause some people didn't make it doin' life
Yeah, my people need vacation on a island
All the people sayin' we made it, sorta lyin'
I got no alliance to no corporate buyers
Raise the mortgage higher
I'm stand my ground like a fuckin' squatter
My father told me that the world was mine and I believed him
My momma said I was a heathen
My grandma was the one to feed us
I'm the one that paid my sister tuition, I should probably go to the meetings
My grandpa smilin' with no teeth in, my cousin still supposed to be h-
Ayy, ayy, ayy, raised below poverty
Now I keep it sacred geometry, I'm with my circle
I'm trainin' for mayhem, but y'all on more triangle
'Cause I saw silly niggas done change up
I'm still on my square like a plaintiff
Be careful, they armed and they dangerous
For diamonds some niggas is spirallin'
They wanna send boxes, but can't contain us, oh my God
I'm tryna move better, what's really eatin' when you from a food desert?
I see the news letters, can't listen to them, they be movin' too careless
This album's confessions of a man movin' quick, wonder he regret it
Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich

Break in the door, 'nother day in the 'Go
I can't take it no more
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Let the snakes do you cold
It's the same as before
If they hate, they some hoes
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Break in the door, 'nother day in the 'Go
I can't take it no more
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Let the snakes do you cold
It's the same as before
If they hate, they some hoes
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)

Even in the summertime it be mothers cryin'
Talkin' out of line, you get undermined
There's some real niggas here that wanna die
No stoppin', make as much as you can, it ain't no option
I'm all across the land, I'm a globetrotter
'Cause I left the fam on my old block
And now I got no choice but to go harder
I plotted on everything, said "I'ma kill everything"
Survivor's guilt rhetoric, I could've been a B
But that thinkin' deadly
We facin' the pressure of family that we watched suffer
I gotta lift 'em up out of the gutter
I make a check and send that to my mother
They root for me like Ireland and Conor McGregor
Loaded up the van, some of them didn't fit
I got you next time we do this again, don't trip
Had zero to my name, so did the gang I was with
Said, "Once we make ten bands, we'll be rich, rich, rich, rich"

Break in the door, 'nother day in the 'Go
I can't take it no more
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Let the snakes do you cold
It's the same as before
If they hate, they some hoes
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Break in the door, 'nother day in the 'Go
I can't take it no more
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Let the snakes do you cold
It's the same as before
If they hate, they some hoes
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Uh

Bitch, I was rich at twenty-one
And I'm still on savage shit like 21
Havin' shit, Niemans and Saks, I'm grappin' it
Walk in, spend twenty K on the average
Real nigga straight off the block with the mills
Used to be broke and my partners on pills
Forty shots ran through the block, I couldn't hear
Spend that guap, now I got rocks in my ears
Stack it up, put up a lot for the kids
Some times you see, but that's not what it is
And when you see me, just acknowledge the G
I'm on top of my shit, 'cause I handle my biz
Stay on the grind, had to plot for some years
Ain't have no fear, I weren't droppin' no tears
Me and my old self we swappin' careers
I'm really lit, but I ride with a gliz
I can't break a sweat, gas up the jet and dip
Rainin', you get wet, I'm strapped, just check my hip
All this VVS, it needs baguettes, it cost a grip
I can tell she wet, she tryna sex me with her lips, swerve

Break in the door, 'nother day in the 'Go
I can't take it no more
Let the snakes do you cold
It's the same as before
If they hate, they some hoes

This came until my mother say "How would you like to come to Chicago and work for me?
And if you don't like it, I send you train fare to come back"
