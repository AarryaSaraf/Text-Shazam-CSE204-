Want the peace, but don't wanna die
It's a one way street though
It's a round trip when we fly
Never one way, one way
New crib by the seaside
On the one way street though
There's a million ways to get by
Never one way, one way

Need a million after taxes, I might spend the shit on fashion
All this flexin' made me stronger, feel like Tony in a mansion
My babymama lookin' she could've won a pageant
I'm not vegan, we been eatin', kick my feet up and get fatter
Sit all day and I play Madden and my mattress California
My address California, when I can't find my controller
I'm like "Fuck it", buy another, it ain't nothin', I got money
We all splurgin' on this dumb shit, 'cause we careless and we youngins
Every nigga with a budget takin' care at least ten buddies
What you need, you know I cover

It's a one way street though
It's a round trip when we fly
Never one way, one way
New crib by the seaside
On the one way street though
There's a million ways to get by
Never one way, one way

I'ma order pasta that I cannot properly pronounce
Keep my doors open 'case a nigga pop up on my couch
Went from couldn't afford it, to a nigga coppin' without counting
None my checks been voidin' since a nigga got me an accountant
Send my mama a quick thousand and we crashed them open houses
All the rappers and Tarzana, in the valley, Calabasas
All my niggas wanna crash here, and my woman friends is ratchet
All my neighbors lookin' at us, lookin' different than they family
A black man with the baggies, so my people in my paddy Know I got it if you ask me

It's a one way street though
It's a round trip when we fly
Never one way, one way
New crib by the seaside
On the one way street though
There's a million ways to get by
Never one way, one way
