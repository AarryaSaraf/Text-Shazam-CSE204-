Album: ThingsTakeTimeTakeTime

// Rae Street //

In the morning I'm slow
I drag a chair over to the window
And I watch what's going on
The garbage truck tiptoes along the road
Light a candle for the sufferin'
Send my best wishes with the wind
All our candles, hopes and prayers
Though well-meanin' they don't mean a thing
Unless we see some change
I might change my sheets today

Well time is money
And money is no man's friend
And all eyes on the pavement
I'm not gonna touch up
Don't worry so much about it

The day begins to shine
The parent teaches the child how to ride
The bike
Walkers side to side
Two dogs entangle, everybody smiles
The pair across the street
One's up the ladder
And one's on their knees
Painting the faded brick
What's the point?
It looks fine from up here

Well time is money
And money is no man's friend
And all eyes on the pavement
I'm not gonna touch up
Don't worry so much about it
I'm just waiting for the day to become night

Next door the kids run amok
The mother screams, "Don't you ever shut up?"
And there's one thing I know
The sun will rise today and tomorrow
We've got a long long way to go

Well time is money
And money is no man's friend
And all eyes on the pavement
I'm not gonna touch up
Don't worry so much about it

I'm just waiting for the day to become night
And I'll shine no shoes
In all those worn splits
Get back to normal
Lay it all on the table
Yeah, seem so stable
But you're just hangin' on
Let go that expectation
Change the station
And find out what you want

// Sunfair Sundown //

Oh, what a day, and congrats on the keys to your place
You've escaped the rat race as they say
Now you're settling in for the stay anyway
You got a blank slate to renovate

Take it all
Yeah, you reap what you sow and so it goes
What you put in the ground comes around
When you don't even know what you're missing at all

In a daze, I can picture you whittling away
With such care, with such patience and grace
And I smile when you say that
You'll build me a table one day, well, I'd be so grateful

Sometimes it's hard, getting lost, you say is a fine art
Put the map down and follow the stars
Shall we leave? Are you sure?
Let me grab my bag, we can sneak out through the side door

In the dark, are you scared?
Did you hear those dogs bark?
And do you ever wonder what sets you apart?
Shine the torch on the path, darling, please don't let go of my arm

When you sleep, are you warm? Can you feel my cold feet?
Are you good? Are you making ends meet?
At the end of the day, you're awake with your thoughts
And I don't want you to be alone

And I don't want you to be alone
Yeah, I don't want you to be alone
And I don't want you to be alone

// Here's The Thing //

Here's the thing
Can't stop thinking about you
Yeah, I'm writing
It's the only thing that I know how to do

I don't know what to say, you're so far away
I don't wanna be annoying
I don't know what to say, you're so far away
And I feel insecure

The windowsill
Is momentarily filled with sun
And it's these small thrills
That get me through the day until the next one

And I'm not afraid of heights
Maybe I'm just scared of falling
And I'm not afraid of heights
Maybe I'm just scared of falling

I'm your man
Mysterious at your command
And it's understandable
That you're in such high demand, it's true

I don't know what to do
Is looking like I'll never leave this room again
I don't know what to do
Gonna write this letter to you that I'll never send

Here's the thing
Can't stop thinking about you

// Before You Gotta Go //

Before you gotta go, go, go, go
I wanted you to know, know, know, know
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
If something were to happen my dear
I wouldn't want the last words you hear
To be unkind, to be unkind

We got angry
Said some careless things
Who was wrong remains unclear
Pride like poison
Always keeping score
You don't have to slam the door

Before you gotta go, go, go, go
I wanted you to know, know, know, know
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
If something were to happen my dear
I wouldn't want the last words you hear
To be unkind, to be unkind

Don't you know I'm not your enemy
Maybe let's cut out caffeine
Tomorrow's too late to reminisce
Call me when you get this

Before you gotta go, go, go, go
I wanted you to know, know, know, know
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
If something were to happen my dear
I wouldn't want the last words you hear
To be unkind, to be unkind

Money down the drain
Funny how things change
You got to get away
Yeah, I know and I don't blame you

// Turning Green //

You've been around the world looking for the perfect girl
Turns out she was just living down the street
Living down the street

When you got the time, can I get you on the line?
I want you to tell me everything, tell me everything
I never seen you so happy

The trees are turning green in this springtime
Lethargy is kinda forcing you to see flowers in the weeds

When you got the time, can I get you on the line?
I want you to tell me everything, tell me everything
I never seen you so happy

I hear all your fears and they are understandable, my friend
Why don't you let go of those ideas?
They're never gonna serve you in the end

// Take It Day By Day //

Take it day by day, you gotta put
One foot in front of the other
You'll get what you want
I promise, but don't give up just yet

Maybe tomorrow could be time well spent, reflecting
On all the little things you keep projecting
On everybody that you're so obsessed with
Take a look at yourself

Tuesday night, I'm checking in
Just to see how you're going
Are you good? Are you eating?
I'll call you back next week

Don't stick that knife in the toaster
Baby, life is like a rollercoaster
And there's nothing wrong with getting older
Keep one eye on the prize

Don't give up just yet, you got it
Don't worry your pretty little head
Soon you'll be in bed
Oh, what a long, long day it's been

Tuesday night, I'm checking in
Just to see how you're going
Are you good? Are you eating?
I'll call you back next week

// If I Don't Hear From You Tonight //

Stars in the sky are gonna die eventually, it's fine
Just like a lonely satellite, drifting for a little while

If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight

And it's so quiet outside, with this curfew lullaby
Is now an okay time to tell you that I like you?
I wait for your reply, wait for your reply

If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight

Well, I swear I'll never mention this ever again
But now that I got your attention
I don't wanna bore the brains outta your head

All my fears collided
When our mutual friend confided in me that
There's a ninety-nine percent chance that it's requited

I read my Bible left to right
I fantasize I'm by your side
I lay awake and wonder why
I pray for rain and angels cry

If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight

Babe, I need reminding, I got feelings too
And I tried my best to hide them
But I don't wanna hide anything from you

Stars in the sky are gonna die eventually, it's fine
You know that every morning
I'm rising with you on my mind

If loving you's a crime
Then gimme those front page headlines
Across the country and worldwide
Singing I won't give up this time

If I don't hear from you tonight
I know you probably closed your eyes
And everything will be alright
If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight

// Write A List Of Things To Look Forward To //

Nobody knows, why we keep trying, why we keep trying
And so on it goes, I'm looking forward to the next letter that I'm gonna get from you

A baby is born, as a man lay dying, as a man lay dying
And so on it goes, I'm looking forward to the next letter that I'm gonna get from you

Sit beside me, watch the world burn, we'll never learn we don't deserve nice things
And we'll scream, self-righteously, we did our best but what does that even mean

I'm walking around, walking around
With my head down, my head down
I'm pushing away, I'm pushing away
Yeah I'm pushing away, pushing away

// Splendour //

I say, "Why are you always leaving me?"
You say, "You're the one leaving me"

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no, I am really gonna miss you
Really gonna miss you

Remember when we watched that sunset?
Deep in the desert, on the cliff edge
Some day, so soon, I'll be seeing you
I'll be seeing you

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no, I am really gonna miss you
Really gonna miss you

// Oh The Night //

Oh the night goes so slowly
Anytime I get low
And I don't really need reminding
I know it's only in my mind

And you say, "That's showbiz, baby
Nothing ever stays the same"
But I'm the same kid, always laughing
At your jokes the same old way

Sorry that I've been slow, you know it takes a little
Time for me to show
How I really feel, won't you meet me somewhere in the middle?
On our own time zone

And the days seem so familiar
Like a film you never seen
Yet you still get that strange nostalgia
In the sentimental scenes

Sorry that I've been slow, you know it takes a little
Time for me to show
How I really feel, won't you meet me somewhere in the middle?
On our own time zone

Oh the night goes so slowly
Anytime I get low
And I don't really need reminding
I know it's only in my mind
