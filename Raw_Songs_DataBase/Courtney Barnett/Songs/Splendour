I say, "Why are you always leaving me?"
You say, "You're the one leaving me"

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no, I am really gonna miss you
Really gonna miss you

Remember when we watched that sunset?
Deep in the desert, on the cliff edge
Some day, so soon, I'll be seeing you
I'll be seeing you

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no, I am really gonna miss you
Really gonna miss you
