Yes, they say whoever pays
The piper calls the tune
Oh, let's avoid the truth
Make you all feel special
And your desperation stinks
I can smell it on your breath
A certain absolute anosmic
Got yourself to blame for this

(Tell me how you really feel)
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything

Your opinion means a lot
Well, tell me what's the use
I never feel as stupid as when I'm around you
And indecision rots
Like a bag of last week's meat
And I guess it's hard to keep everybody happy

(Tell me how you really feel)
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything

I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
