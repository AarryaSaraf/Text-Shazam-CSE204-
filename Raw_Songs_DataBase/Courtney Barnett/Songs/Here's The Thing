Here's the thing
Can't stop thinking about you
Yeah, I'm writing
It's the only thing that I know how to do

I don't know what to say, you're so far away
I don't wanna be annoying
I don't know what to say, you're so far away
And I feel insecure

The windowsill
Is momentarily filled with sun
And it's these small thrills
That get me through the day until the next one

And I'm not afraid of heights
Maybe I'm just scared of falling
And I'm not afraid of heights
Maybe I'm just scared of falling

I'm your man
Mysterious at your command
And it's understandable
That you're in such high demand, it's true

I don't know what to do
Is looking like I'll never leave this room again
I don't know what to do
Gonna write this letter to you that I'll never send

Here's the thing
Can't stop thinking about you
