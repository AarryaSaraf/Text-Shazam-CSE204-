Fear is like a forest
The dark of the unknown
Love is like a promise
That you'll never be alone

Touch is like a tourist
You know when you are home
It's not that I'm a purist
It's just I'd rather be alone

Books waiting to be written
Love is waiting to be loved
Songs here, underneath my fingers
Waiting to be sung

Nothing will be written
And no-one ever will I love
No song will I be singing
If it's where I'm running off

But I know that it works
'Cause I've seen that it's true
If you just let it go
It will come back to you

It'll come back in space
It'll come back in pairs
It'll come back in ways
It'll come back 'cause it cares
Come back 'cause it cares
