Don't come with your arms swinging
Throw them around me
Some kind of sweet relief
I hope you never leave

It's all the same to me
Just bring yourself
You know your presence is present enough
I got a front row seat
It's all the same to me
I spend a lot of my time
Doing a whole lot of nothing

I know you're doing your best
I think you're doing just fine

I know it's been a long week
And now you're taking your time
Some kindness goes around
Some kind of backfires

It's all the same to me
Ignore that voice
It puts you down
You make your choice, I'm here for you
It's all the same to me
I got a lot on my mind
But I don't know how to say it

I know you're doing your best
I think you're doing just fine

Keep on keeping on
You know you're not alone
And I know all your stories
But I'll listen to them again
'Cause if you move away
You know I'll miss your face
It's all the same to me
You know it's all the same to me
Keep on keeping on
You know you're not alone
And I know all your stories
But I'll listen to them again
And if you move away
You know I'll miss your face
It's all the same to me
You know it's all the same to me
Keep on keeping on
You know you're not alone
And I know all your stories
But I'll listen to them again
And if you move away
You know I'll miss your face
It's all the same to me
You know it's all the same to me
