You said you liked me at a party 
I said oh well um
Your flatmate was drinking whiskey
You asked me to get you some

I stole your key from your apartment
So you'd have to come around
Stuffed balls of cotton to my sneakers
So I wouldn't make a sound

I disconnected the gas heating
Then suggested movie nights
It got colder, you moved closer
So I cooked us Party Pie

And I did everything to not let you know I liked you
And everything to let you know that I was still around

Like swapping chairs and coughing loudly
Putting on your favorite songs
Standing hidden in the pantry
Hoping you would come along

Like tracing lines into a napkin 
To the shadows of your face
Like dropping you to choir practice
On my U12 study break

And I did everything to not let you know I liked you
And everything to let you know that I was still around

Outside the party it was raining
You were hailing me a cab
I had a plane at seven-thirty
Rain was dripping down my back

I'm pretty sure you said you liked me
But a bottle smashed somewhere
You lent me your road map of Melbourne
I pretended not to care

And I can't stop thinking about what would have happened
If I hadn't gone to Melbourne and gone out to your party

Even though you didn't want me to
I just want you to know
There's still a spot left on my key ring
Just for you
