Stars in the sky are gonna die eventually, it's fine
Just like a lonely satellite, drifting for a little while

If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight

And it's so quiet outside, with this curfew lullaby
Is now an okay time to tell you that I like you?
I wait for your reply, wait for your reply

If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight

Well, I swear I'll never mention this ever again
But now that I got your attention
I don't wanna bore the brains outta your head

All my fears collided
When our mutual friend confided in me that
There's a ninety-nine percent chance that it's requited

I read my Bible left to right
I fantasize I'm by your side
I lay awake and wonder why
I pray for rain and angels cry

If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight

Babe, I need reminding, I got feelings too
And I tried my best to hide them
But I don't wanna hide anything from you

Stars in the sky are gonna die eventually, it's fine
You know that every morning
I'm rising with you on my mind

If loving you's a crime
Then gimme those front page headlines
Across the country and worldwide
Singing I won't give up this time

If I don't hear from you tonight
I know you probably closed your eyes
And everything will be alright
If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight
If I don't hear from you tonight
