"Are you working hard, my darling?
We're so worried, always thinking of you.
And we just want you to be so happy, keep on going."

"I don't want no 9 to 5
Telling me that I'm alive
And 'Man, you're doing well!'"

"Have you got some money saved up for those rainy days?
You should start some sort of trust fund...
Just in case you fail."

"My friends play in bands.
They are better than everything on radio."

"Did you see that special on TV the other eve?"

"No, my TV, it stopped working when we got here.
(It's been four years.)"

"Are you eating? You sound so thin..."

"I don't know what I was thinking. I should get a job.
I don't know what I was drinking. I should get a dog.
Should get married, have some babies, watch the evening news."
