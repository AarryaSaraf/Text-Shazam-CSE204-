I could never make it in your house
You could never make it in mine
Even if we were both well then
I'm born in another time

Just like a circle around the sun
Just like a circle around the sun
When my song has just begun
Just like a circle around the sun

I could never make it in your jail
You could never make it in mine
Even if we were both well then
I'm born in another time

Just like a circle around the sun
I got my ticket in my hand
Then I'm bound for the promise land
Just like a circle around the sun

I could never lay down in your ditch
You would never want to in mine
Even if we were both well then
I'm born in another time

Just like a circle around the sun
Just like a circle around the sun
When my song has just begun
Like a circle around the sun

I'd never make it in your house
You could never make it in mine
Even if we were both well then
I'm born in another time

Just like a circle around the sun
Just like a circle around the sun
When my song has just begun
Just like a circle around the sun
