Before you gotta go, go, go, go
I wanted you to know, know, know, know
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
If something were to happen my dear
I wouldn't want the last words you hear
To be unkind, to be unkind

We got angry
Said some careless things
Who was wrong remains unclear
Pride like poison
Always keeping score
You don't have to slam the door

Before you gotta go, go, go, go
I wanted you to know, know, know, know
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
If something were to happen my dear
I wouldn't want the last words you hear
To be unkind, to be unkind

Don't you know I'm not your enemy
Maybe let's cut out caffeine
Tomorrow's too late to reminisce
Call me when you get this

Before you gotta go, go, go, go
I wanted you to know, know, know, know
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
If something were to happen my dear
I wouldn't want the last words you hear
To be unkind, to be unkind

Money down the drain
Funny how things change
You got to get away
Yeah, I know and I don't blame you
