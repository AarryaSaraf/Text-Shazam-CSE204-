// Check Your Groove //

I could fly
But tonight I'm not an angel
Only music can take me so high
Oh yeah
From the moment I heard the beat
There was fire under my feet
And you were passing by

And you've got the fever, fast and strong
Didn't care for the second song now
I know where to find what you want

Check your groove at the door
Come and meet me on the floor
Tell the DJ, that we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Fell the rhythm slip and slide
Let me show you the beat that you've been missing

I could lie
But you know there's nothing better
Funky music never runs out of time
From the minute I heard the groove
There was something making me move
Couldn't let it pass me by

And you've got the message, loud and clear
But didn't want me to disappear
I know where to take it from here baby, yeah

Check your groove at the door
Come and meet me on the floor
Tell the DJ, that we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Let the rhythm slip and slide
Let me show you the beat that you've been missing

You've got the fire
You've got the fever, baby

Check your groove at the door
Come and meet me on the floor
Tell the DJ, that we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Let the rhythm slip and slide
Let me show you the beat that you've been missing
Check your groove at the door
Tell the DJ, we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Let me show you the beat that you've been missing
Check your groove at the door

Check your groove at the door
Come and meet me on the floor
Tell the DJ, that we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Feel the rhythm slip and slide
Let me show you the beat that you've been missing

Check your groove at the door
Come and meet me on the floor
Tell the DJ, that we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Feel the rhythm slip and slide
Let me show you

// Down To The River //

Take me down, baby, oh

I've been searching high, I went so low
Anywhere love could be that's where I go
If you give me the answer, I wouldn't know

I've been out in the cold, please take me in
There's a whole lot of love I have to give
And I want you to save me from my sins

Now I'm ready to turn the page, baby (Turn the page)
You can show me a better way

Why don't you take me down to the river, baby
Bathe my soul in the midnight hour
I've been waiting forever, baby
You got the power over me

They say the water is deep, but I don't care
I can swim against tides, go anywhere
Just as long as it's you that takes me there
Tell me 'bout it

Now I'm ready to justify, baby (Justify)
You can show me a reason why

Why don't you take me down to the river, baby
Bathe my soul in the midnight hour
I've been waiting forever, baby
You got the power over me

So come on, take me down to the river, baby
Let me go to the other side
We can do this together, if you
Let me take that heavenly ride

Let me take a ride, baby
Won't you, won't you, won't you, come, come, come, come, get me now

Now I have you here at last
I was hoping you would find me
Whatever happened in the past
There's no need to remind me

It's time to take me down to the river, baby
Bathe my soul in the midnight hour
I've been waiting forever, baby
You got the power that I need

So come on, take me down to the river, baby
Let me go to the other side (The other side)
We can do this together, if you
Let me take that heavenly ride
Let me take that heavenly ride

Won't you let me, let me take that heavenly ride
Let me take that heavenly ride

Take me down to the river, baby
Take me tonight
Take me down to the river, baby
Take me to the other side (Take me to the other side)

Take me down to the river, baby
Take me tonight
Take me down to the river, baby
Wash my soul and let it dry (Let it dry)

// Living In Colour //

Sometimes I had to wonder
What we did before you came
Back then life was classified
In different shades of grey

Oh there was so much resistance
To the dreams of a brand new day
We didn't learn to listen
Until you had your say

Don't be afraid of what is right
Just take a step into the light
And when you open up your eyes

You're living in colour
One another
Whether you're black or white or blue
You're living in colour
Oh brother
That's all we have to do

Back there in the shadows
Seemed the safest place to be
Wheels were turning, fires were burning
They were marching in a street

Oh, you had a different vision
Of the way this world should be
Something I've been missing
Until you said to me

Don't be afraid to speak your mind
It come up from behind
Don't you now that it's time

For living in colour
One another
Whether you're black or white or blue
You're living in colour
Oh my brother
That's all we have to do

Living in colour
It's taken
More than a lifetime on the way
Living in colour
No mistaken
That's what I heard you say

Don't be afraid of what is right
Take a step into the light
Don't be afraid to speak your mind
Don't you know that it's time

For living in colour
One another
Whether you're black or white or blue
You're living in colour
Oh my brother
That's all we have to do

Living in colour
It's taken
More than a lifetime on the way
Living in colour
No mistaken
That's what I heard you say

Living in colour
One another
Whether you're black or white or blue
You're living in colour
Oh my brother
That's all we have to do

Living in colour
It's taken
More than a lifetime on the way
Living in colour
No mistaken
That's what I heard you say

// One Of My Heartbeats //

I don't think I'm an easy touch
I've been 'round the world
And I know this much
If my heart is like an open door
It's been broken down
Yeah, I've been here before
Nothing could prepare me for you
Now I'm finding out
How much I never knew (yeah)
I think this might be the perfect crime (oh yeah)
You gave your heart and walked away with mine

One of my heartbeats is missing
And I'm blaming it all on you
Taking me right out of my rhythm
With the simple things you do

Hmm
Hard to know if this is what you planned
Was I in your sight?
Was it slight of hand?
Did you take me for some innocent
Who was passing by
Or was this what you made?
Everybody has a weaknesses (yeah)
Now I'm finding out, is all it really is
I know this could be the perfect crime
You show your heart but walked away with mine

One of my heartbeats is missing
And I'm blaming it all on you
Taking me right out of my rhythm
With the simple things you do

One of my heartbeats is missing
It was taken away with a smile
Could it have been while we were kissing
Then I have to admire your style

Ooh, I could get used to the feeling of
Being apart of your fantasy (oh)
Oh whether heart you are stealing
Was thinking about you brought to my knees, ooh-ooh

Ooh, one of my heartbeats is missing
And I'm blaming it all on you
Taking me right out of my rhythm
With the simple things you do

One of my heartbeats is missing
It was taken away with a smile
Could it have been while we were kissing
Then I have to admire your style

One of my heartbeats is missing
Oh I'm blaming it all on you, baby (ooh)
Taking me right out of my rhythm, oo
With the simple things you do

One of my heartbeats is missing
It was taken away with your smile, yeah (with your smile, my baby)
Could it have been while we were kissing
Then I have to admire your style (your style)
One of my heartbeats is missing

// Close To You Tonight //

Another hotel window
And the night is closing in
I should be anticipating
What tonight in the city will bring
All these places that I get to see (all the places)
Now they all look the same to me

I wanna be close, baby
(By your side as you're turning out the lights) turning out the lights
(What to do with the love that burns inside)
Oh, the love that burns inside of me, baby
(I just wanna be close to you tonight)

There's a train out at midnight
But that's a fantasy I know
So I hold on for another day
Every night a different show
All these faces are waiting for me (all these faces)
They don't know where I'd rather be

Closer tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah
(By your side as you're turning out the lights)
Turning, turning out the lights, baby
(What to do with the love that burns inside)
Oh, with the love that burns inside
(I just wanna be close to you tonight) oh

I can't wait for this lonely road to end, oh baby
So many miles that I have to go
Before I'm in your arms again

I just wanna be close to you, girl
(By your side as you're turning out the lights)
Oh, turning out the lights, yeah
(What to do with the love that burns inside)
Oh, this love, girl, burning inside of me
(I just wanna be close to you tonight)
I just wanna be, wanna be, yeah

I, yeah, I need to be with you
(By your side as you're turning out the lights)
By your side, baby, yeah
(What to do with the love that burns inside)
Oh that burns inside, yeah, that burns inside, yeah
(I just wanna be close to you tonight)

// Half Moon In The Crescent City //

Driving down the magazines
I don't know just where I'll be
Heading for the Bong-Tong, the new lake
There's a town sitting next to me
Looks fine but then she ought to be
A little too much whiskey on the way, a-ha

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen
Oh yeah let it shine

I'm walking east on Ramp-out Street
I can't stop my feet
Heading for the sound of the trumpet

There's coming at these rythm kings
To getting on with that fame
Of uncle Joe's 'cause it caught on the cafeine
That's right y'all

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty, so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen
Shine awhile y'all

Let it shine

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen

Another delta night is gone
Walking through the dawn
Heading for some coffee and beignet

Some ghosts are walking next to me
Blue with, but the end of their teeth
I guess I got some company today, oh yeah

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen
Yeah

Don't drop it now
Don't drop it now

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen
One more time

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty, so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen
Don't you dare to be alone
Oh yeah

Oh that's one at a time
Down to Queen-be street
Who knows who you're gonna meet
All night long

Up they stay
At the Bong-Tong blue lake
They're gonna dance their mourn away
Ooh
I will stay here a while

// Think Small //

This is a group thing in the
Manor and all style of Cannonball Adderley
Herby Hancock, Crusaders
All the stuff we grew up on
We call this "Think Small"
Hmm
Oh yeah

Ooh, oh yeah
You won't
You say you better think small yeah?
Ah-ah, you can't have it all, no, no, no, no, no
You better, you better
You better, better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better

Ooh
You know you better think small
'Cause you can't have it all, no no
Yeah baby
Alright thank you

// I Can't Help It //

When we were finding what it means to be in love
The passion ruled out any reason
We should have known there was no sanction from above
But Cupid never had a feel of treason

I never doubted time and distance would decide
What set of rules that we would live by
But all the years and all our differences aside
And there was love nobody could deny

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (still in love, girl)
And despite the things we put each other through (all little the things you do)
Little memories are far between and few (oh yeah, yeah)
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Yeah, there were days when the silence was so loud
It seemed we dined on our emotions
And it was clear that we would never be allowed
To find a haven from that raging ocean

No one can help us with all their good advice
We had to stand and watch it go by
Put all our tears and all our suffering aside
And there was love nobody could deny

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (still in love with you, yeah)
And despite the things we put each other through (all the little things we did)
Little memories are far between and few
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Tell me
Still in love with you
No matter what you do
I'll be watching over you
Still in love with, still in love with you
Even if you're out there having fun with someone else

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (I can't help it, girl)
And despite the things we put each other through (despite the thing we did, girl)
Little memories are far between and few (far between and few, yeah)
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (still in love, still in love)

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (oh no, no)
And despite the things we put each other through (all the little things we did, yeah)
Little memories are far between and few (far between and few, yeah)
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (I can't help it, oh no this feeling girl)
And despite the things we put each other through (despite the things we put each other through)
Little memories are far between and few (oh yeah they are, oh yeah they are)
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

// I'm Gonna Make You Love Me //

I'm gonna do all the things for you
A girl wants a man to do, oh baby (oh baby)
I'll sacrifice for you
Always do what's right for you, oh baby (oh baby)

Every minute, every hour

You with love and affection
Look out, it's comin' in your direction

// Love Won't Let Me Wait //

The time is right
You hold me tight
Love's got me high
Please say 'Yes'
Don't say 'No'
Honey, not tonight

Move a little close to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly
Take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait baby
Oh darling

The time is right
Turn down the lights
Take my hand
We'll take a flight
Spend the night in Wonderland

And I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave
'Til I see the morning sun
Creep through your window pane
And love won't let me wait
No, baby

Now move a little close to me
You owe it to yourself
I will selfishly
Take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait
I won't need it down there
Love won't let me wait
Temperature's risin'
Love won't let me wait
It wasn't suprise, baby
Love won't let me wait
Not for one moment baby
Love won't let me wait
