// Growing Pains //

Don't cry, baby
Dry those tears
You know it isn't the end of your world
Even though it may seem like it, girl
It's only growing pains
Ask why, baby
Why those fears?
Things aren't really as bad as they seems (even in your wildest dreams)
Honey, even in your wildest dreams
It's only growing pains, oh, baby

Growing pains are just the part the livin' (oh, oh)
This you got to realize (gotta realize)
Don't bothered by what was going wrong in your life
If you do, you might wind up breakin' your heart

Don't cry, baby (don't cry)
Dry those tears
Time is the way it will heal
(You will lose the hurt you feel)
You'll lose all of the hurt you feel
'Cause it's only growing pains, oh, baby
It's only growing pains

Growing pains are just the part of livin' (oh, oh)
This you got to realize (gotta realize)
Don't bothered by what was going wrong in your life
If you do, you might wind up breakin' your heart, oh, oh

Growing pains are just the part of livin' (oh, oh)
This you got to realize (got to realize)
Don't bothered by what was going
What's going wrong in your life
If you do, you might wind up breakin' your heart (oh oh)

(Growing pains)
Growing pains are just the part of livin'
(Woo-ooh-ooh, ooh)
This you got to realize (gotta realize)
Don't bothered by what was going
What's going wrong in your life

// Harvest For The World //

All babies together, everyone a seed
Half of us are satisfied, half of us in need
Love's bountiful in us, tarnished by our greed
When will there be a harvest for the world

Harvest for the world
Harvest for the world
Harvest for the world

A nation planted, so concerned with gain
As the seasons come and go, greater grows the pain
And far too many feelin' the strain
When will there be a harvest for the world

Harvest for the world
Harvest for the world
Harvest for the world

Gather everyman, gather every woman
Celebrate your lives, give thanks for your children
Gather everyone, gather all together
Overlooking none, hopin' life gets better for the world

Harvest for the world
Harvest for the world
Harvest for the world

Dress me up for battle, when all I want is peace
Those of us who pay the price, come home with the least
Nation after nation, turning into beast
When will there be a harvest for the world

Harvest for the world
Harvest for the world
Harvest for the world

// I Heard It Through The Grapevine //

Baby I know
I heard it through
I heard I through
I heard it through
Said, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh baby
I bet you're wondering, how I knew
About your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys, you know love you more
You took me by surprise
When I heard you just met yesterday
Don't you know heard it through the grapevine
Not that sure you'll be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And honey, I'm about to lose my mind
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
Ooh you know a man ain't suppose to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see

Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you've gone and found someone else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine, that no longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine, honey I'm just about to lose my mind
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be, my baby
People say they hide from what you see
So, in love with what you hear
I've been hurt I've been confused
But if it's true, won't you tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For another guy who says he loves you more
'Cause I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine, and honey I'm just about to lose my mind
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be, my baby
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be, my baby
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be, my baby

// Miss Sun //

Listen to my story (You may never be the same)
A young man in his glory (He may never see her again, oh no)

Hey Miss Sun, what can I say?
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning finds you back in my arms
Back in my arms

If I could just remember (What she told me in her eyes)
Until I can remember (There I stand in this fool's disguise, yes I do)

Hey Miss Sun, what can I say?
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning finds you back in my arms
Back in my arms

A young man in his glory (A young man in his glory)
He may never see her again

Hey Miss Sun, what can I say?
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning finds you back in my arms
Back in my arms

Hey Miss Sun, what can I say?
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning finds you back in my arms
Back in my arms

It won't be long, no

Hey Miss Sun, what can I say?
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning finds you back in my arms
Back in my arms

// Shower The People //

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, oh
Now here something new

You can play the game
You can act out the part
Though you know it wasn't written for you
Tell me how can you stand there
With your broken heart
Ashamed of playin' a fool?

When one thing can lead to another
It doesn't take any sacrifice
Father and mother
Sister and brother
If it feels right
Don't think twice

Just shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel (show them the way that you feel)
Things are gonna work out fine (things are gonna work out fine)
(If you only will) if you only will

What I wanna say to you is
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel, oh
Things are gonna be much better
If you only will, hmm
Only will

You can run but you cannot hide
This is widely known
And what you plan to do
With your foolish pride
When you're all by yourself alone

Once you tell somebody
The way that you feel
You can feel it begin to ease

Its true what they say
About the squeaky wheel
Always getting the grease
And it's better to

Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel (show them the way you feel)
Things are gonna be just fine
If you only will
What I wanna say to you is

Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way (show them the way you feel)
Things are gonna be much better
If you only will
Only will, only will hmm oh-ooh-oh

In every life a little bit of rain must fall
No one can have it all, no

So let me tell you
Shower the people (in every life yeah)
Show them the way (some rain must fall, yes it will)
Shower the people (just like a pouring rain)
Show them the way you feel (make it rain)
Shower the people you (make it rain with love, love, love)
Show them the way (said shower yeah)

Shower the people (oh make it rain, oh Lord)
Show them the way that you feel (make it rain)
Shower the people you love (you gotta love somebody)
Show them the way you feel (don't be afraid to show them how you feel)
Shower the people (with the real love in our heart now)
Show them the way (way)
Show them the way
