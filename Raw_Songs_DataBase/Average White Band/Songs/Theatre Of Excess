Welcome to the theatre of excess
Welcome to the theatre of excess
If you feel you need some stimulation
There is just one thing I'd like to subtest

We would like to afford to live variation
Won't you join us to the theatre of excess?
Bring your fantasy to the stage
Oh, don't imagine do what I beg

Shouldn't stop till you drop
Never stop
Welcome to the theatre of excess
Welcome to the theatre of excess

Now it's time to make your exhibition
You must find a move to express
We will help you shed your deepest inhibition
If you step into the theatre of excess

When we at it, we becomes too much
Oh, more at it with the right touch
Take it to the limit, don't you know?
We never fuzz

Welcome to the theatre of excess
Welcome to the theatre of excess

Welcome to the theatre of excess
Welcome to the theatre of excess
Welcome to the theatre of excess

Welcome to the theatre of excess
Welcome to the theatre of excess
Welcome to the theatre of excess
Welcome to the theatre of excess
Welcome to the theatre of excess
It's great
