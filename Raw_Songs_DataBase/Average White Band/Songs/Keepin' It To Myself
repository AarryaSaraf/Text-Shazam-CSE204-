Now and again it occurs to me
I'm giving away much more than I ought to be
Oh, yes I am
And then today I get a letter
Telling me things that I better not believe
But I don't know if I can (just don't know if I can)

But you're the last in a long, long line of mistakes I've made
(They gonna do it again)
I'm tired of giving my heart and soul to a masquerade
So I'm gonna be

Keepin' it to myself
Let it build on up inside of me, yeah
I'll be keepin' it to myself
Baby, I tried, I tried

Well it makes no difference
I always thought that it was planned
When you get everything a man has to give
You know you got to return it (got to return it)
But every time I build my dreams (every time)
Find that love is not what it seems to be
And I keep on getting burned (keep gettin' burned by love)

But from now I'm gonna quit
Before I commit myself
To any woman I meet
And I'll get by without love for a while
And get into something else

I'll be keepin' it to myself
Let it build on up inside me, yeah, yeah
I'll be keepin' it to myself
Woman, I tried, oh babe

So I'll be keepin' it to myself
All to myself (never be alone, yeah inside of me)
Well, well, I'll be keepin' it to myself
Yeah honey I, I...
Don't you know, don't you know I try? (Keepin' it to myself)
Hey baby I try (all to myself) oh baby
Hey, yeah, I try! (Keepin' it to myself) yeah well

Sure though, I try
Say I ain't, ain't gonna tell nobody (keepin' it to myself)
I ain't gonna tell no one (all to myself)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be (keepin' it to myself)
Well yeah, I'll be...
Hey, ain't gonna tell nobody (keepin' it to myself)
I'll be keepin' it (all to myself)
Hey, hey, I'll be keeping it (to myself)
Sugar, I'll be...
