I don't think I'm an easy touch
I've been 'round the world
And I know this much
If my heart is like an open door
It's been broken down
Yeah, I've been here before
Nothing could prepare me for you
Now I'm finding out
How much I never knew (yeah)
I think this might be the perfect crime (oh yeah)
You gave your heart and walked away with mine

One of my heartbeats is missing
And I'm blaming it all on you
Taking me right out of my rhythm
With the simple things you do

Hmm
Hard to know if this is what you planned
Was I in your sight?
Was it slight of hand?
Did you take me for some innocent
Who was passing by
Or was this what you made?
Everybody has a weaknesses (yeah)
Now I'm finding out, is all it really is
I know this could be the perfect crime
You show your heart but walked away with mine

One of my heartbeats is missing
And I'm blaming it all on you
Taking me right out of my rhythm
With the simple things you do

One of my heartbeats is missing
It was taken away with a smile
Could it have been while we were kissing
Then I have to admire your style

Ooh, I could get used to the feeling of
Being apart of your fantasy (oh)
Oh whether heart you are stealing
Was thinking about you brought to my knees, ooh-ooh

Ooh, one of my heartbeats is missing
And I'm blaming it all on you
Taking me right out of my rhythm
With the simple things you do

One of my heartbeats is missing
It was taken away with a smile
Could it have been while we were kissing
Then I have to admire your style

One of my heartbeats is missing
Oh I'm blaming it all on you, baby (ooh)
Taking me right out of my rhythm, oo
With the simple things you do

One of my heartbeats is missing
It was taken away with your smile, yeah (with your smile, my baby)
Could it have been while we were kissing
Then I have to admire your style (your style)
One of my heartbeats is missing
