Baby now, why don't you let me stop
Show you how we have ourselves a good time
Get on up till you drop, I won't make it any secrets
She said "Let it out, and lay it next to mine"

Do ya really wanna have fun
Come and funk with me baby
Do ya really wanna get high by yourself
Do ya really wanna have fun
Get a jump on it baby
Don't you really wanna just try something else

Move me, do me up, this girl's got juice
She don't know what she's doing to me
My degrees, I believe that this could lead to love
Especially the way she said to me

Do ya really wanna have fun
Come and funk with me baby
Do ya really wanna get high by yourself
Do ya really wanna have fun
Get a jump on it baby
Don't you really wanna just try something else

Whatever else you might have shaken
You'll be welcome baby, right there by my side
Whatever hearts you might be breaking now baby
My arms are always open wide

Do ya really wanna have fun
Come and funk with me baby
Do ya really wanna get high by yourself
Do ya really wanna have fun
Get a jump on it baby
Don't you really wanna just try something else

Do ya really wanna have fun
Come and funk with me baby
Do ya really wanna get high by yourself
Do ya really wanna have fun
Get a jump on it baby
Don't you really wanna just try something else
