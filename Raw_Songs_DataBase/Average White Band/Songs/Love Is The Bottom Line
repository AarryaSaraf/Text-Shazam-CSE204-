My appeal to you
I give you all the love, the love you need
And you know that's hard to find
I give you everything, your heart desires
If it gives you peace of mind

So you say you don't believe
Love is ever guaranteed
That's a feeling I don't buy
Would it make a difference
Won't you give my love a chance
All you got to do is try

You say that love don't mean a thing
When you've got money, you got everything
But that's a song that's out of time
You know that love is the bottom line
It's the bottom line

Now I've been working day and night
What you want don't come for free
But that's the price I pay for loving you
And it really doesn't matter to me

So you say you don't believe
Love is ever guaranteed
That's a feeling I don't buy
Would it make a difference
Won't you give my love a chance
All you got to do is try

You say that love don't mean a thing
When you've got money, you got everything
But that's a song that's out of time
You know that love is the bottom line
It's the bottom line
