Diamonds and furs woah
Bleached or torn blue jeans
What you wear could never matter baby
(You shall blew it all)
Sad it don't last oh (this is sad)
To the point you stop it
Oh everyone is overboard for you

Ooh you are everybody's darling, you know that you are
Sweet talk wherever you go
But you maybe everybody's darling
But where can you run to when you are all alone
Ooh you are everybody's darling, you know that you are
Sweet talk wherever you show
But you maybe everybody's darling
But where can you turn to when you are all alone

Shining sunny (shining sunny)
Groovy on a Monday
Baby, don't you worry, no
'Cause you got it all in the palm of your hand

Everybody's darling, you know that you are
Sweet talk wherever you go
Oh you maybe everybody's darling
But where can you run to when you are all alone
Oh yes, you are everybody's darling, you know that you are
Sweet talk wherever you show
But you maybe everybody's darling
But where can you turn to when you are all alone

Oh sometimes you gonna be alone oh-oh
Everybody's darling (yeah, yes, yes you are)
If you wanna know by now baby
Ooh precious little darling
Oh that's what you are, something special to me baby
Ooh baby, gotta keep on trying
Don't make the blues get you down baby
Everybody's darling oh-oh oh-oh
Ye-aah
Precious little darling
Gotta keep on trying
You know you must make it keep on smiling
Ooh darling
Ooh darling, ooh, ooh
