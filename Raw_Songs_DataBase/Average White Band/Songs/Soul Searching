Sometimes I'm lazy or maybe just holding back
Anyway it's hard to know the difference
Sometimes I get crazy
But if I do it doesn't matter, no no

What I'm doing is
Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper everyday (diggin' a little bit deeper everyday)
Soul searching
Looking inside trying to find the way (lookin' inside)
Then it all adds up to what I'm trying to say, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

There's nothing here without trying, hope you get inspired
Got to find your imagination, oh
All it needs is one spark to kindle a fire within your body

So you see me really
Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper everyday (diggin' a little bit deeper everyday)
Soul searching
Looking inside trying to find the way (lookin' inside)
Then it all adds up to what we have to say
No, it ain't no harm in trying anyway (anyway)

Sometimes we make music
Sometimes we make love
Still we keep on trying

Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper everyday, baby (diggin' a little bit deeper everyday)
Soul searching
Looking inside trying to find the way, baby (lookin' inside)
Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper everyday (diggin' a little bit deeper everyday)
Then it all adds up to what we're trying to say
It's no use, no use crying to yourself, girl
No, and it ain't no harm in trying anyway

What we're doing is soul searching, searching, searching, searching, searching
