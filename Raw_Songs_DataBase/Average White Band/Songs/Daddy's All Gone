I don't have much to say
Thought I'd call you up anyway
Just to try to show you the way
That I feel today
I miss you, baby

I sure am on the road
I don't need to say much more
Just the same old well, known stranger
That I was before
It seems like yesterday now

Daddy's all gone
Only half way home
He's holding on to the telephone
Saying please don't let the show go on

There's a bus every other hour

There's even the midnight train
But that don't leave me the power
To see your face again
It's not that simple

You see there's a room full
Of smiling faces
There's a man standing by the door
Say it's time to change our places
And get down on the floor
Kill 'em, baby

Daddy's all gone
He's just half way home
He's holding on to the microphone
Singing please don't make the show go on
