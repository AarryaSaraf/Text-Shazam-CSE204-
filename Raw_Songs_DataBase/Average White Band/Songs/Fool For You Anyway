Oh baby, oh baby
I thought I could make it without you, you know that
But I found out, found out
I need somebody to wake up with me early in the mornin'
And I found out I need someone to fix my food
Take good care of me

I'm so lonely
See I'm lonely
But I'm not lonely for anybody but you
And I gotta have you
I need your loving so bad
Woman I'm not ashamed
Not ashamed to say I need your lovin' so bad
Oh girl, mm-hmm

Well, I miss you, honey
A little more every day
And I know if I kiss you, oh babe
You'd be comin' back home to stay, yes you will

'Cause I know I was wrong, oh
But how long do I have to pay?
Oh babe
Do you know you belong here beside me?

I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, babe)
I'm a fool for you anyway (just a fool)
I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, baby)

Well, I cried for you so long
Tears ran down like rain
And I tried to be so strong, so strong
But I felt every bit of the pain

You know your love left a mark on me
I don't think it would fade away (fade away) oh babe
I'll sit here and wait 'til you come home, baby
I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, babe)
I'm a fool for you anyway (just a fool)
I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, babe)
(Oh babe, oh babe)

You know your love put a mark on me
I don't think it would fade away (fade away)
I'll sit here and wait 'til you come home, honey
I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, babe)
I'm a fool for you anyway (just a fool)
I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, I'm just a fool)

I can't help myself (I'm a fool for you, babe)
Honey, I don't know what else (I'm a fool for you, I'm just a fool)
I'm a fool for you (I'm a fool for you, babe)
Oh baby, I'm a fool for you (I'm a fool for you, I'm just a fool)
I can come turn you on (I'm a fool for you, babe)
Sugar 'cause your love is strong (I'm a fool for you, I'm just a fool)

I'm a fool for you (I'm a fool for you, babe)
Oh baby, I'm a fool (I'm a fool for you, I'm just-)
