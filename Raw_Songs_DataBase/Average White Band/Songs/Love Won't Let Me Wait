The time is right
You hold me tight
Love's got me high
Please say 'Yes'
Don't say 'No'
Honey, not tonight

Move a little close to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly
Take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait baby
Oh darling

The time is right
Turn down the lights
Take my hand
We'll take a flight
Spend the night in Wonderland

And I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave
'Til I see the morning sun
Creep through your window pane
And love won't let me wait
No, baby

Now move a little close to me
You owe it to yourself
I will selfishly
Take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait
I won't need it down there
Love won't let me wait
Temperature's risin'
Love won't let me wait
It wasn't suprise, baby
Love won't let me wait
Not for one moment baby
Love won't let me wait
