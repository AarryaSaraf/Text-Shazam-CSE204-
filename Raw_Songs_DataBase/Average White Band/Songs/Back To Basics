Well it's all right, it's all right

Living hard, living fast in the city
There's got to be a way to make it slow down
Doing what we do, is human nature
That's the way it goes
It gets so hard, trying to make a living
We've got to give the love back to our brothers
Trying to find some time, for one another
So we know it's for real

I wanna get back to basics
I wanna get back with you
Back to basics, like we use to do
I wanna get back to basics, just take it slow
Back to basics, and just let it go (let it go)

You know at times you get a little crazy
Running round, looking for some direction
On the streets, nothings very simple
But I know it's for real

I wanna get back to basics
I wanna get back with you
Back to basics, like we use to do
I wanna get back to basics, just take it slow
Back to basics, ah, just let it go (let it go)

Nothing matters but, good old fashioned love
Let's just face it, all it takes is basic love

I wanna get back to basics
I wanna get back with you
Back to basics, like we use to do
I wanna get back to basics, just take it slow
Back to basics, ah, just let it go (let it go)

I wanna get back to basics, wanna get back to love
I wanna get back to basics, wanna get back to love
I wanna get back to basics, I wanna get back with you
I wanna get back to basics, baby like we use to do
I wanna get back to basics
