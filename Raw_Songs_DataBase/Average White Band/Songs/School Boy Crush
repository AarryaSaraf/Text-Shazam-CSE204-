Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four
Wait till everybody's (long) gone
There must be so many things that we can explore
Maybe I can walk you home
If it starts to rain, we can take some shelter
I'd like to hold your little hand
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter
We'll get to know each other if we can

She said hey, wait a minute, hold on
She said hey, just a little bit, hold on
When ever I try to think of what it feels like to feel it
For the first time, and was it really such a thrill
She said look, boy, but don't you touch

That ain't much, only a school boy crush

Got to keep this secret, can't take no chance
Don't want nobody else to know
There is nothing wrong with trying to start a romance
(But) we should take it rather slow
If we play it cool, it'll be all right
Don't let the teacher see us talking
But after school we will be out of sight
Everybody gonna think we just gone walkin'
