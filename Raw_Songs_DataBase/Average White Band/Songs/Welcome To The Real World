You said love was just a fantasy
Nothing you need in your life
That little weakness in humanity
You never thought you would try
In my experience you must agree
What all the world's trying to find
Only looking for that special someone
To turn the water to wine

So wake up, look around
Time is slipping through our fingers so fast
Slipping away
If it's love that you've found
Welcome to the real world at last

Could it be you've had a change of heart
Even if it's hard to admit
Every day you're getting closer to me
Why must you try to resist

So wake up, look around
Time is slipping through our fingers so fast
Through our fingers, baby
If it's love that you've found
Welcome to the real world at last

Don't get caught up in the words you say
Let your heart show the way, baby

So wake up, look around
Time is slipping through our fingers so fast
Slipping away
If it's love that you've found
Welcome to the real world at last
...
