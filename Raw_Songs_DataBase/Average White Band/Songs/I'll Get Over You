I'll get over you, it won't take long
You'll see somebody who'll be twice as strong
Now I'm looking through different eyes
Honey, don't be surprised when I get over you

Thought we were flying high
No sign of stormy skies in our way
But then a flash of light
Turned around and I was shot down in place
You expected a different reaction
I can't give you that satisfaction
Oh baby

I'll get over you, it won't take long
You'll see somebody who'll be twice as strong
Now I'm looking through different eyes
Honey, don't be surprised when I get over you
When I get over you, babe

What you gonna say when you see I'm already back on my feet? (Back on my feet)
What made you think that I would fall apart and be down on my knees? (Down on my knees)
You didn't hear me when I was callin'
The way you look, you're the one who's fallin'
Oh baby

I'll get over you, it won't take long
You'll see somebody who'll be twice as strong
Now I'm looking through different eyes
Honey, don't be surprised when I get over you

You might find you're really out of my head
Oh, ask yourself, baby
Is this what you meant when you'll get over me?

I'll get over you
Over get over
I'll find someone new
I'll get over you
Over get over
And when I do babe
I'll get over

I'll get over you, it won't take long
You'll see somebody who'll be twice as strong
Now I'm looking through different eyes
Honey, don't be surprised when I get over

I'll get over you, it won't take long
You'll see somebody who'll be twice as strong
Now I'm looking through different eyes
Honey, don't be surprised when I get over you

Oh no, baby
I tell you, it won't be long
I'm gonna be twice as strong
Uh-uh-uh-uh baby when I get over you
You expected a different reaction
I can't give you that satisfaction
Don't be surprised when I get over
Flying high on my body
