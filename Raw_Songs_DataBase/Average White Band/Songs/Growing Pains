Don't cry, baby
Dry those tears
You know it isn't the end of your world
Even though it may seem like it, girl
It's only growing pains
Ask why, baby
Why those fears?
Things aren't really as bad as they seems (even in your wildest dreams)
Honey, even in your wildest dreams
It's only growing pains, oh, baby

Growing pains are just the part the livin' (oh, oh)
This you got to realize (gotta realize)
Don't bothered by what was going wrong in your life
If you do, you might wind up breakin' your heart

Don't cry, baby (don't cry)
Dry those tears
Time is the way it will heal
(You will lose the hurt you feel)
You'll lose all of the hurt you feel
'Cause it's only growing pains, oh, baby
It's only growing pains

Growing pains are just the part of livin' (oh, oh)
This you got to realize (gotta realize)
Don't bothered by what was going wrong in your life
If you do, you might wind up breakin' your heart, oh, oh

Growing pains are just the part of livin' (oh, oh)
This you got to realize (got to realize)
Don't bothered by what was going
What's going wrong in your life
If you do, you might wind up breakin' your heart (oh oh)

(Growing pains)
Growing pains are just the part of livin'
(Woo-ooh-ooh, ooh)
This you got to realize (gotta realize)
Don't bothered by what was going
What's going wrong in your life
