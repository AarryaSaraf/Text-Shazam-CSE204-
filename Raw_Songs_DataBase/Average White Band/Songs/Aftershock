Wo, wo, wo, wo-ah

Never, never should've let you go
Something got a hold of me
Sun don't shine, grass won't grow
Is this my reality?

I miss your flamin' red glasses
I miss your faded blue jeans
Baby, no warning
I break up this morning
Fallin' apart at the seams

Sufferin' from a
Aftershock
Ooh, I love you baby
And I just can't rub

See you get the world to do it
Who knows for
Look out, here comes another
Aftershock

Tellin' tale, what did I do wrong?
Can't you forgive and forget?
Never thought a day could be so long
Guess I ain't seen nothing yet

I miss your flamin' red glasses
I miss your faded blue jeans
Gone is the touch that I needed so much
All I've got left is the dreams

Sufferin' from a
Aftershock
Ooh, I love you baby
And I just can't rub

See you get the world to do it
Who knows for
Look out, here comes another
Aftershock

I wanna see our love
Get back on solid ground
Don't want to stand and watch
The world's now crumbling down, alright, hey, hey

Run to sunset boulevard
Girl, you're now sittin' right next to me
Knock the earth with your foot down hard
Make a living of history

Sufferin' from a
Aftershock
Ooh, I love you baby
And I just can't rub

See you get the world to do it
Who knows for
Look out, here comes another
Aftershock

I'm sufferin' from a
Aftershock
Ooh, I love you baby
And I just can't rub

See you get the world to do it
Just about who knows for
Look out, here comes another
Aftershock

Stuck in a holy wood
Aftershock
Ooh, I love you baby
And I just can't rub

See you get the world to do it
Who knows for
Look out, here comes another
Aftershock
