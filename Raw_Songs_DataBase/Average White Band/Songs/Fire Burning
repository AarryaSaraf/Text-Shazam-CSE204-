Keep the fire burning
Till I get back home to you
I'll keep the wheels turning...

When I'm away from you, baby
I'm running on half my speed
So I've got to know
At the end of the line
You will be waiting for me

Keep the fire burning
Till I get back home to you
I'll keep the wheels turning...

When I'm away from you
The road may be long and tough
But what I want you to do
I guess you know it too
Is keep the flame hot enough

Keep the fire burning
Till I get back home to you
I'll keep the wheels turning...
