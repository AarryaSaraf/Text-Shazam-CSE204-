Hey, (look at) those big city lights
They won't shine tonight for me
It's raining, I'm walking the streets
My heart is way down, down in my shoes
Talking, talking to myself
There's nobody else who can hear me

Your love put me on the corner
When I came back and found you were gone
Tonight I feel the city won't
Let me come home

Hey, (look at) those big city lights
They used to be so friendly to me
I came to New York to make it our home
Now you've gone and left me here, here on my own
East side, West side, who's on my side
If I could find where you are I might know

Laughing and drinking
With bad weather friends

Makes me forget for a while
But every time I drain my glass
All I can see is your smile

Hey, (look at) those big city lights
Buildings closing in on me
Hey, (look at) those big city lights
Only make it harder to see

I can't believe you really left me
All this time you said I was your man
But I'm gonna find you
And I know that I can
Know that I can

Hey
Tell me what about those big city lights
