Put it where you want it
That won't take much time
We can make the best of it and I could make you mine
Put it where you want it
Bring your love over here (bring it here)
One thing that I'm sure of, honey, mine won't disappear

Put it where you want it
Lay it on the line, (lay it down) you can share your love around
And I can share my time (can't share with nobody)
Put it where you want it, well that ain't hard to do
One man has to win your love, one of us has got to lose

I've been searching the whole wide world
But love like yours is so hard to find
Put it where you want it
Put it where you want it
Put it where you want it
Put it where you want it, I just want you to know

Put it where you want it
That won't take much time
We can make the best of it and I could make you mine
Put it where you want it
Bring your love over here (bring it to me, bring it to me)
One thing that I'm sure of honey, mine won't disappear

I guess there must be a thousand guys who want you
But I'm the one who wants you the most
Put it where you want it...
