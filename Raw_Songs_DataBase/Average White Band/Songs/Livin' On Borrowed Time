Girl, I can't believe it comes to this already
We turned back the hands of time
Always tried to give you love and be real steady
But something else is on your mind
The things you do, the words you say, to keep me guessing
But I just can't give up the fight, no
Sometimes you have to lose a lot to learn a lesson
It's not to late to so what's right

Because we're livin' on borrowed time
Livin' on borrowed time with you
Livin' on borrowed time, ah...
Livin' on borrowed time
Livin' on borrowed time with you
Livin' on borrowed time, ah...

Don't you know that life's too short to second guessing
One last chance to do 
So make up your mind 

And now we're livin' on borrowed time
Livin' on borrowed time with you
Livin' on borrowed time, ah...
Livin' on borrowed time
Livin' on borrowed time with you
Livin' on borrowed time, ah...
...
