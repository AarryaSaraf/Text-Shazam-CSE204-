When I hear you call my name
So soft and low
I get to feel so good
Way down inside of me
You could have had the choice
Of anyone you want
I can't understand why you're here
Right here beside me now, oh baby

It's a mystery
What you see in me
I know I got to
Keep on seeing you
It's a mystery
What you see in me

When I speak to you
Over the telephone
I just want to be right there
Beside you, girl
Cause holding you and loving you
Is on my mind
I'm so glad, I'm so glad
You feel the same way too
