Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
I

Imagine no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine the people
Living life in peace
You

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll come and join us
And the world will be one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of men
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You

You, you, you may say I'm a dreamer
Oh, God knows that I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll come and join us
And the world will live as one

Imagine
A world of peace, imagine
No greed but harmony, imagine
Just sit down and think about it
We can live in harmony
If you just sit down and think about it

Imagine
Living in a world of peace
Sit down and think about it
Living in a world of peace
Use your imagination
