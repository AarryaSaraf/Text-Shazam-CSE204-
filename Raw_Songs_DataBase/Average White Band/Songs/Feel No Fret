My friend, my good friend
Don't you look so sad
I know that you've been cheated
That's bad, so bad
But time is too precious
Why don't you put on that smile
Forget about loneliness
If you occupy your time
Then pretty soon you'll

Feel no fret
Be no weeping no wailing
Feel no fret
Be no meaning no groaning
Feel no fret
Nothing new that you're owning

My friend, my good friend
Dry your weeping eyes
Handle it with courage
If you hold your head up high
Then pretty soon you'll

Feel no fret
Be no weeping no wailing
Feel no fret
Be no moaning no groaning
Feel no fret
Nothing new that you're owning
Feel no fret

My friend, my good friend
It's an all time low
But you can see right through it
If you hang in tight
Then pretty soon you'll

Feel no fret
Be no weeping and wailing
Feel no fret
Be no moaning no groaning
Feel no fret
Nothing new that you're owning
Feel no fret
