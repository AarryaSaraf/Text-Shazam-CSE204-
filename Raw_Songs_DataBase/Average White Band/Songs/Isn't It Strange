(Ahh) ehh
(Ahh) ehh

If ever I lose my way
Will you be there to see me, oh?
To tackle this thing, oh no
Would be too much
For a man who showed her

Please, don't understand
That's not the way that it's supposed to happen, no

Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?
If I'ver get your ten, girl
Let you know it by heart
Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?
What love imparts
(What love imparts)

If ever I lose my place
Will you be there to turn the page?
Regardless of what it takes
I will be there for the final after

Please, don't run away (don't you run away)
Don't be afraid of what the future's holding, no

Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?
If I'ver get your ten, girl
Let you know it by heart
Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?
What love imparts
(What love imparts)

(You don't want to face it, no) oh woah
(You're the frequent place it, woah)
(You don't want to face it, no)

(You, don't you run away)
Don't be afraid of what the future's holding, no

Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?
If I'ver get your ten, girl
Let you know it by heart
Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?
What love imparts
(What love imparts)

Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?
If I'ver get your ten, girl
Ah, got you know it by heart
Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny?
(What love imparts) ooh-ooh
