Sometimes I had to wonder
What we did before you came
Back then life was classified
In different shades of grey

Oh there was so much resistance
To the dreams of a brand new day
We didn't learn to listen
Until you had your say

Don't be afraid of what is right
Just take a step into the light
And when you open up your eyes

You're living in colour
One another
Whether you're black or white or blue
You're living in colour
Oh brother
That's all we have to do

Back there in the shadows
Seemed the safest place to be
Wheels were turning, fires were burning
They were marching in a street

Oh, you had a different vision
Of the way this world should be
Something I've been missing
Until you said to me

Don't be afraid to speak your mind
It come up from behind
Don't you now that it's time

For living in colour
One another
Whether you're black or white or blue
You're living in colour
Oh my brother
That's all we have to do

Living in colour
It's taken
More than a lifetime on the way
Living in colour
No mistaken
That's what I heard you say

Don't be afraid of what is right
Take a step into the light
Don't be afraid to speak your mind
Don't you know that it's time

For living in colour
One another
Whether you're black or white or blue
You're living in colour
Oh my brother
That's all we have to do

Living in colour
It's taken
More than a lifetime on the way
Living in colour
No mistaken
That's what I heard you say

Living in colour
One another
Whether you're black or white or blue
You're living in colour
Oh my brother
That's all we have to do

Living in colour
It's taken
More than a lifetime on the way
Living in colour
No mistaken
That's what I heard you say
