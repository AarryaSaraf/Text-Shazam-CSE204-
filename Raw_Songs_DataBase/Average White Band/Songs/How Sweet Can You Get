You git a way about you, lady
You can charm the birds right out of the trees with your sweetness
Maybe if I stayed around you long enough
I might find how good this thing could be

Can you get sweeter than sugar
Can you get sweeter than wine
Can you get sweeter than perfume
Can you get sweeter than sunshine

How sweet can you get
Oh baby, how sweet can you get
How sweet can you get
Just how sweet can you get
How sweet can you get, how sweet

Ooh when you smile at me the clouds all disappear
You are warmer than a sunny sunny day in L.A. baby
Still it seems too perfect and I really got to know
That is why I got one question for you
And I just gotta say

Can you get sweeter than honey
Can you get sweeter than wine
Can you get sweeter than roses
Can you get sweeter than sunshine

Something kinda tells me
That the best is yet to come

How sweet can you get
How sweet can you get
...
