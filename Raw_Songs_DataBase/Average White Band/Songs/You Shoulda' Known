Heard you doubt my love but you know me, you should know better
I belong to you, only you
Girl you got to know if it's up to me we'll be together
For ever and ever

When another girl even looks my way
I let her know that she best be on her way
Don't want to spend my time, don't want to give my love
To no one but you

Girl you shoulda' known, I'll never let you down
Your heart is my home, you're always on my mind
Girl you shoulda' known, this love is on solid ground
You shoulda' known by the look in my eye
You shoulda' known, shoulda' known baby
You shoulda' known, shoulda' known baby

How could you doubt my love, you know me, you should know better
Darlin' I'd be a fool to lose your trust
Ain't nothin' in my life, in this whole world I've come to treasure
The way I do you

So any time that you feel unsure
Look in my eyes that's where you'll find the truth
I wanna fill you up with all the love I feel
And take your worries away

Girl you shoulda' known, I'll never let you down
Your heart is my home, you're always on my mind
Girl you shoulda' known, this love is on solid ground
You shoulda' known by the look in my eye

And when I met you I had a feelin' that we were meant to be
And you were meant just for me
And I'm holding on to what I've found in you...

Shoulda' known...
