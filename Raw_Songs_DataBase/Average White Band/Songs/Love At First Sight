I felt love when I walked into the room
Could it be
Love at first sight
I felt love, I'm not easily fooled
I know (I know)
It's love at first sight

There was a certain look
From across the room
I knew I had to have you
Was this a feeling sign
You must know
I see that look in your eyes

The closer we get
Each beat of my heart
Keeps getting faster
This love you made me feel
Must be real
'Cause nothing else matters

I felt love when I walked into the room (I felt love)
Could it be
Love at first sight (Love at first sight)
I felt love, I'm not easily fooled
I know (I know)
It's love at first sight
Tonight

Girl won't you take a chance
On a new romance
I won't be too demanding
I'll give my heart to you
And all of my love
So please don't misunderstand me
Now (now) now that I felt your love (love)
What a special feeling
Now (now) now that I have your love (love)
Well girl I'll never leave you

I felt love when I walked into the room (I felt love)
Could it be (Could it be)
Love at first sight (Love at first sight)
I felt love, I'm not easily fooled
I know (I know)
It's love at first sight

I felt love when I walked into the room
Could it be
Love at first sight (It was love at first sight)
I felt love, I'm not easily fooled
I know (I know)
Girl I'll never leave you
Girl I'll never, never leave you
No I'll never leave you

I felt love when I walked into the room
Could it be
Love at first sight (Love)
I felt love, I'm not easily fooled
I know (I know)
It's love at first sight
Tonight

I felt love when I walked into the room
Could it be
Love at first sight (Love at first sight)
I felt love, I'm not easily fooled
I know (I know, I know)
It's love at first sight

I felt love when I walked into the room
Could it be
