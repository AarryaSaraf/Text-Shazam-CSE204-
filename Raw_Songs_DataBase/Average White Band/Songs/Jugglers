It might be my imagination
But I can feel the spirit moving up on me
I get the creepin', when I should be sleeping
And the music isn't like it use to be
What am I gonna to do about it sister
How am I to take the strain
What am I gonna do about it sister, yeah
The needle brings it all back again
I had a word with the Joker my friend
Here's a game that you might like to play
We call it running business and then, blow the opposition all away
You do it
What am I gonna do about it sister
How am I to take the strain
What am I gonna do about it sister, yeah
The needle brings it all back again
How am I to get by, well I can't even try

How am I to get through, don't know what I'm gonna do
You might be afraid when the Jugglers in town
That's because they try to see my face
But they got a shock, on what I'm putting down
There'll be Jugglers lying all over the place
What am I gonna do about it sister
How am I to take the strain
What am I gonna do about it sister, yeah
The needle brings it all back again
What am I gonna do
I'm asking you, what am I gonna do
Play on it
Play on it
Play on it...
Don't let it get you down, down
Don't let it get you down, down
