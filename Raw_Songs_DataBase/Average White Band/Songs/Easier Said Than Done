Honey don't act that way
I think you better look before you leave
I'm not trying to make you stay
But the water may be too deep

Remember I walked after a fight
It was hard to get along, the feeling got to strong
But it was harder to stay away
When I toss and turn all night and I think of you all day

I stay out every night to find another
But it's easier said than done
Trying hard to find another to match up to my lover
But it's easier said than done
Trying hard to find another to match up to my lover
But it's easier said than done
To stay away

Maybe it's your turn
You think the flame in your heart has burnt out
But there's a lesson to be learned
You better stay out than put oneself down

Forgive me for what I said
I came down on you like a wave in the ocean
I'm back to you once more
And I wanna give to you all my love and devotion

I stay out every night to find another
But it's easier said than done
Trying hard to find another to match up to my lover
But it's easier said than done

If you still wanna go
Then I said all that I can say
But there's one thing you should know
When you're alone you see things in a different way

Life is much too lonely you need your one and only
But it's easier said than done
Trying hard to find another to match up to my lover
But it's easier said than done

Life is much too lonely you need your one and only
But it's easier said than done (Easier said than done)
Trying hard to find another to match up to my lover
But it's easier said than done (Easier)

Life is much too lonely you need your one and only
But it's easier said than done
