Driving down the magazines
I don't know just where I'll be
Heading for the Bong-Tong, the new lake
There's a town sitting next to me
Looks fine but then she ought to be
A little too much whiskey on the way, a-ha

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen
Oh yeah let it shine

I'm walking east on Ramp-out Street
I can't stop my feet
Heading for the sound of the trumpet

There's coming at these rythm kings
To getting on with that fame
Of uncle Joe's 'cause it caught on the cafeine
That's right y'all

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty, so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen
Shine awhile y'all

Let it shine

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen

Another delta night is gone
Walking through the dawn
Heading for some coffee and beignet

Some ghosts are walking next to me
Blue with, but the end of their teeth
I guess I got some company today, oh yeah

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen
Yeah

Don't drop it now
Don't drop it now

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen
One more time

Half moon in the crescent city
Hot nights down in New Orleans
Half moon hang in there so pretty, so pretty
Let it shine on the mississippi queen
Don't you dare to be alone
Oh yeah

Oh that's one at a time
Down to Queen-be street
Who knows who you're gonna meet
All night long

Up they stay
At the Bong-Tong blue lake
They're gonna dance their mourn away
Ooh
I will stay here a while
