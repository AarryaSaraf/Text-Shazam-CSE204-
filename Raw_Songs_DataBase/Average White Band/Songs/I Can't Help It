When we were finding what it means to be in love
The passion ruled out any reason
We should have known there was no sanction from above
But Cupid never had a feel of treason

I never doubted time and distance would decide
What set of rules that we would live by
But all the years and all our differences aside
And there was love nobody could deny

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (still in love, girl)
And despite the things we put each other through (all little the things you do)
Little memories are far between and few (oh yeah, yeah)
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Yeah, there were days when the silence was so loud
It seemed we dined on our emotions
And it was clear that we would never be allowed
To find a haven from that raging ocean

No one can help us with all their good advice
We had to stand and watch it go by
Put all our tears and all our suffering aside
And there was love nobody could deny

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (still in love with you, yeah)
And despite the things we put each other through (all the little things we did)
Little memories are far between and few
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Tell me
Still in love with you
No matter what you do
I'll be watching over you
Still in love with, still in love with you
Even if you're out there having fun with someone else

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (I can't help it, girl)
And despite the things we put each other through (despite the thing we did, girl)
Little memories are far between and few (far between and few, yeah)
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (still in love, still in love)

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (oh no, no)
And despite the things we put each other through (all the little things we did, yeah)
Little memories are far between and few (far between and few, yeah)
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (I can't help it, oh no this feeling girl)
And despite the things we put each other through (despite the things we put each other through)
Little memories are far between and few (oh yeah they are, oh yeah they are)
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
