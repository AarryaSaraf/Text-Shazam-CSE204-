Hey little beauty
Why you act so shy?
Must have put an arrow on the string
Oh my little cutie, lift your eyes up off the ground
Can't you that feel love is on the wing?

(Just let yourself go)
Let down your guard, 'cause I got you in my sight
(You wanna know)
You are the one that I really prized

Cupid's in fashion
Love is never out of style
Cupid's in fashion
Cupid's in fashion
It is still the latest thing
Cupid's in fashion
(Yeah-yeah-woo)

Hey little cupid
Make sure your aim is true
I can't afford to let this chance go by
(Uh, uh)
And I can feel the quiver
Won't you make a feeling too?
Now's a time to let your arrow fly

(Straight to her heart)
The heart of the matter
Is the apple of my eye
(Right from the start)
You are the one that I really prize

Cupid's in fashion
Love is never out of style
Cupid's in fashion
(Oh, yeah)
Cupid's in fashion
It is still the greatest thing
(Still the greatest thing)
Cupid's in fashion

Hey, hey, hey

Cupid's in fashion
Love is never out of style
(Never out of style)
Cupid's in fashion
(Oh, yeah)
Cupid's in fashion
It is still the greatest thing
(Still the greatest thing)
Cupid's in fashion
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)

Cupid's in fashion
Love is never out of style
Cupid's in fashion

Cupid's in fashion
It is still the latest thing
(Still the greatest thing)
Cupid's in fashion

Cupid's in fashion
Love is never out of style
Cupid's in fashion
