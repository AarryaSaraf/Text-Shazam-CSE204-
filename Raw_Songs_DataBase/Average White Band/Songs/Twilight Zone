Don't it feel bad
When your woman is mad that you don't come home
And you try to pretend that it doesn't affect you
Still you wait by the phone

And you're caught in a twilight zone
Nothing that you can do
Caught in a twilight zone
It's great it happen

Something is wrong, she's been gone so long
I wonder where can she be
And you stop to imagine
About the bone left stucken
And if it still become much stronger than me

And you're caught in a twilight zone
Love is just standing still
Caught in a twilight zone
But you never quit

How I wish that I could hear her key in the door
Yeah that would please me
Jump at every sound, every scrape at the floor
Just try to tease me

Well I wanna let you
I'm gonna let you know
Somethings have just got to change
Well I wanna let you
I'm gonna let you know
These things got to be talked about
Plans to re-arrange

Bad as it seems
This must be something I can raise above
Because it comes to each and everyone
Rich or poor, every mother son
Whoever fell in love

And you're caught in a twilight zone
Nothing that you can do
Caught in a twilight zone
It's great it happen

How I wish that I could hear her key in the door
Yeah that would please me, hmm
Jump at every sound, every scrape at the floor
Just try to tease me

But I wanna let you
I'm gonna let you know
Somethings have just got to change
Well I wanna let you
I'm gonna let you know
These things got to be talked about
Plans to re-arrange

And you're caught in a twilight zone
That is just bad at scale
Caught in a twilight zone
It's great it happen

Hey (I know) oh yeah, yeah
