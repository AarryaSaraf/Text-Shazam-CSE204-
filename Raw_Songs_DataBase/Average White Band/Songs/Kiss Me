Do-do-do-do-do-do
Yes, I'm standing here
You look so delicious

Oh, I want to taste them now
Don't deny my wishes
Come on, start over here
Look me straight in the eye

Bucker up, baby, let's you and me fly
Oh, oh
Kiss me, give me some honey

Kiss me
But it ain't
Kiss me now

Right now
Looky, looky, looky with those precious eyes
Taking with my pressure

Oh, you got to give it up
Foolin' ain't my fashion
Compose to me now
You know it's alright

Cuddle up to me real soon with pride
Wooh-ooh
Kiss me, give me some honey

Kiss me
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Kiss me now

Right now
Right now
Kiss, kiss

Kiss me now
Right now

Oh-oh-oh-ooh

Now, wow
Oh, right now, baby
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss

Do-do-do-do-do-do
Yes, I'm living breathe
You look so delicious
Oh, I'm gonna ask you one more time
Don't deny my wishes
Hold on to me now
Give it a try

Bucker up, baby, let's you and me fly
Oh, oh
Kiss me, give me some honey

Kiss me
I want to do
Kiss me now

Right now
Right now
Now, now, now

Oh, oh
Kiss me now
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Kiss me now, now

You know, you look so delicious
You know, you look so delicious
Delicious, delicious

Kiss me now
Oooh-oooh

Stop denying my wishes
Stop denying my wishes, ooh-oooh

You know what, you know what
You know, know, know
Kiss me now
