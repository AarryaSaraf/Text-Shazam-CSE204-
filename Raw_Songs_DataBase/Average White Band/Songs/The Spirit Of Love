Do what you do, I just can't get enough
Take it from me in the spirit of love

People say that it's the spirit of adventure
That keeps me here by your side
Drifting in and out of love the way that we do
Me and you, girl

They don't know about the things that we get up to
To keep our love in a line
Who could ever try to tame a spirit like you
I don't know

Just when I think I know you better
You turn and change your mind
But you don't even think about yourself
So why should I be so inclined

Do me right, do your stuff
Do anything that you're thinking of
Treat me nice, play it rough
As long as you do it in the spirit of love
Do it in the spirit, baby

People say that we're too crazy for each other
But I don't see it that way
They don't know about the spirit the way that we do
Me and you, girl

If anyone can do it better
Then let him speak his mind
But we don't need anybody's help, girl
I know we'll do just fine

Do me right, do your stuff
Do anything that you're thinking of
Treat me nice, play it rough
As long as you do it in the spirit of love

Do me right, do your stuff
Do anything that you're thinking of
Treat me nice, play it rough
As long as you do it in the spirit of love
In the spirit of love

Do what you do, I just can't get enough
Take it from me in the spirit of love
Do what you do, I just can't get enough
Take it from me in the spirit of love

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Do me right, do your stuff
Do anything that you're thinking of
Treat me nice, play it rough
As long as you do it in the spirit of love

Do me right, do your stuff
Do anything that you're capable of
Treat me nice, play it rough
As long as you do it in the spirit of love
