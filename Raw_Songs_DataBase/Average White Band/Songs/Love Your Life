I believe there's no place for despair
Sometimes your heart is heavy, beware
If you feel that you're ready to give up, keep on
Don't have to live up to what others expect of you
There's something new in every situation
So much to laugh about, so much to enjoy
The power of love
Help from above will only come
If we help ourselves
Wanna tell you

Love your life, give it all you got
Love your life, it's a blessing
Love your life
Love your life
Love your life (life) it's a blessing
Don't heed nobody, no, no

When I get down, feel like I wanna quit
I believe I got the strength to handle it
Make every moment big as it can be
There is only one thing to do
So you got to

Love your life, give it all you got
Love your life, it's a blessing
Love your life
Love your life
Love your life it's a blessing
Don't heed nobody, no, no

Love your life, yeah
Love your life, love your life right
Love your life, yeah, yeah
You gotta love your life
