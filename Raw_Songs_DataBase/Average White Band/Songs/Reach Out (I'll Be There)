Now, if you feel that you can't go on
Because all of your hope is gone
And your life is filled with much confusion
Until happiness is just an illusion
And your world is crumblin' down

Darling, reach out
Reach out (reach out for me, reach out for me)
I'll be there, with a love that will shelter you
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through
I'll be there

When you feel lost and about to give up
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're drifting out all on your own
And you need a hand to hold

Darling, reach out
Reach out (reach out for me, reach out for me)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you
I'll be there, to cherish and care for you
I'll be there, oh-oh

You feel that you can't no more
Reach out to me

Oh, I can tell the way you hang your head
That you're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found
You're alone, no love of your own

Darling, reach out, oh, oh
Reach out (reach out for me, reach out for me)
I'll be there, to love and cherish you
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through (with a love that will see you through)
I'll be there
