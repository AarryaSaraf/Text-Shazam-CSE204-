Baby I know
I heard it through
I heard I through
I heard it through
Said, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh baby
I bet you're wondering, how I knew
About your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys, you know love you more
You took me by surprise
When I heard you just met yesterday
Don't you know heard it through the grapevine
Not that sure you'll be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And honey, I'm about to lose my mind
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
Ooh you know a man ain't suppose to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see

Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you've gone and found someone else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine, that no longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine, honey I'm just about to lose my mind
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be, my baby
People say they hide from what you see
So, in love with what you hear
I've been hurt I've been confused
But if it's true, won't you tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For another guy who says he loves you more
'Cause I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine, and honey I'm just about to lose my mind
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be, my baby
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be, my baby
I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be, my baby
