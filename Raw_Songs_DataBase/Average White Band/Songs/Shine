Nothing in this world
Seems to function without heart
You oughta know
There's no need to pull yourself apart
Nothing you can do
Seems to matter without love
Don't be afraid
Everything you've got will be enough

All the things you are
Could stay locked up inside
Far from the light of day
It's much more than a matter of pride
Can't you hear them saying

Shine...
Let it be a light that burns within
Open up and
Shine...
Never mind the darkness closing in
You can rise above and
Shine...
Just close your eyes and shine

Whatever you may do
Don't forget about the little things
Small as they may seem
You oughta know
They all add up to someone else's dreams
Whatever you may think
No ones gonna be the the way
You can be the one
It's up to you
There's no better time to call the play

All the things you are
Will stay with you wherever you may go
No use in trying to hide
It's much more than a matter of show
You must be alive

Shine...
Let it be a light that burns within
Open up and
Shine...
Never mind the darkness closing in
You can rise above and
Shine...
Just close your eyes and shine
...
