Please don't fall in love
Leave the words unspoken
'Cause if you do you know
Your heart will get broken

Love is a plain and simple
Game for fools
What makes you think
You can change all the rules
But my advice to you
Is to look around
Don't even think twice about
This loving thing you've found

You talk about love as if
It's a matter of fact
Love deals the kind of hand
That's bound to bite you back
If you feel sure enough
Then that's all right
But when the doubt creeps in
You've got to let it slide

Please don't fall in love
Leave the words unspoken
'Cause if you do you know
Your heart will get broken
Please don't fall in love
Unless you're truly certain
'Cause if you do you know
You're gonna be hurting
