I could fly
But tonight I'm not an angel
Only music can take me so high
Oh yeah
From the moment I heard the beat
There was fire under my feet
And you were passing by

And you've got the fever, fast and strong
Didn't care for the second song now
I know where to find what you want

Check your groove at the door
Come and meet me on the floor
Tell the DJ, that we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Fell the rhythm slip and slide
Let me show you the beat that you've been missing

I could lie
But you know there's nothing better
Funky music never runs out of time
From the minute I heard the groove
There was something making me move
Couldn't let it pass me by

And you've got the message, loud and clear
But didn't want me to disappear
I know where to take it from here baby, yeah

Check your groove at the door
Come and meet me on the floor
Tell the DJ, that we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Let the rhythm slip and slide
Let me show you the beat that you've been missing

You've got the fire
You've got the fever, baby

Check your groove at the door
Come and meet me on the floor
Tell the DJ, that we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Let the rhythm slip and slide
Let me show you the beat that you've been missing
Check your groove at the door
Tell the DJ, we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Let me show you the beat that you've been missing
Check your groove at the door

Check your groove at the door
Come and meet me on the floor
Tell the DJ, that we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Feel the rhythm slip and slide
Let me show you the beat that you've been missing

Check your groove at the door
Come and meet me on the floor
Tell the DJ, that we don't need to listen
Leave you vibe on the side
Feel the rhythm slip and slide
Let me show you
