Stand up
Don't let the people get you down
Play some funky music, get dancin'
Better than hangin' around
You got to fight, fight
The blues ain't strong enough to beat you
Come on out tonight, don't need money
I'll be there to meet you

'Cause I believe I can make you
A high flyin' woman again
Forget about the past
You'll never see that man again

Time was
We were just like sister and brother
But you got hung on him, all the time
He treated you like the others
Hey now
He's gone from your life, let's celebrate
Put on these high-heeled shoes, paint your face
Got no time to waste

'Cause I believe I can make you
A high flyin' woman again
Forget about the past
You'll never see that man again

Hey, hey, gonna make you a high-steppin' chicken again
Hey, hey, come on baby, come on out tonight
'Cause I believe I can make you
A high flyin' woman again
Forget about the past
You'll never see that man again
'Cause I believe I can make you
A high flyin' woman again
