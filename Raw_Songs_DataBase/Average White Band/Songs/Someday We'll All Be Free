Hang on to the world as it spins around
Just don't let the spin get you down
Things are moving fast
Hold on tight and you will last

Give yourself respect, your manly pride
Get yourself in gear
Keep your stride
Never mind your fears

Brighter days will soon be here
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free

Keep on walking tall
Hold your head up high
Lay your dreams right up to the sky
Sing your greatest songs
And you'll keep growing, growing on

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free
Just wait and see, some day we'll all be free
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free

Take it from me
Take it from me
Just wait and see, someday we'll all be free
(Just wait and see)
All you have to do is wait and see
Wait and see

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free
Take it from me, oh, oh
Just wait and see, someday we'll all be free
(One day we'll all be free, just wait and see)

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free (take it from me)
(Take it from me)
Just wait and see, someday
One day, we will all
We will all be, we will all be free, free
(We'll all be free)
(We'll all be free)
