It's too late to cry
Too late for wondering why
You got to dry your eyes
Baby, it's too late to cry

You always told me
It was no good, no good
I never treated you the way
That I ought to do
I was an easy target
Too blind to see my weakness
I did you wrong, I know
But you couldn't really see my side
I know you didn't understand

Now it's too late to cry
Too late for wondering why
You got to dry your eyes
Baby, it's too late to cry

We had those good times
Some that were so bad, so bad
We couldn't hold what we had
At the start
It's too late to cry
The feeling is gone now, gone now
Gets so bad sometimes
It's hard to stop from breaking down
And you wonder if you really tried

Now it's too late to cry
Too late for wondering why
Yes it's too late to cry
Wondering just what passed you by
Baby, it's too late to cry
Gotta dry your eyes
