(All right)
I never knew what I was missing in love
For each time I had it right
And like a spirit that was sent from above
You are a new, inspiring light

Wanted to show me
Alone I couldn't find
The answer to these questions
Was with you all the time
And baby I know this
Is what I'm looking for
There's only one way
We can now for sure

Let's go all the way
All the way 'cause
Heaven's not so far away
For you and I
Let's go all the way
Come with me, together
We will find a way
So, let's go all the way

To satisfy love's greatest demands
Wherever they might lead us to
Make this feeling last as older we can
I wouldn't be here without you

Wherever we're going
I'll be by your side
There'll be no more questions
And nothing left to hide
Baby I know this (I know)
Is what I'm looking for
And what I'm up for it is so much more

Let's go all the way
All the way 'cause
Heaven's not so far away
For you and I
Let's go all the way
Come with me, together
We will find a way
So, let's go baby

All the way
All the way 'cause
Heaven's just a breath away
For you and I
We'll go all the way
Come with me, together
We will find a way
So, let's go all the way
All of the way (oh baby)
(Stick to living)

Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me please

Let's go all the way
All the way 'cause
Heaven's not so far away (not so far away)
For you and I
We'll go all the way
Come with me, together
We will find a way
Let's go (let's go)

Let's go all the way
All the way 'cause
Heaven's just a breath away (just a breath away)
For you and I
We'll go all of the way, baby
Come with me, together
We will find a way
So, let's go all the way

Oh baby let's go all the way
All the way
Let's go all the way
