Make me laugh, make me cry
You don't have to give a lot to me
When I don't really know you are gone
He was weak, you were strong
Or do I have it all completely wrong
Is there a little bit more than you like to say?
Something else that pulled you away
And I've got to ask sometime

Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Is it love that you're running from?
Do you think I can help?
Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Is it love that you're running from?
Come to me girl, I can surely help

What's the cost? What the cure?
I must say I'm not entirely sure
It's not another case of those well-fed blues
Come inside, lock the door
Even if you've said it all before
We might put something new in that same old line
Something that you're trying to find
And you've got to start somewhere

Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Is it love that you're running from
Do you think I can help?

Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Is it love that your running from or?
Girl, I gave you some help

Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Would you want it woman?
Is it love that you're running from?
Let me give you some help, yeah
Let me help you

Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Is it love that you're running from or?
Do you think that I can be some help?
