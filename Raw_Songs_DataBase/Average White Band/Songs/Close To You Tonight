Another hotel window
And the night is closing in
I should be anticipating
What tonight in the city will bring
All these places that I get to see (all the places)
Now they all look the same to me

I wanna be close, baby
(By your side as you're turning out the lights) turning out the lights
(What to do with the love that burns inside)
Oh, the love that burns inside of me, baby
(I just wanna be close to you tonight)

There's a train out at midnight
But that's a fantasy I know
So I hold on for another day
Every night a different show
All these faces are waiting for me (all these faces)
They don't know where I'd rather be

Closer tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah
(By your side as you're turning out the lights)
Turning, turning out the lights, baby
(What to do with the love that burns inside)
Oh, with the love that burns inside
(I just wanna be close to you tonight) oh

I can't wait for this lonely road to end, oh baby
So many miles that I have to go
Before I'm in your arms again

I just wanna be close to you, girl
(By your side as you're turning out the lights)
Oh, turning out the lights, yeah
(What to do with the love that burns inside)
Oh, this love, girl, burning inside of me
(I just wanna be close to you tonight)
I just wanna be, wanna be, yeah

I, yeah, I need to be with you
(By your side as you're turning out the lights)
By your side, baby, yeah
(What to do with the love that burns inside)
Oh that burns inside, yeah, that burns inside, yeah
(I just wanna be close to you tonight)
