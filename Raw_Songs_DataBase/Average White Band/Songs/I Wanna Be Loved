(Oh yeah...)

What exactly are you thinking
Let me begin to ease your mind
Whatever the devil pays, for left handed ways
You got to know I'm dealing for my life, ooh yeah
save your love for a minute
Keep all your thoughts on the line
I couldn't begin to live for another day
I wouldn't die for the chance to make you mine

I wanna be loved, ooh yeah
I wanna be, wanna be loved by you
Ooh, I wanna be loved, oh darling
I wanna be loved by you, oh yeah

All the habits of a lifetime
I've been trying hard to make them history
I'm thinking if we got to smooth out the rough spots baby
Say girl "You'd get the best of me"

I wanna be loved, ooh yeah
I wanna be, wanna be loved by you
Ooh, I wanna be loved, oh darling
I wanna be loved by you, oh yeah

Girl if you're with me
You've got to forgive all my past

I wanna be loved...
