If you know what's right for you
I know what's right for me
I won't tell you what to do
But I'll tell you what I see
We gotta change the way it is
Try to keep it tight
Acting just like strangers
Surely can't be right

It's got to be warmer
We got to have warmer, warmer, warmer
Warmer communications

Trying hard to touch you
If I might be so bold
Trying hard to reach you
Don't put me on hold

If we can't communicate
If we don't even try
Standing here like losers
The world will pass us by

It's got to be warmer
We got to have warmer, warmer, warmer
Warmer communications

Burrrr.. it's so cold
I can't feel you
Burrrr.. it's so cold
I can't reach you
