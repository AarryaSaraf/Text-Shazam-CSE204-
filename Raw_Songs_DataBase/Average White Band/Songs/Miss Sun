Listen to my story (You may never be the same)
A young man in his glory (He may never see her again, oh no)

Hey Miss Sun, what can I say?
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning finds you back in my arms
Back in my arms

If I could just remember (What she told me in her eyes)
Until I can remember (There I stand in this fool's disguise, yes I do)

Hey Miss Sun, what can I say?
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning finds you back in my arms
Back in my arms

A young man in his glory (A young man in his glory)
He may never see her again

Hey Miss Sun, what can I say?
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning finds you back in my arms
Back in my arms

Hey Miss Sun, what can I say?
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning finds you back in my arms
Back in my arms

It won't be long, no

Hey Miss Sun, what can I say?
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning finds you back in my arms
Back in my arms
