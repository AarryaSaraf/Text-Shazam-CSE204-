// Clean //

Clean
The cleanest I've been
An end to the tears
And the in-between years
And the troubles I've seen
Now that I'm clean
You know what I mean
I've broken my fall
Put an end to it all
I've changed my routine
Now I'm clean
I don't understand
What destiny's planned
I'm starting to grasp
What is in my own hands
I don't claim to know
Where my holiness goes
I just know that I like
What is starting to show
Sometimes
Clean
The cleanest I've been
An end to the tears
And the in-between years
And the troubles I've seen
Now that I'm clean
You know what I mean
I've broken my fall
Put an end to it all
I've changed my routine
Now I'm clean
As years go by
All the feelings inside
Twist and they turn
As they ride with the tide
I don't advise
And I don't criticise
I just know what I like
With my own eyes
Sometimes
Clean
The cleanest I've been
An end to the tears
And the in-between years
And the troubles I've seen
Now that I'm clean
You know what I mean
I've broken my fall
Put an end to it all
I've changed my routine
Now I'm clean
Sometimes

// Downpour //

My faith runs thinner than water
For every wish has a name and with every fear
There is someone somewhere who loved before, who hoped before.
Someone who cried ten thousand oceans,
And someone who bled out the evening in search of you,
They carried hope thick in their visions,
And they held you deep in their chest.
You said this would be nimble and painless,
I am sorry that's not what I have found.
Devil stay away from me.

// Flowers And Razorwire //

Neck deep we wallow and this floor catches lingering feet
By rope with heartbreak this is our happiest moment of all
We dream of flowers on the razorwire
And wake to the scent of our dead
We're sinking
And all of those times don't matter here
Remember my love
This is for the sinking and the strength of our wings
Be brave and bleed out the day
We left our body for the sky and ended up here
Listen to me, don't let them list your feet
Our love is real

// I Won't Let You Go //

I want to be the better me
That you deserve to finally see
The dullest blade sharpens the truth
That every day I'm losing you

I want to be the better me
That you deserve to finally see
The dullest blade sharpens the truth
That every day I'm losing you

There's no easy way to say
There's nothing left to say
There's no easy way to say
I destroy everything

Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope

I want to be the better me
That you deserve to finally see
The dullest blade sharpens the truth
That every day I'm losing you

I want to be the better me
That you deserve to finally see
The dullest blade sharpens the truth
That every day I'm losing you

There's no easy way to say
There's nothing left to say
There's no easy way to say
I destroy everything

There's no easy way to say
There's nothing left to say
There's no easy way to say
I destroy everything

Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope
Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope

Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope
Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope

I'm walking by the trees
To find the missing key
Living in fear of
Vulnerability

I'm walking by the trees
To find the missing key
Living in fear of
Vulnerability

Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope

// Jacob's Ladder //

To say that all of those words meant something
Would be to say that your petty wars killed everything
And I wonder if we ever had one of those moments
Because I can't count the times
I tried to cut away the dead, hoping to grow up again
How much I tried to kill the smiling boy
The burden of falling out of the womb
How much "not enough" I ever received
I will solve these dreams before I wake up this time
This loss weighs, it will always weigh

// Serial Killer //

I've tasted the thrill of the kill the thrill of my victims.
I'm crushing, destroying, a figure of speech.
My mind is lost eternally out of my reach, richard,
In you glass case, stand to be judged.
Written there all over your face, ted, a twelve year old.
Your body should rot in public for all the women you've killed.
Run for your life I'm the serial killer
I've come to bury you today
No family no funeral no rosaries for...
Slain on this hillside, my silent grave, that's where you lay.
Buried dead bodies behind.
Their last words are still etched so clearly into his mind.
Driven, possessed by will, a will that takes over
And drives him out for the kill.
Submit, submit to me now.
He screams out in anger, blood thirsty as you cower down.
It's time, he raises the blade.
You cry out to god, for your innocent life to be saved.
Run for your life I'm the serial killer
I've come for your life today
I'm the serial killer
I've come to bury you today
No family, no funeral, no rosaries for...
Slain on this hillside, my silent grave, that's where you lay.

// Sky //

The sky is falling around me.
You choke in the saturated bliss.
A sky so much bluer than mine.
Strangulation of your warm soul.
Your flesh weakens me.
Joyless under the falling sky,
Your sky seems so much bluer.
Buried in displeasure.
I sink up through the sky
Rising into the grave in my mind.
Fly your dove, kill your love.
Bleed for me.
A tear shed without sincerity.
Open your heart and bleed for me
I will never set your soul free.
A fossil of you tempter, only flesh of what was.
Ashes of your fallen dreams.
I look into your eyes and I can't recognize you
But your sky is so much bluer than mine.

// Tied To My Neck //

You told me nine times before and you said that her touch was not love all these years.
You said that she stole and lied and you said to be "brave like me".
And I couldn't believe when you said outlive, but I must come out and face the unwilling terms.
These eyes they are old and can only focus on the son that I was, the wrong that I was.
I tried to gape the teeth just so the water could fill my lungs.
And all this time I thought I was drowning and all this time she made me and you caged me and beat me.
These shackles reek of your cologne and manipulative phrases.
She is dying and I wish Hell upon you one thousand times a day.
I have her graft inside of me, she sewed this body and made these eyes.
She put them in my head and gave me life.
You gave me hate, greed, confusion and a shimmering blurred backhand of your affection.
She is dying and I have come to realize this.
He is breathing but should have stopped a long time ago.
I know his heart quit but I have no reason for him to give anything.
And she is dying and I have missed her life.
She gave everything to me, I have so much conscience tied to my neck.
I want to swim atop of this sea and give her all the love which has so diligently fallen under lock and key.
It was so uneven and the anchor that I have woven is weighing and pulling me down to the bottom of this ocean.
And I wish I could spread my wings far enough to stop this fall from grace but there is nothing I can do.

// Tremor //

In the dark of our longest nights, we fall apart
Waiting for our end before it begins, we fall apart

// Zodiac //

Emptiness has never been so comforting starving crawling extinction.
I don't exist, she said "I don't exist than why do all things change?"
Framework fall killing lies you once told me what I bleed is
What's left you stained hands empty again.
Why do all things change? why do all things change?
Why? Why?

Zodiac sepsis locusts crawl through my lungs.
You will suffer for their wish your angels are hung.

I have been drowning in my mind
Needing for something that I must find.
The sun cannot shine without the two
I am searching for the memories of you

Zodiac collect for your afterlife
The loneliest time in my life is when I am with you, zodiac

I have been drowning in my mind
Needing for something that I must find.
The sun cannot shine without the two
I am searching for the memories of you

Zodiac collect for your afterlife
The loneliest time in my life is when I am with you, zodiac
I never knew you
You left me alone to burn zodiac

Sepsis locusts lay on my tongue
Reveal all the crimes that I have done

Zodiac don't leave me alone again.
Please take me to a place with no more pain.
Zodiac take my life away.
