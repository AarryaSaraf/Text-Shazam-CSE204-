Barren plan to be a better man
Rots in abandoned fields
Idle hands inherit spoiled lands
Hungry become the pigs

We reap, we sow
We mourn who we were
Love what we lost
In the grave

Laying with lions to hide my grief
From the beast that never sleeps
Our tired hearts tear us apart
Searching for the key

We reap, we sow
We mourn who we were
Love what we lost
In the grave of youth

Reap what we sow

Barren plan to be a better man
Rots in abandoned fields
Idle hands inherit spoiled lands
Hungry become the pigs

We reap, we sow
We mourn who we were
Love what we lost
In the grave of...
We reap, we sow
