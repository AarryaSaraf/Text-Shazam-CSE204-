Pounds of flesh and pints of blood
Just won't ever be enough
To break our stare into the sun
And show us all how to love

Between you and me
Shines a light of disbelief

Tears of fear and seeds of doubt
We cannot reach beyond
To touch the face of fallen ones
Discerning needs from their wants

Between you and me
Shines a light of disbelief

Constant reminders
Our failures last forever

As years fall, the fear takes root

Growing constant reminders
Our failures last forever

As years fall the fear takes root
Forever

Pounds of flesh and pints of blood
Just won't ever be enough
To break our stare into the sun
And show us all how to love

Between you and me
Shines a light of disbelief

Tears of fear and seeds of doubt
We cannot reach beyond
To touch the face of fallen ones
Discerning needs from their wants

Between you and me
Shines a light of disbelief

Constant reminders
Our failures last forever

As years fall, the fear takes root

Growing constant reminders
Our failures last forever

As years fall the fear takes root
Forever

Failure forever
Failure forever
