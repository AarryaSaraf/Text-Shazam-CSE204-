You said it's not that you know it
You said it's all hysteria
You said it's not true knowledge
You said it's not that you know you're wrong

Spiteful destroyer
Lord of the liars
Cower to cowards
Ice age is coming

It's only salt inside you
You know it's only cauterized
You know it's slowly dying
You know you know it's dying

Spiteful destroyer
Lord of the liars
Cower to cowards
Ice age is coming

Goodbye liars
Goodbye cowards
Goodbye liars
Goodbye cowards
Go

We sat in sudden silence
We sat beneath your watching eye
You know we've not forgotten
You know you were unbound
