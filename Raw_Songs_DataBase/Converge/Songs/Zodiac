Emptiness has never been so comforting starving crawling extinction.
I don't exist, she said "I don't exist than why do all things change?"
Framework fall killing lies you once told me what I bleed is
What's left you stained hands empty again.
Why do all things change? why do all things change?
Why? Why?

Zodiac sepsis locusts crawl through my lungs.
You will suffer for their wish your angels are hung.

I have been drowning in my mind
Needing for something that I must find.
The sun cannot shine without the two
I am searching for the memories of you

Zodiac collect for your afterlife
The loneliest time in my life is when I am with you, zodiac

I have been drowning in my mind
Needing for something that I must find.
The sun cannot shine without the two
I am searching for the memories of you

Zodiac collect for your afterlife
The loneliest time in my life is when I am with you, zodiac
I never knew you
You left me alone to burn zodiac

Sepsis locusts lay on my tongue
Reveal all the crimes that I have done

Zodiac don't leave me alone again.
Please take me to a place with no more pain.
Zodiac take my life away.
