What I see, where it went, traveled through consequence
No mistake, different views turn over on the choose
Different outlook, different lies drown in my despise
A conversation, deafened shout, I've been blind and bound

Gravel is my life
It shows me truth
Gravel holding me down
Gravel holding us down

Gravel

Back down, fallout, one motherfucker down
One thing dragging me down through the ground
This life, the meaningless life is like gravel in the hand
Why don't you tell me what you stand for
So confident in who you are
You're another piece of gravel
Gravel is nothing, gravel is you

You can't tell me who you are
Even when you know yourself
You can't tell me who you are
Even when you know yourself
You can't tell me who you are
Even when you know yourself

Gravel controlling me

Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel

Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
