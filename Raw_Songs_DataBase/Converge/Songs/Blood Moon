Blood moon ascends in night
As the cosmic eye
Free of the chains
That define our lives

It cuts through flesh and bone
Into the glow of souls
Gazing far and wide
Devoid of hope

You cut me open
But I won't let you find
What's under the surface
Entombed in my mind
Beneath the surface
It's grim to see
Oh it echoes
Then disappears

Unblinking eye in the shadows
Abets the world its weary lies
Enthroned beside the dimming light
Speak what's left unspoken
The time is near

Blood moon ascends in the night
Cosmic unblinking eye
Gazing through flesh and bone
Into the glow of our souls

Blood moon ascends in the night
Cosmic unblinking eye
Gazing through flesh and bone
Into the glow of our souls

The mind was a hall that towered high
And on the throne was the child inside
And on my side, enthroned beside
The shadows divine held all the world
And the glimmering life
In mind was a time when all was right
Mind was in mind

Blood moon ascends in the night
Cosmic unblinking eye
Gazing through flesh and bone
Into the glow of our souls

Blood moon ascends in the night
Cosmic unblinking eye
Gazing through flesh and bone
Into the glow of our souls

Cut me open
It's grim to see
Beneath the surface, etched in fear
The day has spoken
How dare you speak her name
To consecrate the broken
Carry weary worlds

The day has broken
A stain, a crime
You, serpent
Deicide
The day has broken
A stain, a crime
You, serpent
Deicide
