Flower moon
Hanging like a curse
Puncturing the dark
Wilting in reverse

Join you in the sky
Seize you eye to eye
Won't you stay in bloom?
Oh, flower moon

Flower moon
Tangled in the trees
Shining through
Wilting in the leaves

Join you in the sky
Seize you eye to eye
Won't you stay in bloom?
Oh, flower moon
Flower

Join you in the sky
Seize you eye to eye
Won't you stay in bloom?
Oh, flower moon
Flower moon
