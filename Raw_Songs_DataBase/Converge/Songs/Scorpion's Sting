Come to me
Stand in witness
Come to me
Stand in witness

Oh, to see you
All the better
In joy or pain
I'll stay by your side

Come to me
Hold on tight, baby
Come to me
We are destructing

Sing, destroy, to create
We sing to love
Then we break
Who are...
Who are we?
Who are...
Who are we?

Overcome, vanquished
She is calling my name
And I'm answering
Baby, come
Baby, come to me
Take my hand
The scorpion's sting

All the better
Oh, to see you
Big eyes

Calm the storm, inside
'Cause I'll be right here by your side
