You've taken these chances and don't expect a change
You better not look back now, you're well on your way
You've gotten everything, you've taken too much to protect
You look at me, what do you expect

For me to stand for you
And help you along the way?
For me to stand by you
But did you ever think?

Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back

You've taken these chances and don't expect a change
You better not look back now, you're well on your way
You've gotten everything, you've taken too much to protect
You look at me, what do you expect

(Did you ever know)

Did you ever think
You would have to crawl
Did you ever think
You could handle it all

Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back

Look back
 look back
 look back
 look back
 look back
Look back
