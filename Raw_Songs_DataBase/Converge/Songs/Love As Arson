All these fairy tales forever welcome everyone in,
And it's no wonder that she fell from his great blue sky.
I can still taste my defeat on these lips
And you still have Hell welled up in your eyes.
I will burn that bridge when we get it it. Erase the sun.
These days we laugh a little slower,
And we push our fears a little lower than I ever thought we'd sink.
To those who've killed this hope, a presage,
I will rise again. Phoenix in flight,
I'm here to break your wings. I welcome this.
Don't let this heart stop beating I won't let this heart stop beating
And I will rise again and again. I will rise again
