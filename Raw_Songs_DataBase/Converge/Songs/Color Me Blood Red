Please love, just come home again
Just let this one pass, there will be another
And in this laughter before the pain
Every deliberate hung by my left hand
Eyelids fludder and warm water floods my nostrils
Neck deep I cry high
Together we sleep, slouched discolored porcelain
Dreaming of those elucid moments
When smiles hung high
Limbs outstretched
A bad moon rising
Faucet turning
Desolation churning
Drowning in what we've become
Neck deep I cry high
I have spilled dry for you
And you cannot fathom the notion
That it was the end of something
This is our end
