From a victim to a friend
Don't ever let them in
Keep your scars on your sleeve
And your heart in your hands
All the whores with their wars
Their gaping mouths want more
All of them choke on regret
We sit in silence

Dead or dedicated
Alive or medicated
A coward queen or harlot heart, it's up to you

From a victim to a friend
Don't ever let them in
Keep your scars on your sleeve
And your heart in your hands
All the whores with their wars
Their gaping mouths want more
All of them choke on regret
We sit in silence

Dead or dedicated
Alive or medicated
A coward queen or harlot heart, it's up to you
Dead or dedicated
Alive or medicated
A coward queen or harlot heart, it's up to you

This world owes you nothing
This world owes me nothing
This world owes us nothing
This world owes us nothing

This world owes us nothing
But a hard road to walk
These mountains that we climb
Is everything we've lost

This world owes us nothing
But a hard road to walk
These mountains that we move
Is everything we've lost

It's all up to me and you
