When I see me in your eyes
I just want to go blind
When I build coffin worlds with words
I just want a place to hide
When old ghosts meet new regrets
My daylight fades to grey
When our days bring guilt and shame
My heart turns black

When I see me in your eyes
I just want to go blind
When our words build coffin worlds
I just want a place to hide
When old ghosts meet new regrets
My daylight fades to grey
When our days bring guilt and shame
My heart turns black

These are my tombs
Painted black and blue
These are my tombs
Painted for you
These are my tombs
Painted black and blue
These are my tombs
Painted just for you

Goodnight
Goodnight, dear
Goodbye
Goodnight
Goodnight, dear
Goodbye

Goodnight
Goodnight, dear
Goodbye
Goodnight
Goodnight, dear
Goodbye

Black rose, be my light
Black rose, be my light
Black rose, be my light
Black rose, be my light
Black rose, be my light
Black rose, be my light

In the darkest of days
Be my heart
In the darkest of nights
Be my heart
In the darkest of days
Be my heart
In the darkest of nights
Be my heart
