For lost hope and his son
I'll avenge what once was
For his name and his love
These cold hands spill their blood

For lost hope and his son
I'll avenge what once was
For his name and his love
These cold hands spill their blood

Grant me the strength
To stand up straight
To make them pay
Spill their blood

Grant me the strength
To bear this weight
Show me the way
Spill their blood
