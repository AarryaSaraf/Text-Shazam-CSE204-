Now it's us versus them
Now, just us versus them

Jaws are biting at your heels
We hunt you in bad dreams
We know just what you are
The secrets that you keep
Cloven hoof is pounding
Faster than your heart
Strength in desperation
And the sting of loss

Time to cut them down
It's us versus them
Time to take a stand
It's us versus them

Jaws are biting at your heels
We hunt you in bad dreams
We know just what you are
The secrets that you keep
Cloven hoof is pounding
Faster than your heart
Strength in desperation
And the sting of loss

Time to cut them down
It's us versus them
Time to take a stand
It's us versus them

Now it's us versus them
Now, just us versus them
