Five lives dead and gone
We breathe out of key and wonder
If you can hear the awkwardness in these tremors
Draining, cutting this cancer out
Teeth gaping yet I make no sound
Six hammers and one sky, falling
Five lives dead and gone
Mediocrity in believing in everything
And this lack of will has buried them forever
