You are nothing more than dying royalty
You are nothing more than a fading drama queen
Your spelling errors in love letters just stole your crown
You are nothing more than late night fantasy
You are nothing more than a rehearsed tragedy
Your spelling errors in love letters just killed your dream
Just killed you
You are nothing more than a dim lit whore
You are nothing more than a crashing bore
In your blood paid
You chase a shadow that will fade out as pain
