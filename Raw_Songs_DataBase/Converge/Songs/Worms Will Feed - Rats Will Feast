Saw you coming around my bend
Cutting teeth and breaking bread
Making moves and smearing friends
Your karma has been racking debts

Left your throne in foreclosed homes
Claimed that crown of decay
Built castle walls of blood and bone
To shield your soul from wither and decay
Worms will feed

Saw you slither around their necks
Sinking teeth into their flesh
Spitting venom, you're seeing red
You will fall where you lay your head

Left your throne in foreclosed homes
Claimed that crown of decay
Built castle walls from blood and bone
To shield your soul from wither and decay
Rats will feast

The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way

The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
