In pure ghost white I see what was mine
Drowned in jet black that haunts your shadows
Endless night begins
This forked road now bends
A forked tongue appears to lead us astray

All this that I have is all that you are
Cutting for love a new trophy scar
Just not worth the tears and penance
Not worth the blood that we both pour

I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain
I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain

I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain
Without your name
Without this pain

Born to burn with hell to pay
Born to burn we will someday
Born to burn with hell to pay
Born to burn we will someday

Born born to burn with hell with hell to pay
Born born to burn we will we will someday

I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain
I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without your name

I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain
I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without your name
