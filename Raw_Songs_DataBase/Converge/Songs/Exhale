Exhale
That's all you get for
And that is all you do
I won't exhale
And I won't breathe for you
Trying to do this just because I care
Because I care
I won't
Not for you
No
Trying to adjust my  because I care
Because I care for you
And I said I won't breathe for you
I'll never breathe for you, friend
Not for you
I will never do what you want me to
The way you want me to
No!
I won't ignore
And I won't ignore
I won't
That makes me so much sense
That you
Watch!
Why?
Watch!
