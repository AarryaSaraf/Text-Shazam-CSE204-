Compass rose
Pricking you
Bleed a map of stars
Battle wounds
Blood we drew
Busy making scars
Mess with it
Confess to it
Fate already knows
Tracing us
Embracing us
Where a flower grows

Stand in the way and fate will simply go around
Forces at play flipping worlds upside down
Trembling souls shaken into piles of bone
Blood running cold before it hardens into stone

Dragging on
Time and space
Face the black mirror
Moving hands
Glacial pace
Reflections nearer
Ravaging
Disparaging
Fate will split the earth
Falling in
This hole again
Dying sense of worth

Stand in the way
Stand in the way and fate will simply go around
Forces at play
Forces at play flipping worlds upside down
Trembling souls
Trembling souls shaken into piles of bone
Blood running cold
Blood running cold before it hardens into stone

Crimson stone
Crimson stone
Crimson stone
Crimson stone

Crimson stone
Crimson stone
Crimson stone
Crimson stone
