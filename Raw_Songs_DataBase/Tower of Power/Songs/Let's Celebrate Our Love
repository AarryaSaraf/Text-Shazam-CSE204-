I never worry about you
Cause I never doubt that you care
But sometimes life has a way of coming between us
And that's why I believe we better beware

We got a special thing
Make sure we treat it right
And always remember

Let's celebrate our love
Let's celebrate
Celebrate, let's celebrate our love

Oh you, you're always thinking about us
You wonder how we're gonna survive
But even when things get tough we always get through it
We do just what it takes to keep it alive

It's such a special thing
We got to treat it right
And always remember

Let's celebrate our love
Celebrate our love
Celebrate, let's celebrate
Celebrate
Let's celebrate our love
We've got to celebrate, it's such a good thing
Celebrate, let's celebrate our love

Gotta get a grip on our love
With a little help from above

Oh, we got a special thing
Make sure we treat it right
And always remember

Let's celebrate our love
Ooh, let's celebrate our love
