Going through the day, sometimes lonely
Trying to find myself a thrill
Little do I know it might come to me
Hanging out my window sill

Just another day, has gone, gone and left me
In the same old boat again, slowly drifting

Yes, I know my life is kind of strange
The thrill came down, but didn't last
Day by day the same old changes
Time seems to pass so fast

Just another day, has gone, gone and left me
In the same old boat again, aimlessly drifting

Good and bad, it's supposed to be, full of
That's the way they always told me
Life is a wheel of many displays
Happiness will come in simple way

Dreaming that I'm drifting on clouds of satin
I ride them till I get my fill
I just got to worry 'bout the pace I'm keeping
Making sure I'm still for real

Just another day, has gone, gone and left me
In the same old boat hey, again, slowly drifting

Just another day
