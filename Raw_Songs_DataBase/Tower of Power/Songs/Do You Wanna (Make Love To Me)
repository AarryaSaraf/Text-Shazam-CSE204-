Whoa whoa, baby

Most of the time you can't make up your mind
And that doesn't really bother me
But when it comes to us, indecisions a bust
I just gotta know how it will be, yeah, yeah, yeah

Girl, it's not a lot that I'm asking from you
I just wanna know

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
Or do you want me to set you free?
(Do you wanna make love?)
Now's the time let's take a swim, shut the door, but let me in
Do you wanna make love to me? Oh yeah
(Do you wanna?)

Bet you didn't know that you're movin' too slow
For me to know to even be amused
You've got perfect etiquette, so politically correct
But I suspect that just some what could use

Girl, it's not a lot that I'm asking from you
I just wanna know

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
Do you wanna make ecstasy?
(Do you wanna make love?)
Now's the time let's just take a chance, cultivate some true romance
Do you wanna make love to me? Oh yeah yeah
(Do you wanna?)

Girl, it's not a lot that I'm askin' from you
So make up your mind, baby
We've come much too far, there's no turnin' back
I need you tell me

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
Or do you want me to set you free?
(Do you wanna make love?)
Do you wanna make love to me?
Do you wanna make ecstasy?

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
Do you want me to set you free?
(Do you wanna make love?)
Now's the time let's just take a chance, cultivate some true romance, yeah

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
(Do you wanna? Oh baby)
Do you wanna make love to me?

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
( do you wanna make love?)
Do you wanna make love to me?
(You and me baby, yeah)

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
Do you wanna make love to me?
(Come on baby we've been doing this dance a long time)

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
(Do you wanna make love to me or what?)
Do you wanna?
(We've been together so long, I'm starting to wonder)
Do you wanna make love to me?
(I'm not goin to beg you, it's now or never)
