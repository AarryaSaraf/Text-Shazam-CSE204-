Lola likes her men in the palm of her hand
That' the way she's got it planned, Lola (Lola)
And James ain't ashamed with he's running his game
(As) long as he's not to blame, go James (go James)

As the world is going through it's changes
You better keep your eyes open wide
Cause in the middle of all this strangeness
I guess someones's singin' "Mama lied"

Mama lied, Mama lied...

My Moma don't mind, when I need to unwind
It's a sign of good times, good time (good times)
And if I choose to get loose, I don't need to get used
I'm tellin' the truth, no lie (no lie)

Maybe you don't like, what's going on 'round you
And the world goes slidin' by
It's not exactly what your Mama told you
And you're wondering, why your Mama lied

Mama lied, Mama lied...

As a little boy you were overjoyed
With everything your Mama told you (told you)
Not at thirty-five you start to realize
Life ain't the fairy-tale your Mama sold you

Mama lied, Mama lied...
