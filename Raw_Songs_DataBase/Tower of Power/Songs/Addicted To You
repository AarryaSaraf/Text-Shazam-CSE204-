Endlessly in love
Hopelessly in love
Head over heels in love
Addicted to you Baby
(Addicted to you) hey hey
(Addicted to you) addicted to you baby

The moment I laid eyes on you
I knew that my life had changed
There's no doubt that you felt it too
I knew we'd never be the same
Oh, thinking about it now baby
I get emotional inside
I love it when I get this feeling
It's such a supernatural high
Oh yeah
Girl I'm all strung out on you (on you baby)
There's nothing I can do

Endlessly in love
Hopelessly in love
Head over heels in love
Addicted to you Baby
(Addicted to you) I'm hooked on you, baby
(Addicted to you) can't help myself

It seems like only yesterday
I remember how you made me smile
And whenever you were far away
I felt like an abandoned child
I just couldn't do without you baby
I knew I had to make you mine
Now after all these years together
I still want to love you till the end of time, oh
Girl I'm all strung out on you (I'm strung out on you, baby)
What am I gonna do?

Endlessly in love
Hopelessly in love
Head over heels in love
Addicted to you Baby
(Addicted to you) Oh, I'm
(Addicted to you) and I just can't help it
(Addicted to you) I'm all about you baby
(Addicted to you) Hey, come on
What am I gonna do?
I'm hooked on you, baby
(Addicted to you, what am I gonna do?)
All about you baby
(Addicted to you, what am I gonna do?
Give it to me girl
(What am I gonna do about it?)
