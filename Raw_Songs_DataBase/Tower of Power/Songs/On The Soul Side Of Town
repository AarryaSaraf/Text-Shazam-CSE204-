I know a place
Where people ring true
The sort of place
They really care about you
It's kind of rough
But that's alright with me
Cause I dig the vibe
And I like the company

It's a world away
That's what the people say
Where you can sing your song
And do it all night long

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(The soul side)?

It's not a place
That people point you to
But you can find it
With your own point of view
Everybody's welcome
No matter who you are
It's one big family
And everyone's a star

It's a world away
That's what the people say
Where you can free your mind
Leave all your cares behind

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(The soul side)?

Listen to me now
Well it's a world away
That's what the people say
Oh it's the place to be
Gonna set you free

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(On the soul side)

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(On the soul side)

On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(On the soul side)

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(On the soul side)

On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side

On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side

On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side of town
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side

The soul side
The soul side
On the soul side
