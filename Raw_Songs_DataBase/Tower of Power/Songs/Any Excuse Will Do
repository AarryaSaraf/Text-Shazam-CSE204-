It's as good as could be expected in these uncertain times
But there must be many reasons for our precipitous decline

Blame it on the white man, blame it on the booze
Blame it on the Arabs and you can blame it on the Jews
Blame it on the Chinese cause they're growing by leaps and bounds
There's more than enough and plenty blame to go around

Blame it on religion, you could blame it on the press
Blame it on the bureaucrats I chalk it up to stress
Blame it on a mindset where waste and fraud abound
Yes there's more than enough and plenty blame to go around

Any excuse'll do, Any excuse'll do
When there's all this blame to go around
Any excuse will do
Any excuse'll do, Any excuse'll do
When there's all this blame to go around
Any excuse will do

Blame it on the unions, or blame it on your boss
Blame it on inflation, blame it on the cost
You might blame it on a system that has clearly broken down
There's more than enough and plenty blame to go around

Blame it on the others, blame it on the freaks
Blame it on the brothers, blame it on the geeks
You could blame it on the theory that money trickles down
Yes there's more than enough and plenty blame to go around

Any excuse'll do, Any excuse'll do
With all this blame to go around
Any excuse'll do
Any excuse will do, Any excuse'll do
With all this blame to go around
Any excuse will do

There's more than enough and plenty
More than enough and plenty
More than enough and plenty blame to go around

Any excuse'll do, Any excuse'll do
We keep blaming this, we keep blaming that
Any excuse will do
Any excuse'll do, Any excuse'll do
I'm telling you
Any excuse, any excuse
Any excuse will do

More than enough
And plenty of blame to go around
More than enough
And plenty of blame to go around
More than enough
Plenty of blame to go around
More than enough
Plenty of blame to go around
