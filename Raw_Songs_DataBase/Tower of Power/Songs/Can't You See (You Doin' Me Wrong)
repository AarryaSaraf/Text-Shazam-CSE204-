I've tried hard to do my best
So I could stand out from the rest
I can't figure out what you're all about, no
And I'm left standing here in doubt

Can't you see
Can't you see
(You're doing me wrong)
(For much too long)
(I can't go on) this way

There must be something I can do
To get this message through to you
Sometimes I think you're on my side
But you keep changing with the evening tide

Can't you see
Can't you see
(You're doing me wrong)
(For much too long)
(I can't go on) this way

Girl, I wish you only knew, yeah
What you're putting this man through
I can't give up on you, no
No matter what I try to do

Can't you see, I want you
Can't you see
(You're doing me wrong)
(For much too long)
(I can't go on) this way
...
