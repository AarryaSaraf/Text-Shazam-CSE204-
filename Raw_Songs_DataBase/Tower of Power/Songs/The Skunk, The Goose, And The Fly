Y'all heard 'bout the skunk?
He's got a lot more funk
Than any other animal - More Funk! Hey, hey, ha-hey
His walk and his goofy talk
And his funky breath, smell of brew - Yes They Do!

He's drunk as a skunk, drunk as a skunk
He's drunk as a skunk, drunk as a skunk
Ooh the skunk, Ah the skunk - drunk as a skunk
Ooh the skunk, Ah the skunk - drunk as a skunk

The Goose got's a lot more soul
Then you found in fairytales - More Soul!
He slips and he slides
And then skates all around, tranquilized - Dig His Eyes!

He's loose as a goose, loose as a goose
He's loose as a goose, loose as a goose
Ooh the goose, Ah the goose - loose as a goose
Ooh the goose, Ah the goose - loose as a goose

Well, the Fly, got's a lot more buzz
Always has more, brother - More Buzz! Oh yeah!
Well, he whips and he zips
And then zooms in and out, pushin' fine - Feels So Fine!

He's high as a common fly, oh me - oh my!
He's high as a common fly, oh me - oh my!
Who's a fly, High as a fly, high as a fly
Who's a fly, High as a fly, high as a fly

He's drunk as a skunk, drunk as a skunk
He's drunk as a skunk, drunk as a skunk
Say, ooh the skunk, ah the skunk, drunk as a skunk
Ooh skunk, he's drunk as a skunk - yeah

He's loose as a goose, loose as a goose
He's loose as a goose, loose as a goose
Ooh, ah, ooh, goose, ooh, ah, ooh, goose
Ooh-oo, love to get loose

He's high as a common fly, oh me, oh my
He's high as a common fly, oh me, oh my
Ooh the fly, Ah the fly, high as a fly
Ooh, Ah, Ooh, Ah, he loves the sky!
