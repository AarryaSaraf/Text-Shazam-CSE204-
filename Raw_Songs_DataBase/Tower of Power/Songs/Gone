Gone
Are the joyful days
Of sweet smelling pine
And morning mist
Gone
Are the joyful days
Like when the pine dies
And the mist dries
I, like a lonely gull, keep on searching

Gone
Are the joyful days
When the seasons change
I still remain the same
I turned to look for you
You were gone, ah yeah

You, you were gone...
