I see the fellas in the neighbourhood
Checking out the girls cause they sure look good
But most of them got girls at home
Aw, they are to think before they roam

Don't want to jeopardise a good thing
No you don't no you don't
Don't want to ruin your relationship
No you don't no you don't
No oh no

If the tables got turned on you
You know exactly what you would do

Believe it
When it comes to real love, yeah
You need it
Oh, yes you do
Believe it
Real soul love, yeah
You need it
Everybody

Temptation's bound to get you if you let it
But if you do you surely will regret it
Appreciate the love you got
Oh it's something special that can't be bought

Don't want to jeopardise a good thing
No you don't no you don't
Don't want to ruin your relationship
No you don't no you don't

If the tables got turned on you
You know exactly what you would do

Believe it
When it comes to real love, yeah
You need it
Oh, yes you do
Believe it
Real soul love
You need it
Everybody

If the tables got turned on you
You know exactly what you would do

Believe it
When it comes to real love, yeah
You need it
Oh, yes you do
Believe it
Real soul love, ey yeah
You need it
Everybody
