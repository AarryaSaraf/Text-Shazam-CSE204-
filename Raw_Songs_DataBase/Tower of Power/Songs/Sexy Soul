Remember when we met?
We'd listen to the radio;
Tuned in The Stylistics
And danced out on the patio.

But now we're always busy,
We never seem to get the chance
To spend some time together
To rekindle our romance.

Let's stay at home,
And listen to some sexy soul.
Just the two of us, alone,
There's nowhere else I'd rather go,
Let's listen to some sexy soul.

We'd drive up on the hilltop
Just to share the crystal view,
Diggin' Gladys and Aretha,
And then we'd swear our love was true.

But something came between us,
We never seemed to find the time,
And if we don't find the answer
It will seem like such a crime.

Let's stay at home,
And listen to some sexy soul.
Just the two of us, alone,
There's nowhere else I'd rather go,
Let's listen to some sexy soul.

We don't want to end up like the others do,
'Cause we've got something special and we both know just what to do:

Let's stay at home,
And listen to some sexy soul.
Just the two of us, alone,
There's nowhere else I'd rather go,
Let's listen to some sexy soul.
