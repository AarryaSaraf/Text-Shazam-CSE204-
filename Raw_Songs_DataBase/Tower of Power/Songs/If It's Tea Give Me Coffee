If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
I might become progressive
So there's less inequity
Still I hate paying taxes
So I might go G.O.P.
But if it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea

If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
I might believe that social justice is the way
It's meant to be
Still I'm hoping to get rich
I might go G.O.P.
But if it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea

Even if it's not a party
Even if it's just a clatch
If you can't tell the difference
I wanna know how you gonna mix and match

If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
I might become progressive
For accountability
Still I hate that bloated government
So I might go G.O.P.
If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea

Even if it's wishful thinking
Even if it's fantasyland
Someone's got to pay the tab
That's not so hard to understand

If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
I might become progressive
So there's less inequity
Still I hate paying taxes
So I might go G.O.P.
But if it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea

(Tea, give me coffee)
Come on
(Coffee, give me tea)
Said if it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
(Tea, give me coffee
Coffee, give me tea)
Said if it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
(Tea, give me coffee)
Alright
(Coffee, give me tea)
If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
