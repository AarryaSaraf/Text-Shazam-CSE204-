There is only so much oil in the ground
Sooner or later there won't be much around
Tell that to your kids while you're drivin' round downtown
That there's only so much oil in the ground

We can't cut loose without that juice
Can't cut loose without that juice
If we keep on like we doing
Things for sure will not be cool
It's a fact we just ain't got sufficient fuel

'Cause there's only so much oil in the ground
Sooner or later there won't be none around
Alternate sources of power must be found
'Cause there's only so much oil in the ground

Yes, there's only so much oil in the earth
It's a fact of life, for what it's worth
Something every little girl and boy should know from birth
That there's only so much oil in the earth

There's no excuse for our abuse
No excuse for our abuse
We just assume that what we use
Will not exceed the oil supply
But soon enough the world will watch the wells run dry

There's no excuse for our abuse
No excuse for our abuse
We just assume that what we use
Will not exceed the oil supply
But soon enough the world will watch the wells run dry

'Cause there's only so much oil in the ground
Sooner or later there won't be none around
You can tell that to your children while you're drivin' round downtown
That there's only so much oil in the ground

And there's only so much oil in the earth
Sooner than you think there's gonna be a heavy duty dearth
And there won't be too much time, for no merriment or mirth
'Cause there's only so much oil in the earth

We can't cut loose without that juice
Can't cut loose without that juice
If we keep on like we doing
Things for sure will not be cool
It's a fact we just ain't got sufficient fuel

(There is only so much oil...)
