Oh, my love, I've been waiting
For this moment to arrive
Just the two of us alone together
Makes me feel alive
I've got a lotta love to show you, girl
Everything I have I give to you, oh, you

I know you're the one for me
And I wanna be the one you're givin' it to
Oh, you, baby
And if you feel you need a little time
You best believe I'll be here waitin' for you
Oh, you, girl

We can fall in love
Don't have to be afraid of what we're hopin' for
Oh, darlin', one to one is the key to love
That will open up the door
We got a good thing goin' on, girl
And I can't help myself from bein' with you
Oh, you

I know you're the one for me
I wanna be the one you're givin' it to
Oh, you, baby
And if you feel you need a little time
You best believe I'll be here waitin' for you
Oh, you, baby

Every minute, every hour
Is like paradise whenever I'm with you
From the first time I saw you, girl
I knew right from the start that it was you
What could I do?

I know you're the one for me
I wanna be the one you're givin' it to
Oh, you, baby
And if you feel you need a little time
You best believe I'll be here waitin' for you
Oh, you, girl

I know you're the one for me
I wanna be the one you're givin' it to
Oh, you, baby
And if you feel you need a little time
You best believe I'll be here waitin' for you

Hear me talkin' to you, baby
Hear me talkin' to you, girl
Oh, you, baby
I love you and only you, baby
Oh, you, baby
