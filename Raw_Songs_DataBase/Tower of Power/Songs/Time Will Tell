It's a rare occasion
When your plans and expectations
Come down just exactly how you plan them
Hey, life's just that way

You better face the facts, sweet lady
Things change from day to day
It all depends upon the situation
Who can say anyway

(Time will tell) time will tell
Oh, then we'll both know so very well
(Time will tell) time will tell

So just be patient
Until you reach the realization
You can't have joy without a little sadness, too
That's just the way it is, hey

And girl, I believe we're gonna make it
But not without our share of ups and downs
You can't expect life to be a total paradise
But if we just pray together, girl, it will be so nice

(Time will tell) time will tell
Oh, and then we'll both know so very well
(Time will tell) time will tell, oh baby
Hey, hey

(Time will tell) oh, oh, girl
Take a little time out
I'm sure that you will see, ah
(Time will tell) you just keep on holdin' on, oh love
You gon' be able to make it with me

(Time will tell) oh, oh, baby
I need you, I want you, girl
I've got to have you, ah
(Time will tell) give me your time
Just wait on me, oh, girl
There's no tellin' how happy we gon' be
