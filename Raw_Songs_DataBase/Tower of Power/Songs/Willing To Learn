Why do I feel like there is now tomorrow
Sometimes I think that we're destined for sorrow
But maybe we might make it
With a just one more day
I'm just trying to tell you, baby
I'm willin' to learn
How to love you, baby

How can I explain the way I feel about you
There must be some kind of way
To prove I don't doubt you
Well see It's all in how you take it
But girl, I know, I know we can make it
I'm, I'm just trying to tell you, baby
I'm willin' to learn
How to love you, baby

The fact is I love you,
It ain't just spring fever, no no
Completely captivated
Girl, you made me a believer
Just breezing along with you
Should be more, should be more than I ask for
I'm, I'm just trying to tell you, baby
I'm willin' to learn
How to love you, baby

I'm gonna work my fingers down to the bone
I'll never, never leave you alone
I'll treat you right day and night

I'm willin' to learn
How to love you, baby
Gonna play a song for you all night long

Tell 'em how you feel, brother, brother
Sometimes you just gotta moan, baby
With words like "ooh"
You make me say "ooh"
O mama, you make me just want to moan all night long
I said, girl, I'm gonna treat you right
I'm gonna love you all night long

Said I'm gonna learn, baby
You make me want to do right
For the first time in my life
