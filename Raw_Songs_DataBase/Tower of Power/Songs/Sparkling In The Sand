When God made you
He had a lot to do
In a day or two
You were my dreams come true
Soul searching eyes
I visualize
A girl with heaven in her soul
If only you were mine
We'd have a mellow time
A pickin' flowers drinkin' wine
Rivers of love flowing through
Valleys of dew

A time or so
I felt you should be free
To wait for your
Prince charming to arrive
Then come the time
I know I can't survive
Without your heart beating 'neath my breath
If only you were mine
We'd have a mellow time
Pickin' the flowers and drinkin' wine
Rivers of love flowing through

No other love
Could ever compensate
A heart of stone
My ever lasting fate
Alone at night
Tears cloud my dreams
But through the haze
Her image lasts
Ooh if only you were mine
We'd have a mellow time
Pickin' flowers and drinkin' wine
Rivers of love flowing through
Valleys of dew...
You're a diamond sparkling in the sand...
