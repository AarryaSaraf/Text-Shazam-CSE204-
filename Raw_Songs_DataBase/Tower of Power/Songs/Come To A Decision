You want it your way, I want it mine
It's gonna take both of us to try
Put it back together
It's better late than never
We can make it work out right this time

Saying you love me isn't easy
'Cause everything I do is far from pleasing
Allow me to apologize
Before you wanna say goodbye
Try to understand
There's a reason

We've got to come to a decision
Right away
'Cause tomorrow is too late to start again
We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
Running out of tears to cry
I'll lose my mind

Waiting for the right place and the right time
To tell ya what's been going on in my mind
Maybe we should take it slow
But I just wanna let you know
We've come too far to leave it all behind

I tried to give you love but you wouldn't take it
I don't know what I'll do if we don't make it
Girl I'm so glad I found you
I've built my whole world around you
Right here in my heart
I feel it breaking

We've got to come to a decision
Right away
Because tomorrow is too late to start again
We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
Running out of tears to cry
I'll lose my mind

From now on
You will come to see a change
From now on
You'll no longer have to wait
To see a different side
Come on let's take that ride
Into paradise
It would be so nice

If we could come to a decision
Right away
Because tomorrow is too late to start again
We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
Running out of tears to cry
I'll lose my mind, right away
Because tomorrow is too late to start again

We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
Running out of tears to cry
I'll lose my mind, right away
Because tomorrow, oh don't you know
That it's much too late to start again

We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
Running out of tears to cry
I'll lose my mind
Because tomorrow is too late to start again

We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
I feel like I'm running out of tears to cry
Yeah
