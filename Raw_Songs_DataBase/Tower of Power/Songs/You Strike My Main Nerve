You're messing with my mind
Think about me all the time
Why you wanna be unkind
The best man you'll ever find
I wish that you could see
Just what you do to me

You strike my main nerve
(My main nerve's been struck)
Girl
(My main nerve's been struck)
You babe
(My main nerve's been struck)
My main nerve
(Your boy's been struck)

When you hit the set
Smoking like a cigarette
My eyes light up like fire
For the girl that I desire
I wish that you could see
Just what you do to me

You strike my main nerve
(My main nerve's been struck)
Girl
(My main nerve's been struck)
You babe
(My main nerve's been struck)
My main nerve
(Your boy's been struck)

If I had my way
We'll be moving right today
That way that I've been struck
I swear that I'd been hit by a mack truck
I wish that you could see
What you do to me

You strike my main nerve
(My main nerve's been struck)
Get it babe
(My main nerve's been struck)
You got it
(My main nerve's been struck)
Talk about the pain
(Your boy's been struck)

That's what you do to me, baby
Ooh, mama, yeah
My main nerve's been struck
My main nerve's been struck
You have my main nerve's been struck
You did my main nerve's been struck
You you you you...
You hit the stick
Just smoking like a cigarette
You just strike my main nerve
Strike my main nerve
Hey baby
Hey lady
You know what you do to me
