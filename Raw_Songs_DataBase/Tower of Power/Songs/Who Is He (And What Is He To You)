A man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you, you looked at the ground
I don't know who he is but I think that you do
Dag gummit, who is he and what is he to you?

Something in my heart and in your eyes
Tells me that he's not someone passin' by
And when you cleared your throat was that your cue?
Dag gummit, who is he and what is he to you?

Now when I add the sum of you and me, dig this
I get confused 'cause I keep coming up with three
Well listen, you're too much for one man and not enough for two
Dag gummit, who is he and what is he to you?
What is he to you? I wanna know

Now tell me you that man don't have much intuition, no
Is that what you really think woman or are you wishin'?
Listen, before you wreck your old home be sure about your new
Dag gummit, who is he? What is he to you?
What is he to you? Someone, somebody say it

Say it again baby
Woman respect yourself, respect yourself
Who was that man with you girl?
What is he to you? 'Cause who was he to you?

What is he to you?
Tell me who are you lovin'?
Who is he to you, baby?
Respect yourself, respect yourself
Who was he to you?
Who was he to you lady?
I gotta know right now
Just tell me
