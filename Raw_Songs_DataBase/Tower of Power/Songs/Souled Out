There's a place where everybody's goin to
It's the place that's the place to be
It's the scene where everybody wants to be seen
If you choose to go and get your mind right, your body will follow
What you better be there, way ahead of time, uh, or stand in line

Everybody's gonna be there
There'll be party people everywhere
'Cause one thing you know for sure
It's souled out
Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there

Late at night the place will be bumpin
So you better bring your dancin' shoes
Cause there's gonna be some hot, funky rhythm and blues
If you choose to go and make a standing, that's not hard just follow
But there's gonna be some competition there, uh, so beware

With a little bit of soul now
With some positive emotion
And one thing you know for sure
It's souled out
Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there
It's souled out
Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there
It's souled out
It's souled out
It's souled out
It's souled out

It's souled out
Party people everywhere
It's souled out
Throw your hands up in the air
It's souled out
Player got their dancin' shoes
It's souled out
Got no time to have no blues
It's souled out
Party people everywhere
It's souled out
Throw your hands up in the air
It's souled out
If you have the  T.O.P.
It's souled out
Somebody, everybody, come on and say oh yeah!
It's souled out

Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there
It's souled out
Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there
It's souled out
Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there
It's souled out...
