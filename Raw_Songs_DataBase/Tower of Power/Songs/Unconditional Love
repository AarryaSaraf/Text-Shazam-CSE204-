I used to be a part time lover
Just droppin' by every once in a while
I had to do it undercover, yes I did
That was just my style

Now I have the strangest feeling
This love has really got me reeling
Everything we do is together
This love I have for you is forever, oh

Unconditional love, unconditional
That is what I have for you
Here's my position of love, unconditional
Love is what I have for you

Never cared about tomorrow
I only thought about what I could get today
I left behind a trail of sorrow, mmm
That was just my way

Still it didn't even come close
To fillin' up that hole in my soul
Now I had a change of heart
Girl I hope that we will never part

You love me, I love you
And that's the way it's s'posed to be
Together forever from now until eternity

Unconditional love, unconditional
That is what I have for you
Here's my position of love, unconditional
Love is what I have for you
