Whenever something's wrong
I will be there

When the whole world is on your shoulder
And you don't know which way to turn
Even though the rain is falling down
The sun comes through the clouds
And everything will be all right

I'll soothe ya (soothe ya)
Baby I will soothe you (yeah)
I'm gonna soothe ya (soothe ya)
For ever by your side

If ever there's a problem, inside you
I'm here to listen to your heart, yeah yeah
When you see the writing on the wall
That your world's about to fall
Baby you can talk with me

I'll soothe ya (soothe ya), mm
Baby I will soothe ya, sooth ya, sooth ya (yeah)
I'm gonna soothe ya (soothe ya)
If you think you had in mind

And just keep holding on
Until I see that sparkle in your eyes, yeah yeah
Open up the door
There must be a thousand reasons why
For woman cry

I'll soothe ya

Then I see the heartbreak you embrace
Written on your face
Girl I'm gonna take them being away

I'll soothe ya (soothe ya), ooooh baby, baby, baby
(Soothe ya, well) yeah well girl
(Soothe ya) Girl I'm gonna make you feel so good
(Soothe ya)
Yeah (for ever by your side)

(Soothe ya) Come on hold and let me run somehow I'll do
It for you baby (soothe ya)
(Soothe ya) I have it here on the table oooh woow I'm
Gonna make you real good (soothe ya)
(Soothe ya) And then we woke up and did the things we
Used to do make love to you all night alone baby
(That what you had in mind)

(Soothe ya) I will, I will hold you baby. Nobody has
Ever made you feel, the way that I make you feel ooooh
(Soothe ya)
