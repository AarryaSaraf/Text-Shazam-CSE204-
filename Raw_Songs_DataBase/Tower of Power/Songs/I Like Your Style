I remember the first day we met
That's the day I'll never forget
You came into my life, made everything right
I remember the first time we touched
Never knew that I could love so much
You ignited the flame, and I still feel the same

I like your style (I like your style)
I like your smile (I like it baby)
I love your heart and I loved you right from the start

I made a wish upon a lucky star
For someone special just the way you are
That wish came true, oh when I found you
I can still see that star shining bright
With this love there's no end in sight
It's just you and me, we're destined to be

I like your style (I like your style)
I like your smile (I like it baby)
I love your heart and I loved you right from the start

Each day is new (I like your style)
When I'm with you (I like it baby)
It's more than okay, getting better each and every way, yeah

There's only one thing that I'd like to do
I want to spend my whole life with you
Till death do us part, because you captured my heart

I like your style (I like your style)
I like your smile (I like it baby)
Each day is new (I like your style)
Oh, when I'm with you, baby
Oh, oh, oh, I like your style
(I like your style)

Come on now with me, I like your style
(I like your style)
You've got a sexy smile, now sugar
(I like your style)
Ooh... I like your smile now baby
(I like your style)

You sexy baby, sexy lady
I just want to be with you baby, baby
(I like it baby)
