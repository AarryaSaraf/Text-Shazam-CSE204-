You could be in New York City, or even in Paris France
But when you're in the Oakland Zone, you remember how to dance, y'all
You could be a hustler, you might give those dice a roll
But when you're in the Oakland Zone, you do it with a lotta soul

You might live in a harem, or maybe even out of a trunk
But when you're in the Oakland Zone you do it with a lot of funk, y'all
You might be in turmoil or total serenity
But when you're in the Oakland Zone, you be listenin' to R and B

Oakland Zone (Tower of Power)
In the Oakland Zone

Uh! We gonna make it really funky right about here! Come on! Doctor!

Hu! Ow! In the Oakland Zone! Come on y'all... Everybody sing!

You might be feelin' happy or drownin' in the blues
But when you're in the Oakland Zone, at least you're gonna catch a groove, y'all
You might be an old geezer, or you might be a real young punk
But when you're in the Oakland Zone you're really gonna funk it up... ooh!

Oakland Zone (Tower of Power)
In the Oakland Zone
Oakland Zone (T-O-P)
In the Oakland Zone
Oakland Zone (Tower of Power)
In the Oakland Zone
