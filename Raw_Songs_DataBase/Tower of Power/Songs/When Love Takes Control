Standing in the pouring rain
Another day that looks the same as yesterday
Thinking bout her all the time
No matter what I do it just won't go away
Like the way she lays her head upon my shoulder
A little piece of heaven when I hold her

When love takes control
There's no escaping
What everyone knows
When love takes its toll
Even though the best of hearts
Yet still we surrender our souls

Just can't seem to let it go
Looking back I should have known we wouldn't last, oh
Fell in love recklessly
Couldn't see that we were moving way too fast, oh
We only knew we had to bond together
That what we had was sure to last forever (Forever) Oh

When love takes control
There's no escaping
What everyone knows
When love takes its toll
Even though the best of hearts
Yet still we surrender our souls

(When love takes control)
When love takes control
(Love takes its toll)
It truly takes its toll now
(When love takes control)
Oh when love takes control
(Love takes its toll)

I don't feel any wiser, only older
It's just the living things I wish I told her (I told her)

When love takes control
Oh, there's no escaping
What everyone knows
When love takes its toll
Even though the best of hearts
Yet still we surrender our souls

(When love takes control)
When love takes control
(Love takes its toll)
Truly takes its toll now
(When love takes control)
Yeah when love takes control
(Love takes its toll)

Takes its toll
Oh, yeah
