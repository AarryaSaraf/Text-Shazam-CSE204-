I remember lonely days
Having no one to talk to
Drifting slowly from place to place
Never knowing just what to do

But I'm not lonely now
My outlook has been altered how
I've changed my attitude
I feel mellow inside

What happened to the world (that day)
You came into my life (to stay)
Forever ever in my arms

Day by day a steady stream
Of happiness and sorrow
Facing changes as they come
For that always tomorrow

With you so close to me
Having all the faith that I'll need
To face the world outside
With all that I am

What happened to the world (that day)
You came into my life (to stay)
Forever forever in my arms

A little here, ooh, and a little there
Patiently building our dream
Coming home at six o'clock
I can just feel the warmth of love

A guiding light
My hope, my joy, my reason
For living this life I lead
You're all that I need

What happened to the world (that day)
You came into my life (to stay)
Oh yeah, yeah baby

(What happened to the world)
I remember it well yeah
(What happened to the world)
It was on a special day baby
(What happened to the world)
Oh sweet mama
(What happened to the world)
(What happened to the world)
(What happened to the world)
(What happened to the world)
Was you oh baby
That's what happened on the special day
Ooh
You come on in
And took control baby
I got to say it loud
Cause I'm so proud of you mama
Cause for now I'm proud
And we're together
Yeah baby say we're together
Me and you and you and me, baby
That's what happened on that special day
Come on in
