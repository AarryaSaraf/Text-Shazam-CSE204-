Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Living for the moment
I'd do almost anything
No matter how hard it tried
I've just gotten by
Never would've known it
It wasn't my destiny
I felt like I'd fallen apart
Then you came and captured my heart

(Can't stop thinking about you) No, no
Can't get you out of my head
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) You're...
You're always there, I see you everywhere
(Can't stop thinking about you) No-oh
Can't get you out of my head
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) oh, oh, oh-oh
You're always there, I see you everywhere
Woo-ooh

I was just a loner
Drifting from here to there
(Drifting to there)
Each and every plan I made
Turned out bad
Thought I had the answers
I didn't know anything
I felt I was losing control
Then you came and captured my soul

(Can't stop thinking about ya) No
Can't get you out of my head
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) Oh
You're always there, I see you everywhere
(Can't stop thinking about you) Oh, no, no
Can't get you out of my head, no
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) no-oh
You're always there, I see you everywhere
Everywhere

(Can't stop thinking about you) Oh girl
Can't get you out of my head, no, no, no, no, no
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) No matter how hard I try
You're always there, I see you everywhere
(Can't stop thinking about you) Oh
Sweet, sweet baby, I love you so much
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) I just can't help it baby
You're always there, I see you everywhere

(Can't stop thinking about you) No, oh girl
You captured my heart
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) I just don't wanna stay, when I feel this way
(You're always there) somebody help me please
(Can't stop, can't stop) No
(Can't stop, can't stop)
You're always there, I see you everywhere
