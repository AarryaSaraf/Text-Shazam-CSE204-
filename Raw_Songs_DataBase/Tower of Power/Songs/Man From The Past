Out of the past, he came a-walkin',
and he waked right back into your life.
Ain't no need, in you tryin' to deny it girl,
cuz you know I ain't tellin' no lie.
I can tell by the look in your eye,
that the fire for him, still burning you inside.
Since he's been back girl,
things just seemed to change.
Why the other night, in your sleep, you even called out his name.

I thought our love would last,
but it seems I've been replaced by a man from the past.

(Out of the past, he came walkin',
and he walked all over our love)

When we first got together,
you said your thing with him was through.
I was in love, so I believed ya,
but what you said girl, didn't quite ring true.
When you were with him, he hurt you before.
Now you seem to wanna run off back for more.
Oh I just can't accept the reasons that you give,
cuz' losin' you'll make life so hard to live.

I thought our love would last,
but it seems I've been replaced by a man from the past.

(Out of the past, he came walkin',
and he walked all over our love)

How could you treat a good man so bad?
You went on out and ruined all the plans we had.
Girl I wish that man would let us be;
I wanted your love to belong only to me.

I thought our love would last,
but it seems I've been replaced by a man from the past.

(Out of the past, he came walkin',
and he walked all over our love)

Out of the past, he came a-walkin',
out of the past girl, he came a-talkin',
out of the past, he came a-stalkin',
out of the past child, he came a-honkin'.

He was walkin', talkin', honkin', stalkin', tamperin', on our love, oh God, oh God.
That evil man, that dirty man, he took our love,
and he crushed, it in his hand, oh God.
