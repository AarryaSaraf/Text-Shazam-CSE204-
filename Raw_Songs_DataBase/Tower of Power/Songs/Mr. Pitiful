Listen to this

Call me Mr. Pitiful, baby that's my name
They call me Mr. Pitiful, that's how I got my fame
But you see people just don't understand
What make a man feel so blue
They call me Mr. Pitiful 'cause I lost someone just like you

Call me Mr. Pitiful, this everybody knows
They call me Mr. Pitiful most everyplace I go
But you see nobody seems to understand
How can a man sing such a sad, sad song
When he lost, when he lost everything
When he lost everything he had

How can I explain to you
How somebody could be so very blue?
How can I tell you about my past
If things won't even last?

Mr. Pitiful that's my name
They call me Mr. Pitiful, that's how I got my fame
Some people won't understand
What makes a man feel so very blue
They call me Mr. Pitiful because I am in love with you

Can I explain to you?
I've lost everything I had
Everything is going wrong
Just trying to get back to you

I have to sing this sad, sad songs
I want you, I want you, I want you
Get back, I've got to have you
I want you, I want you, I want you
