// Drop It In The Slot //

Drop it in the slot
Drop it in the slot
Drop it in the slot
You gonna dig it or not
So give it all you got
Drop it in the slot
Boilin' in the pot
Till it's super hot

Drop it, drop it in the slot
Drop it in the slot
Give it all you got, oh now now
Drop it in the slot
Drop it in the slot

Drop it, drop it in the slot
Drop it in the slot
Give it all you got, oh now now
Drop it in the slot
Drop it in the slot

Catch the groove
Don't move and reprove
Drop it in the slot
If you like it or not
Go ahead and shoot your shot

Catch the groove
Don't move and reprove
Drop it in the slot
If you like it or not
Go ahead and shoot your shot

Drop it in the slot
Everybody, drop it in the slot
Come on, come on, come on, now

Drop it in the slot
Everybody, drop it in the slot
Come on, come on, come on, now

Come on, now, drop it in the slot
Drop it in the slot
Come on now now now
Drop it in the slot
Come on now drop it in the slot
Drop it, give it, give it
Give it all you got
Come on, now now, everybody
