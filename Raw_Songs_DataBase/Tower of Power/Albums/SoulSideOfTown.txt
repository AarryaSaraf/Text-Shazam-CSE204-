// East Bay! All Day! //

East bay, all day
Oakland all the way
East bay, all day
Oakland all the way

// Hangin' With My Baby //

Monday morning I go to work, same old story
Putting in time with a bunch of jerks
And all their fame and glory

It's such a sad scenario
What I go through day to day
I guess that's just the way it goes
What it's come to, to make my way, eh

But when my work day's done
I get the greatest feeling
'Cause when I get back home
I'm gonna be...

Hangin' with my baby
(It's alright)
(Hangin' with my baby)
Alright
Said I'm gonna be
Hangin' with my baby
(Hangin' with my baby)
Well

Sunday morning, we're laying up (laying up)
Just relaxing, ooh
Doing nothing all alone (all alone)
No phone calls or faxing

There's music on the stereo
Something sexy, sweet and smooth
This is the only way to go
Me and my lady back in the groove, ooh

(Yes this is where it's at)
Oh yeah
It's really very simple, oh
('Cause there is nothing that)
That can compare, ow

To hanging with my baby, yeah
(It's alright)
(Hangin' with my baby)
Oh
Said nothing can compare
To hangin' with my baby
(Hangin' with my baby)
Woo! Come on

Ooh!
Coming to get 'em
I'm coming to get 'em
Woo!
Good God, come on
Yeah, DG, hit me hard
Ow!

Come on, Roger!
Horns, play!
Stick it!
Get on in there Roger!
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh

(Yes when my work day's done)
Oh yeah, I get the greatest feeling
('Cause when I get back home)
I'm gonna be...
Hey! Come on, say it ya'll
I'm gonna be

Be hanging with my baby
(It's alright)
(Hangin' with my baby)
Woo! yeah...
Hangin' with my baby
(Hangin' with my baby)

Y'all don't understand what I'm saying
(It's alright) It feels so good to be
(Hangin' with my baby)
Ha! Yes it does
Woo!
Hangin' with my baby
(Hangin' with my baby)
Ow!

// On The Soul Side Of Town //

I know a place
Where people ring true
The sort of place
They really care about you
It's kind of rough
But that's alright with me
Cause I dig the vibe
And I like the company

It's a world away
That's what the people say
Where you can sing your song
And do it all night long

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(The soul side)?

It's not a place
That people point you to
But you can find it
With your own point of view
Everybody's welcome
No matter who you are
It's one big family
And everyone's a star

It's a world away
That's what the people say
Where you can free your mind
Leave all your cares behind

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(The soul side)?

Listen to me now
Well it's a world away
That's what the people say
Oh it's the place to be
Gonna set you free

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(On the soul side)

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(On the soul side)

On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(On the soul side)

On the soul side of town
(The soul side)
On the soul side of town
(On the soul side)

On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side

On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side

On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side of town
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side
On the soul side

The soul side
The soul side
On the soul side

// Do It With Soul //

Let's do it, do it with soul
Let's do it, do it with soul

If you gonna do it, do it with soul
If you gonna do it, do it with soul
Make sure it's hot
Give it all you got
Till it's out of control

If you gonna do it, do it with soul
Make up your mind, get off the shelf
Don't let your life just pass you by
Stop wasting time, reapply yourself
Hey, we got pulverized and now we're back

The main thing I wanna tell you
Don't do it with no one else
Do it for yourself

If you gonna do it, do it with soul
If you gonna do it, do it with soul
Move ahead with confidence, don't hold back
It's time to take control

If you gonna do it, do it with soul
The time is right, you better make a move
Now is the time to run away
Stand up and fight, what's there to lose
What's there to lose, you might not-a live another day

The main thing I wanna tell you
Don't do it for no one else
Do it for yourself (Ow!)

If you gonna do it, do it with soul
If you gonna do it, do it with soul
Make sure it's hot, give it all you got
Till it's out of control
If you gonna do it, do it with soul

Let's do it, let's do it with soul

Move your head with confidence, don't hold back
It's time to take control

Yeah do it, come on, with soul
Let's do it, oh, with soul
Yeah, do it, everybody
Do it with soul
Let's do it, with soul

Do it with soul

// Love Must Be Patient And Kind //

Takes more than passion
Or the latest fashion
You must be sensitive to her needs
Oh-oh

Promises kept
And obligations met
Whoa, whoa, whoa
It just shows up
In all your rights and deeds

(For love to survive)
For love to survive
(It must be patient and kind)
It must be patient and kind
(Keep the magic right)
Just do your best to keep in mind that
Love... must be patient and kind

This is what you're gonna do

Cheer her when she's sad
(When she's sad)
Call her when she's mad
(When she's mad)
Always be there for her
And you'll see (you'll see)
You will see

Love never dominates, no
It always cultivates, yeah
That is the key
To blissful harmony

(For love to survive)
For love to survive
(It must be patient and kind)
It must be patient and kind
(Keep the magic right) ooh, what you gonna do?
Just do your best to keep in mind that
Love... must be patient and kind

Whoa-whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-whoa, ooh-ooh

(For love to survive)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
(It must be patient and kind)
It must be patient and kind
(Keep the magic right)
Just do your best to keep in mind that
Love... oh, love, must be patient and kind

Ooh-ooh, yeah
Love must be patient and kind

// Selah //

Selah
Selah
Selah
Selah

I was on my merry way
To the happily ever after
I thought I had it all figured out
Then pain replaced the laughter

Like a bull in a china shop
I destroyed everything I'd see
I had to learn it the hard way
I'm not the master of my destiny

'Cause it all comes crashing down
Sooner or later
Forced to face defeat
Is it time for flight
Or stand and fight?
For what is right
I don't know

Selah
Can I get an Amen?
I ain't never going down that road again
Selah
Say it again
I ain't never going down that road again
No

My friends tried to warn me
I was just too blind to see
But I was bound and determined
And as wrong as I could be

Thought I knew what I had to do
I was sure I would have it all
It hit me like a ton of bricks
Pride goes before the fall

'Cause it all comes crashing down
Sooner or later
Forced to face defeat
Is it time for flight
Or stand and fight?
For what is right
I don't know
Ho-ho!

Selah,
Can I get an Amen?
I ain't never going down that road again
Selah
Let me say it again
I ain't never going down that road again
No
No, no, no

Selah
Selah
Oh yeah

'Cause it all comes crashing down
Sooner or later
Forced to face defeat
Is it time for flight
Or stand and fight?
For what is right, I don't know, I don't know

Selah
Can I get an Amen?
I ain't never going down that road again
Selah
Let me say it again
I ain't never going down that road again

Selah
Can I get an Amen?
I ain't never going down that road again
Selah
Oh yeah
I ain't never going down that road again
No, no, no, no, no

Selah
Selah
I ain't going down that road no more
Not me
Uh-uh
No
I ain't going there

// Let It Go //

When I see your face lying next to me at night
I can't help but wonder why it doesn't feel right
Pretty as a picture, warm as summer sun
I don't understand why I feel I've got to run

I know you love me no matter what I do
I just wish I felt the same way that you do

Let it go, that's all I can do
Let it go, right now
Eh, to thine own self be true
Let it go, ooh-ooh, that's all I can say
Let it go, this time, oh, it's better that way

I look into your eyes, the truth is what I see
You and I together, that's not our destiny
Don't wanna face it, but it's long overdue
Gotta stop pretending, it's just not fair to you

Gonna take some courage to say what's on my mind
But in the name of true love, let's leave the past behind

Let it go, that's all I can do
Let it go, right now, alright
To thine own self be true
Let it go, ooh-ooh, that's all I can say
Let it go, this time, it's better, better that way

Let it go, let it go

Gonna take some courage what's on my mind
In the name of true love, let's leave the past behind
Who knows what we're gonna find

Let it go, oh, that's all I can do
Let it go, right now, let it go, gotta be true
Let it go, come on, 'cause that's all I can say
Let it go, this time, it's better, it's better that way
Let it go, got to let it go
Let it go right now, hey, hey, oh now baby
Let it go, ooh-ooh
Let it go, this time, I can't help it, what am I gonna do
Let it go, I've got to let it go
Let it go, right now, oh, oh na na
Let it go, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Let it go, this time, let it go, let it go
Let it go...

// Stop //

The other night I was thinking
Of going out, doing some drinking
I didn't think of what I was doing
Another step, I might be ruined
(Blinded by foolish pride)
I'll admit it, I'm not too clever
I might've died, I guess I better wake up
'Cause it looks like it's time

To stop (Stop it)
Come on, now, sing it
Stop it (Stop it)
Oh

It's been a while that I've been lucid
I haven't done nothing stupid
I can't say I ain't been tempted
Believe it or not but they accepted
(Blinded by foolish pride)
I admit, I'm not too clever
I could've slipped, so I better wake up
'Cause it looks like it's time

To stop (Stop it)
Hey yeah, I better, better
Stop yeah (Stop it)

And this may be my one and only chance to get it right
Hey, I don't wanna lose it all without putting up a fight
So I might just wanna stop, ow!
Ooh!

Play it, boy!

Without a doubt I'll be lucky
It could've been really yucky
No excuse, just quit trying
Drop the ball, no use in lying
(Blinded by foolish pride)
I'll admit, I'm not too clever
I might've died, I guess I better wake up
It looks like it's time

To stop (Stop it)
Oh
Better stop yeah (Stop it)
Listen

Then this may be my one and only chance to get it right
Oh, I don't wanna lose it all without putting up a fight
So I might just wanna stop

(Stop it)
Oh I know I gotta stop, yeah (Stop it)
Hah, it won't be too long before I'll be gone (Stop it)
If I don't stop
Oh yeah (Stop it) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(You better stop) (Stop) (Stop it)
Oh, don't go down that road no more
(You better stop)
Think about stopping now (Stop it)
It might be time (Stop it)
(You better stop)
Gotta get it up together (Stop it)
It's for my own good (Stop it)
Wake up (Stop it)
Before it's too late, ooh (Stop it)
(You better stop)
All the time (Stop it) Right now
Oh stop it (Stop it) Right now
(You better stop right now)
I'm gonna, I'm gonna stop

// When Love Takes Control //

Standing in the pouring rain
Another day that looks the same as yesterday
Thinking bout her all the time
No matter what I do it just won't go away
Like the way she lays her head upon my shoulder
A little piece of heaven when I hold her

When love takes control
There's no escaping
What everyone knows
When love takes its toll
Even though the best of hearts
Yet still we surrender our souls

Just can't seem to let it go
Looking back I should have known we wouldn't last, oh
Fell in love recklessly
Couldn't see that we were moving way too fast, oh
We only knew we had to bond together
That what we had was sure to last forever (Forever) Oh

When love takes control
There's no escaping
What everyone knows
When love takes its toll
Even though the best of hearts
Yet still we surrender our souls

(When love takes control)
When love takes control
(Love takes its toll)
It truly takes its toll now
(When love takes control)
Oh when love takes control
(Love takes its toll)

I don't feel any wiser, only older
It's just the living things I wish I told her (I told her)

When love takes control
Oh, there's no escaping
What everyone knows
When love takes its toll
Even though the best of hearts
Yet still we surrender our souls

(When love takes control)
When love takes control
(Love takes its toll)
Truly takes its toll now
(When love takes control)
Yeah when love takes control
(Love takes its toll)

Takes its toll
Oh, yeah

// After Hours //

That's some sneaky funk from back in the day
Like we used to play after hours, oh yeah

// Can't Stop Thinking About You //

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Living for the moment
I'd do almost anything
No matter how hard it tried
I've just gotten by
Never would've known it
It wasn't my destiny
I felt like I'd fallen apart
Then you came and captured my heart

(Can't stop thinking about you) No, no
Can't get you out of my head
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) You're...
You're always there, I see you everywhere
(Can't stop thinking about you) No-oh
Can't get you out of my head
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) oh, oh, oh-oh
You're always there, I see you everywhere
Woo-ooh

I was just a loner
Drifting from here to there
(Drifting to there)
Each and every plan I made
Turned out bad
Thought I had the answers
I didn't know anything
I felt I was losing control
Then you came and captured my soul

(Can't stop thinking about ya) No
Can't get you out of my head
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) Oh
You're always there, I see you everywhere
(Can't stop thinking about you) Oh, no, no
Can't get you out of my head, no
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) no-oh
You're always there, I see you everywhere
Everywhere

(Can't stop thinking about you) Oh girl
Can't get you out of my head, no, no, no, no, no
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) No matter how hard I try
You're always there, I see you everywhere
(Can't stop thinking about you) Oh
Sweet, sweet baby, I love you so much
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) I just can't help it baby
You're always there, I see you everywhere

(Can't stop thinking about you) No, oh girl
You captured my heart
(No I just can't stop thinking about you) I just don't wanna stay, when I feel this way
(You're always there) somebody help me please
(Can't stop, can't stop) No
(Can't stop, can't stop)
You're always there, I see you everywhere

// East Bay! Oakland Style! //

Gonna get back to the East Bay, all day!
Huh, Oakland all the way, Oakland style
East Bay, all day
Yeah, Oakland all the way!
