// I'll Do For You Anything You Want Me To //

Nothin' and nobody
Baby, could ever take or stop
The love that I have for you
It's very simple, you see it's
Baby, it's real
It's so, so real
What I feel

I'll do for you anything you want me to
You're my world, my hopes and dreams
Without you, girl, it don't mean a thing
For you I'll do anything you want me to
You're my world, my hopes and dreams
Without you, girl, it don't mean a thing

I never thought that I would be knowin'
The kind of love that you have been showin'
The way you do the beautiful things you do
You really know how to make me love you

Uh, ah, can't you see I want it
Ooh, uh, girl, I've been lonely
Ooh, ooh, got to, got to hold you
Ooh, ooh, got to make love to you

Can't you feel the fire
I'm burnin' up from one desire
The thrill from loving you
I can't help myself, I swear it's true

I'll do for you anything you want me to
You're my world, my hopes and dreams
Without you, girl, it don't mean a thing
For you, girl, I'll do anything you want me to
You're my world, my hopes and dreams
And without you, girl, it don't mean a thing

I never thought that I would be feeling
Love so strong for so long and still willin'
To give you all the love I've got to give
For as long, as long as I'm chilling

Uh, ah, can't you see I want it
Uh, uh, girl, I've been lonely
Ooh, ooh, now I got to hold you
Ooh, ooh, gonna make love to you

Girl, I'll go insane
If you ever take
The love I feel for you
I can't help myself, I swear it's true

I'll do, girl, for you anything you want me to
You're my world, my hopes and dreams
Without you, girl, it won't mean a thing
No, no...

I'll do, girl, for you anything you want me to
You're my world, my hopes and dreams
Without you, girl, it don't mean a thing
For you I'll do

// Love Serenade //

Take it off
Baby, take it all off
I wanna see you the way you came into the world
I don't wanna feel no clothes
I don't wanna see no panties
And take off that brassiere, my dear
Everybody's gone
I'm taking the receiver off the phone
Because baby you and me...
This night...
We're gonna get it on
To love serenade...

You know I get in these moods...
Well you know how it is
And I'm very glad to know that you feel the same way too
Baby we're gonna lay here...And we're gonna make love
And we're gonna do it like its supposed to be done
Heaven only knows what goes on behind closed doors
The very depths of our souls will reach out tonight
You and me baby
In love...serenade

Make me want you
Tempt me, tempt me, tempt me
Make me need you
Let me long for you

You'll know what its like when a Man and Woman become One
And the only real way you can do that baby
Is when we're makin' love to each other
When you reach that
That simple feeling when you're makin' love it's..
It's like you're in another world
Help me...
Help me...
Oh baby help me
Lord have mercy on me.

// What Am I Gonna Do With You //

// Let Me Live My Life Lovin' You Babe //

Baby I think we all need to
Take an inventory of
Our love and our feelings
When its involved with that - with that special lady or that special someone.
When I say "we all" I'm talking about all men.
All the brother's around. The Black brothers, the White brothers, the Brown brothers, the Red brothers
Because you know basically all woman are the same.
And we need to, we need to take in consideration that, that woman is
God's greatest gift to man.
And we need to take in consideration that man are then 10x they will be and they will do anything that we want em to.
You know it doesn't take much, than beautiful flowers, a simple card that says "I love you".
Somewhere to be and say "Baby I need you",
You know that's why I'm so in love and so wrapped up in you baby because, I can give you what God gave me.
The only thing that I feel that I really own is the life, that I live and to you I give this life in my love, you know why?
Just because of love I finally knew, I feel this way.
Never had a dream come true, not until the day, you came into my life.
And made it all so sweet.
Girl you did it all.
You did it all for me.
Please...Let me, live my life. Loving you girl. All the rest of my life my life.
Close, to you girl, no one but you girl.
I dedicate my love, you got my heart and soul. Forever.
The greatest story ever told.
How we love each other.
When the people talk, they will smile and say-say
You the only one, who made it all the way
Hey, let me live my life loving you-ou-ou you babe, all the rest of my life
Close to you babe.
Come home...
Let me, honey let me live my life my life my life
Woooh babe woo babe woo babe
I, wish that I could find
Another way to show show,
What I really feel.
How much I love you sooooh
Ooooh, let me live my life, loving you-ou-ou you babe
Rest of my life, close to you babe.
So I give, all that I have to give to you.
But just as long, as you, as you want me to.
Everything baby, the air I breath
The love I need oh
Everything is, everything is you. Only you baby.
Only you.
I guess you could even say its, just another way, to say, I love you.
I need you. I want you.
Let me live my life. Loving you. Rest of my my life, close to you.
Mmmmh baby
Oooooh baby.
