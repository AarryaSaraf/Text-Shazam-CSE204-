Album: ILoveToSingTheSongsISing

// I Love To Sing The Songs I Sing //

I've been around the world
Only to find
Love's universal language

And I knew it all the time

I love to sing the songs
The songs I sing
I sing the songs
I love to sing
I love to sing the songs
The songs I sing
And I sing the songs
I love to sing

This song is for
Is for everyone
I just wanna thanks
For all your time

I love to sing
The songs I sing
And I sing the songs
I love to sing

I love to sing the songs I sing
And I sing the songs
I love to sing
The songs I sing
I love to sing the songs I sing
And I sing the songs
I love to sing

// Girl, What's Your Name //

I've never seen
I never though I've ever see anyone like you
I wanna get next to you
(Yes, I do)

Girl, what's your name?
I wanna get next to you
I swear I do

Pretty girls, girl you such a lovely
You're gonna be my baby
Many things I wanna say
But any word won't do
Got to find something special, special just like you

Girl, what's your name?
I wanna get next to you
I swear I do

I wanna know your name
I wanna get next to you
I swear I do
Pretty girl, you're gonna be mine forever
It's now or never for me

Girl I'm gonna make my move
I'm gonna make my play
I don't intend to lose
You won't get away
Babe!

Girl, what's your name?
I wanna get next to you
I swear I do

// Once Upon A Time (You Were A Friend Of Mine) //

Have you ever had a situation, where...
Where you really wanted something real, real bad?
And as soon as you got it, you... you really didn't know, what to...
What to do with it, how to... how to touch it, how to- how to treat it
Baby, that's very similar to what I'm- to what I'm going through with you
Now that you're here, I'm... I guess I'm so amazed with you here
That I find it hard for me to reach out, and touch you, and hold you, and love you

Once upon a time, did you know, that you were a dream of mine?

All my life I've waited
For someone like you
Now you're here
And I don't know what to say, or do

I'm so afraid to wake up
And find it's all a lie
I wish I could tell you why
You make me feel so shy

Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Wish I could tell you why

What do you say to an angel
Who suddenly appears?
In my dreams it was very, very clear

All that I remember
The way I felt, when I looked in your eyes
I wish I could tell you why
You make me feel so shy

Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Wish I could tell you why

Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Once upon a time...

Why can't I tell you why
You make me feel so shy
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine

Wish I could tell you why
You make me feel so shy
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine

Of mine, of mine
Ooh why, why do I feel so shy?
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine

Oh my
Why do I feel so shy?
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine

I don't know why
You make me feel so shy
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine

Wish I could tell you why
You make me feel so shy
Once upon a time

// Oh Me, Oh My (I'm Such A Lucky Guy) //

Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die

I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
When I wake up
Every morning
You're the sunshine in my eyes
With you girl, I'm a winner
You're my previous prize
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
You ask me why do I love you
There's a million reasons why
But it's so hard for me to tell you
Cause each day they multiply
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Oh me
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Oh me

// I Can't Leave You Alone //

What is this, what's come over me? (oh)
It's only you I want, and only you I see (oh)
Girl, you got me comin' and goin' (oh)
What is this, that just keeps on growing?

I can't leave you alone
Won't somebody please tell me, what's going on?
I can't leave you alone
Am I in despair? I can't tell, 'cause my mind is blown!

Like Humpty Dumpty, on the wall (oh)
I'm slippin' fast, I'm about to fall (oh)
I always had the upper hand (oh)
But now I find myself at your command

I can't leave you alone
Won't somebody please tell me, what's going on?
I can't leave you alone
Am I in despair? I can't tell, 'cause my mind is blown!

I once said, some time ago:
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
"I'll never fall in love, or let my feelings show"
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Look what you've done to me, you changed my mind
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It had to be someone like you, 'cause you're one of a kind

Yeeeahhh...

Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no

(Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no)
I can't, can't leave you alone
(Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no)
Won't somebody please tell me, what's going on?

(Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no)
I can't, can't leave you alone
(Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no)
Won't somebody please tell me, what's going on?
'Cause, ha...

Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no [x6]

// Call Me, Baby //

Sometimes, you... you can get lonely sitting by yourself
And I want you to know something, baby. I want you to know, that...
That I'm always only a phone call away
Whenever you're alone, pick up your phone and call me
Whenever you're in need, you can call me, just call me

Sometimes I sit alone in my room
And all I can think of is you
If you could see how freaky I'd be
I know you'd get freaky too

You're like a ball that's chained to my lump [?]
Girl, I'm the hand that fits in your glove
That's why I need you so
I want you to know

There's something about you
Girl, you stay on my mind
Maybe I'm in love with loving you
When you need me, baby...

Call me
Call me
Call me
Call me, baby

I don't have a pot of gold
Fortune or fame to share with you
You better believe you can count on me
For whatever you want me to do

It's my desire to set your soul on fire
Your whole life through
That's why I need you so
I want you to know

There's something about you
Girl, you stay on my mind
Maybe I'm in love with loving you
When you need me, baby...

Call me
Call me
Call me
Baby, call me

Well, oh yeah

Call me
Call me
Baby, call me
Baby, call me

Call me
Call me
Baby, call me
Oh yeah, call me

Baby, call me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, call me
Call me
Baby, call me
Call me

// How Did You Know It Was Me? //

I know you're in love with me
And I'd do everything for others to see
If it wasn't for you, and the things that you do
I'd be lost as a man could be
Yeah

I'm a star in the public eye
Sometimes when I'm alone, I cry
I live in the light, I'm so tired of the night
I'm a man with nowhere to hide

Oh, how did you know it was me
Who needed your love so badly?
Before you came, my life was a shame
I don't really know, what I'd do without you

How did you know it was me
Who needed your love so badly?
Before you came, my life was a shame
I don't really know, what I would do without you

Some people tell me lies
I never see the truth in their eyes
You see, to them it's just a game
That will leave me in pain
So their real purpose stays disguised

I know you will always be real
And I'd never have to hide what I feel
As long as there's time, I'll be yours, you'll be mine
I need you forever I swear, well

Oh, how did you know it was me
Who needed your love so badly?
Before you came, my life was a shame
I don't really know, what I'd do without you

How did you know it was me
Who needed your love so badly?
Before you came, my life was a shame
I don't really know, what I'd do without you

(How did you know it was me...)

How did I know? [x8]

How did I know?
How did you know, did you know?
How did I know?
How did you know, how did you know?

How did I know?
How did you know, how did you know?
How did I know?
How did you know, how did you know?

How did I know?

How did I know?
How did I, how did I?
[x4]
