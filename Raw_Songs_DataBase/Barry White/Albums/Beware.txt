Album: Beware

// Beware //

I love your style
And I love your smile
I love the way you talk
It's so exiting the way you walk
Beauty is in high when I hold you baby
And I want you to know that all I see is you
And what I see, I like
Girl listen, you're in my life, so:
Beware, I'm gonna get you
Take care, I can't resist you (your touch)
I love you too much
Better beware
I need you, and want you to know dear
I swear I do
I really do dear (your touch)
I love you too much
So beware
I'm not a king on a thrown, no more
No treasures do I own
But if I had your love
I know I'd be
The richest man in history
So beware
I'm gonna get you so take care
Cause I can't resist you (your touch)
I want you too much
So beware
I'm not a king on a thrown, no more
No treasures do I own
But if I had your love
I know I'd be
The richest man in history
So beware
I'm gonna get you so take care
Cause I can't resist you (your touch)
I love you too much
I want you to know
That I love you so
So beware

// Rio De Janeiro //

Have you been there?
Have you been there?
Have you been there?
Have you been there?
What are you talkin about, man?
I'm talkin about Rio, Rio, Rio, Rio.

I've been to Rio de Janeiro.
I love the fun in the sun and the people.
In Rio de Janeiro, it's so exciting to see,
No matter where you go.

Any time, day or night, everything is so alive.
Music there is really hot.
You should see em do the Rio rock.
Nothing like it nowhere else.
It's a feeling that I've never felt.
Never stops, never ends.
It blows your mind just being there.

In Rio de Janeiro,
I love the fun in the sun with the people.
In Rio de Janeiro, its so exciting to see,
No matter where you go.

I went to Sugar Hill the other night.
From the top you see the city lights.
Took the cable car to the other side.
The moon above was big and bright.
Then I saw this huge crowd.
People dancing and singing loud.
People smiled as I walked around.
I felt so good, so I got down.
In Rio, Rio de Janeiro.

// You're My High //

Now getting back to you...

Baby, people all over the world every day
Is trying to find something new
Man putting man into space
In search of some new place
But I'll never, I'll never
Have to worry about leaving here, as...
As long as I've got you

(You're my high)
You're my high... and I swear
(I'll never let you go)
