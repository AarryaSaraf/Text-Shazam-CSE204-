// Sho' You Right //

You know B.W. I've heard it said
I That a woman is a man's greatest git

Sure you're right

And success ain't nothing unless you have someone to share it with

Mmm, so true, so true
I I've always felt that it's great to achieve in life
I Not having someone other than yourself to share it with it is

Sho' you're right

Quite sad

In my case, I may have found someone
I I want, all, of that someone

Yeah, I know what you mean
Well I'll tell you my friend
i Just, communicate with her
And always say what you mean and mean what you say
Because, it's her that you want all of me

Come here baby
Come bring all of you to me
When I say I want all of you
I mean I want all of you from your head to your feet 
I wanna taste everything from your lipstick to your toenail polish

C'mere Kane brother

I want you I want you
I want to hold you, I want to massage you
I want to comfort you, I want to sooth you
You know the way you're standin' still there
I just wanna lay on the floor and make love to your shadow
Sounds silly don't it?

Not really

But for real, let me come on over there
Run my Hngers through your hair
Hold your Nair, and undo that brassiere
My dear

Daddy Kane

Over and over and over

Over and over and over again

Oh I can tell you're serious aren't you?
I'm glad to see that you feelin', this way
That there's somebody in this world that
Make you want to give up that kind of commitment
Love is such a beautiful thing when it's, equally shared

Tell em Maestro

When two people, End the same common ground
They call it, having, so much in common
Making love is one of things that people, these days
Seem to End too common

Communicate B.W

// For Real Chill //

Now, it's our time
You know what I want us to do?
I want us to settle back
Come here, come here and relax
And we'll do all the things that we love to do
Easy
Baby, easy
For real, chill

I remember the first time I saw you
And I was completely blown away
I remember the first time I called you
And what an effect it had on me

I remember what you said when I said to you
"Is it OK to call you there at home?"
And you said, "There's no one in my life at the moment"
I couldn't believe it

For real chill, baby, just be still
I'm gonna stimulate your body and your, your mind
For real chill, and show me how it feels
There's no rush, all we've got is now

The real deal, baby chill
And let me look into those sexy eyes
For real chill, and tell me how this feels
I'm gonna tranquilize your soul with love tonight

The first night we were out together
That was the first time our lips met
I-I-I remember feeling so proud of you lady
Everyone around us were so impressed

The first time we made love together
You were kind of nervous and shy
I remember how you looked at me when I touched you there
It's the same way you're looking now

So for real chill, baby just be still
And let me do it, I'll do it right
Lay still, chill, and tell me how tis feels
I'm gonna saturate your love so good tonight

The real deal, please be still
And let me look into those sexy eyes
Be still, chill, and baby let me feel
Just how wet you're gonna get tonight

I love watching your reaction
Baby, you're so sexy
What is this here? Ah, what is this here?
Something is wet

For real chill, baby just be still
The real deal, be still

Real chill, just lay back and feel
For real chill, baby still
I'm gonna stimulate you tonight

For real chill, and show me how it feels
Good for us, we've got all night
The real deal, baby chill
Oh love

It's gonna be alright
The real deal, baby chill
Gonna be this way all night
Sit back

For real chill, tell me how this feels
I wont give up, until I get it right
Real chill, be still

// Volare //

Penso che un sogno così,na-na non ritornò mai più
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
Rapito!

Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù

E volavo volavo felice
Più in alto del sole
Ed ancora più su
Mentre il mondo
Pian piano spariva lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava
Soltanto per me

Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù

Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù

Let's fly way up in the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find

[2x]
Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù

No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings

// Put Me In Your Mix //

I don't care how you fix it but
Baby, put me in your mix

All you've ever wanted
Or how you wanted or where you want it

I'm waiting patiently
Hoping that I can be in your mix
It's you that I adore
Just wait, there's so much more in my mix
Sweet as honey it can be
But you're the lock and you're the key

Smooth as honey it will be
And I love you with dignity
I wanna be with you so much
I wanna feel the way you touch
All the love you need is here
No more lies and no more tears

// Who You Giving Your Love To //

All is she can tell me is love
This is so important that I need to know
It's now or never
How she stands?
What's going on?
Excuse me, can I have a minute of your time please?
But I need to say this
I've seen you many times before
And each I've seen you
You've been alone
And I was just wondering (I was wondering if I)
If I, if I could share this with you
[?]
Somebody wants to get close to you
Oh, I can't take another night or another day
Without asking you face to face

Could you tell me?
Will you tell me

Who, who you giving your love to?
Who, who is spending time with?
I need to know, I really need to know
Who, who you giving your love to?
Tell me baby, I really need to know

I need it badly

In solitute as I lay awake in bed
So many fantasies of ectasy, fills my head
[?]
Your personality, hmm
Your such a lady, hmm
Oh, this dream I know it sounds insane
I know so insane
But you make me feel just so strange
Every word I said is true

Be my lady

Would you tell me?
Baby, could you tell me?

Girl, who's getting all that

// Love Will Find Us //

Patience
Always, be patient
The way we make love
We take our time
Really get into each others feelings
It takes time, to touch and feel
Hold and kiss and look
Takes time
And when you take your time
Make love in a very passionate way
You tend to enjoys so much more
We really have to be careful sweetheart
So many times if've seen people trying to rush
Certain thangs into their lives
Some plays in to delay a woman
Turnout to be a disaster
I've lived long enough to understand
All things comes in time
We must always nourish this relationship
Always spend being time together communicating and relating
Because nothings ever guarenteed, other then
Your gonna stay the colour you are
One day you'll die
Outside of that, nah
You have to work while you wait
And remember no matter what it is
Whether it's us
Something you want to achieve in your life
Baby if it's meant for you, for me, for us
We're gonna have it, you can believe
Whatever we achieve to it
Will come with time

Love will find us along the way
If we stay together
Love will find us, if we stay
Lock in to each other
Love will find us, if we wait
Baby let's not hurry
Love will find us if we make
Make time for each other

It's very truth
Baby it's very real
It's life itself
No matter who you are, where you are
What's you trying to do in life
The same game applies to everyone
If you can see then and believe it
You can not do it, but it's harder
Take time

Love will find us along the way
If we stay together
Love will find us, if we stay
Lock in to each other
Love will find us, if we wait
Baby let's not hurry
Love will find us if we make
Make time for each other

We're searching for something
Very, very special
And we have to keep working and searching
Searching working
All things in time

Love will find us along the way
If we stay together
Love will find us, if we stay
Lock in to each other
Love will find us, if we wait
Baby let's not hurry
Love will find us if we make
Make time for each other

// We're Gonna Have It All //

What do you want, what are you looking for?
You want to be loved, you want to be cared for?
You want motivation, you need communication?

Oh I can search a lifetime and never see,
The one can do the things, you do to me.

We're gonna have it all, through Winter Spring
All, the wonderful things, Summer and fall,

You were made for gentleness, you were made so sweet
You were made for tenderness, you were made for me,
