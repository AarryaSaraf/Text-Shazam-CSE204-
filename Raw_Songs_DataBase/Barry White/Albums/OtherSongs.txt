// Ain't No Sunshine //

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
It's not warm when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
And she's always gone to long. 
Anytime she goes away.

Wonder this time where she's gone. 
Wonder if she's gone to stay.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
And this house just ain't no home.
Anytime she goes away.

I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
Gotta leave the young thing alone

There ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
Only darkness every day. 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
And this house just ain't no home. 
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.

// All Around The World //

I don't know where my baby is
But I'll find him, somewhere, somehow
I've got to let him know how much I care
I'll never give up looking for my baby

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

We had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was oh oh so bad
And I don't think he's comin' back, mm mm

He gave the reason, the reasons he should go
And he said so many things he never said before
And he was oh oh so mad
And I don't think he's comin', comin' back

I did too much lyin', wasted too much time,
Now I'm here a'cryin', I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

So open hearted, he never did me wrong
I was the one, the weakest one of all
And now I'm oh oh so sad
And I don't think he's comin' back, comin' back

I did too much lyin', wasted too much time,
Now I'm here a'cryin', I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

I'm gonna find him, my baby

I did too much lyin', wasted too much time,
Now I'm here a'cryin', I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

I've been around the world, lookin' from my baby
Been around the world, and I'm gonna
I'm gonna find him

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

// All Of Me //

Let's get busy, Daddy Kane

You know, BW, I've heard it's said
That a woman is a man's greatest gift
Sure, you're right

And the success ain't nothin'
Unless you have someone to share it with
Hmm, so true, so true

I've always felt like it's great to achieve in life
Without having someone other than yourself
To share what it is
Sure you're right, quite sane

In my case I may have found someone
I want all of that someone
Yeah, I know what you mean

Well, I tell you, my friend, just communicate with her
And always say what you mean, mean what you say
Because it's her that you are all about

Come here, baby, come bring all of you to me
When I say I want all of you
I mean I want all of you
From your head to your feet

I wanna taste everything
From your lipstick to your toe nail polish
Communicate, brother

I want you, I want to
I wanna hold you, I wanna massage you
I wanna comfort you, I wanna soothe you

You know the way you're standing still there
I wanna just lay on the floor
And make love your shadow
Sounds silly, don't it? Not really

But for real, let me come on over there
Run my fingers through your hair
Hold you near and undo that brassiere, my dear
Because tonight, girl, all of me wants all of you

Baby, all of me wants all of you
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
Over and over and over
Let's do it now and show me how
Over and over and over again

You know I can tell you're serious, aren't you?
And I'm glad to see that you're feeling this way
That there's somebody in this world who can
Make you wanna give up that kind of commitment

Love is such a beautiful thing when it's equally shared
Tell 'em, maestro
When two people find the same common ground
They call it havin' so much in common

Makin' love is one of those things
That people these days seem to find in common
Communicate, BW, sure you're right

So I want you to know that I really feel
That you're gonna make it all the way
With this young lady
You got my love, my respect
[?] young man [?]

Baby, all of me wants all of you
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
Over and over and over
Let's do it now and show me how
Over and over and over again

Baby, all of me wants all of you
Let's start tonight, sure you're right
Over and over and over
I want it now and show me how
Over and over and over again

Baby, all of me wants all of you
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
Over and over and over
Let's do it now

// Baby Blues //

Certain things turn me on
Like the way you might say a word or
The way you wear your hair
You have a certain smile on your face

By just the way you're standing there right now
Now you really, really, really, look good to me, baby
In your baby blue panties, yes love, you look good to me right now
In your baby blues, them baby blues and you

// Ella Es Todo Para Mi (She's Everything To Me) //

Señor ten piedad para mi corazón
Que esta lleno de amor tanto amor
Por eso te hablo porque sabes que hay
En mi mente y en mi corazón
Señor dame lo que necesito para amar
Y dame lo que debo tener para que se quede a mi lado
Ella es todo para mi

Las palabras no bastan
Para mi no bastan
Quiero decir que no estoy seguro
De estar haciendo todo lo que puedo
Que soy todo lo que podría ser
Para que ella entienda que nuestro amor es para siempre
Tu sabes que ella es todo para mi

Mente suprema de todas las mentes
Poder de los poderes
Grandezas de las grandezas
Por favor escucha mi llanto de amor
Llename de visión, corazón y verdad
Ella es todo
Ella es todo
Ella es todo
Ella es todo para mi

Es mi día
Mi noche
Mi alegría
Mi vida
Ella es todo

// Love's Theme //

Play our love's theme tonight
My love's here, it's no dream tonight
It's been so long
Since we've danced to our love song
I know the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me (love's theme)

Play our love's theme once more
Make him feel, like he felt before
While the lights are low
Please, let the music flow
I know that the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me (love's theme)

Play our love's theme again
Touch his heart, touch his soul and then
Once we sip the wine
His lips will come to mine
I know that the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me
Love's theme...

// You're What's On My Mind //

Make my night
Sho' you right
What this night holds for us?
Baby, only the angels in heaven can speak it
We'll embrace love like never before
Or anyone has ever known it

Baby, you're what's on my mind...
Heh, that's right, that's right! 
That's right, that's right

(I think about you all the time)
Woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo-woo
I want you, I need you
Oh love, oh love, yeah yeah

(You're what's on my mind
I think about you all the time
I think about you every day)
Oh, yes I do!
(Love will make you feel brand new)

I can sense a feel, here and now
You're gonna give your love to me
Say kesu [?], won't you too
And so very [?], won't you marry me?

Come with me, and we'll share
Our sensual secret
Let's explore, open every door
Until we can't take anymore

Loving you, that's on my mind
I swear it's there
I think about it all the time
I, I... (awooo!)

I want to do it night and day
With you, to you
Love can make you feel that way

(You're what's on my mind)
There it is
(I think about you every day
Love will make you feel brand new...)
