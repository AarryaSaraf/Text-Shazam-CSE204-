Can I share this with you?
Baby, you know imagination is really funny
Sometimes it's very hard to do, it's... impossible
Many nights and days, I... I've tried to imagine, what it would be like to love you
I've even tried to imagine, what you would look like, being loved
And I, I... I can't do it
I'm trying to do what a gentleman would do
Trying to be patient and tolerant, all the things that a man is supposed to be
But... I just wanted you to know very honestly, that I'm very anxious to be with you

It's getting harder all the time
Just to keep myself from wanting you
Harder every day, for me to stay away
Knowing, girl without your loving
I ain't worth one dime
It's getting harder, harder all the time
All the time
It's getting hard every night
Just to keep my hands from touching you
Oh darling, what am I to do 
And I hear you sigh
I might as well kiss my poor heart goodbye
And start to cry
It's getting harder, harder all the time
All the time
There's no fighting what I feel
Oh, God knows, I've tried
Tried to hold back my love from you
It's like trying to hold back the tide
It's getting harder, harder, harder all the time
I can't stop needing you
Oh, harder every day, for me to find a away
To keep myself from the tenderness
Of your lips touching mine
It's getting harder, harder all the time
All the time

I ain't worth a dime
It's getting harder, harder all the time
Harder, harder all the time
I need your lips close to mine...
