Don't think...just feel it
Ooooh...just do it

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

Anytime is the right time 
To share your love with me
And baby, in the meantime
I'll be waiting anciously

I'm in the mood to make sweet love to you
It's always on my mind, babe
All of the things you love me to do
I'm gonna make it nice, I'm gonna make it right

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

I'm in the same situation
I need you more and more each day
Seems when you're not around me
Oh, so very far away
And I'm in the mood to give sweet love to you
Girl, that's always on my mind
And all the things you want me to do
Turn out the light, I'll make it right

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The longer we do it, the more we get down to it

I'm in the mood to make sweet love to you
It's always on my mind, babe
All of the things you love me to do
I'm gonna make it nice, I'm gonna make it right

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me
