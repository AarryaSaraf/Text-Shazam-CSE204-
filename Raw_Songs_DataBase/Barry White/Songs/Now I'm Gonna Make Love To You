Get ready
Get ready
Get ready
Get ready

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
Gonna get it, gonna get it

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
Gonna get it, gonna get it

Remember what I told you?
Now I'm gonna show you
How much I need
This love you're giving me

Forgive me, baby
But ooh, you're such a pretty lady
When I look at you
The things I wanna do

The lights are out, the music low
The time has come, and now you will know
What it is about you
Why I can't live without you
It's so good, you're so fine
Unreal, all mine

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it

Now I'm gonna make love to you
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
I'm gonna get it, gonna get it

Nice and easy does it
Ooh, it's how I love it
This night belongs
To you and me alone

Pay no attention
If I happen to mention
How good it feels
To feel the chills I feel

If you go first, before I do
It won't be long, and I'll be that too
That's the way I feel about you
That's why I can't live without you
It's so good, you're so fine
Unreal, all mine!

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
I'm gonna get it, gonna get it

Sha-la-la-la...

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
Gonna get it, gonna get it

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, I'm gonna get it

Sha-na-na-na...

Now I'm gonna make love to you
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it...
