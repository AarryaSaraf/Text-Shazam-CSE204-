What do you want, what are you looking for?
You want to be loved, you want to be cared for?
You want motivation, you need communication?
Well, all that's here, here yeah baby;

Mmmm right here baby share your life with me,
And share your time with me, share your love with me.
And baby we can have it all,

You were made to love, you were made to hold,
You were made to love, and not control,
Oh I can search a lifetime and never see,
The one can do the things, you do to me.

We're gonna have it all, we're coming on the wall,
We're gonna have it all, through Winter Spring
All, the wonderful things, Summer and fall,

You were made for gentleness, you were made so sweet
You were made for tenderness, you were made for me,
I can look a life time and still not find,
The reason I'm so lucky, you devastate my mind;

We're gonna have it all, we're gonna get off the wall,
You know we're gonna have it all, we're coming off the wall,
We're gonna have, yea, were gonna have, all the dreams,
We're gonna have, communicate, we're gonna have, and totally relate,
You know were gonna have it all, I mean it all, yeah,

We're gonna have it all, through winters and springs, summer and fall, share, care
Understanding, honesty, consistency, loyalty, everything;

Baby and I mean everything, were gonna have it all,
We're coming off the wall, we're gonna have, we're gonna have, love
