I need love
I need life
I need to know that
That I have someone that I can love
Baby, you're the one
The one I need

Can you make me feel the way I think you can
And girl, can you make me realize how good it is to be a man

Can you take the cold nights and make them seem so warm
Can you unfold mysteries and thrill me with all your charm

You're the one, you're the one I need
You're the one, you're the one I need
Girl, you're the on, you're the one I need
Girl, you're the on, you're the one I need

Is it possible for you to see the mistake I've surely made
Give me an accept for each one so I can make the grade

Girl can you see it's love I need
Can you see these things
And if you could, would you tell me

You're the one, you're the one I need
Girl, you're the on, you're the one I need

You're the one, you're the one I need
