All I wanna do is to always be there for you
To love you, need you and keep you
Baby that's all I wanna do

Don't play games, trying to be quick (never)
and trying to be slick (ever)
Don't play games, aw it makes a mess
And all you get is pain

Baby we can do this, baby we should try
So let's jump right in to it
Let's make that move tonight
No don't play games, tryin' to be sly
It's not smart, it's not wise  

No don't play games, it makes a mess
And all you get is pain
Now it's gonna be a challenge
Love is so unique, yeah
It all hangs in the balance 
And girl we hold the key

I know we can do this
Baby we should try
Now let's jump right into it
Let's make that move 
Let's make that move tonight

No don't play games, trying to be quick
And tryin' to be slick
No don't play games, tryin' to be sly
It's not smart, it's not wise,
Don't play games, it makes a mess 
And all you get is pain
Don't play games, tryin' sly 
It's not smart, it's not wise

Don't play games, don't do it baby
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it babe
Don't do it, don't do it, no don't do it
No don't do it, don't do it babe
Don't do it babe, no don't do it babe
Don't play games, no don't play games
Baby don't play games, no don't play games
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it
