Your eyes... are the most beautiful eyes
And I can see a tiny little light, shining bright from your eyes
Sexy, sensual eyes... they say it all. The way you look at me...
Baby, I start to feel something moving and stirring inside of me
Can you feel it too? Can you?

You're like a dream in a movie scene
The part when your eyes can't leave the stream
A kiss in the dark, and you stole my heart
Oh love

I love how it feels, exploding inside
I've never ever felt this way in my life
I want you so, and want you to know

Baby, in your eyes I can see the morning light
Endless paradise, as we're moving through the night
Love is in your eyes, I can see the morning light
Endless paradise, gently moving through the night
Oh, oh, oh...

One of a kind, you're simply divine
Sending those shockwaves through my mind
Holding you close, I need you the most

Baby, in your eyes I can see the morning light
Endless paradise, as we're moving through the night
Love is in your eyes, I can see the morning light
Endless paradise, gently moving through the night
Oh, oh, oh...

It's in your eyes, they say you're gonna be with me
But not just tonight, yes I can see
That maybe it's forever
All the way - that's the only way I play
The time is so right, for you and I
To fly away on golden wings of love

Baby, in your eyes I can see the morning light
Endless paradise, as we're moving through the night
Love is in our arms, can't you see the morning light
Endless paradise, gently moving through the night
Oh, no, no...

Love is in your eyes, I see that morning light
Endless paradise, making love all through the night
In your eyes, in your eyes, it's in your eyes...
Tonight, that light, so bright, shining bright...
Your eyes, so bright...
It's all there, in your eyes...

It's in your eyes... stay and be with me
Stay here, close to me
