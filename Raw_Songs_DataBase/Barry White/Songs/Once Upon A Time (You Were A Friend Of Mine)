Have you ever had a situation, where...
Where you really wanted something real, real bad?
And as soon as you got it, you... you really didn't know, what to...
What to do with it, how to... how to touch it, how to- how to treat it
Baby, that's very similar to what I'm- to what I'm going through with you
Now that you're here, I'm... I guess I'm so amazed with you here
That I find it hard for me to reach out, and touch you, and hold you, and love you

Once upon a time, did you know, that you were a dream of mine?

All my life I've waited
For someone like you
Now you're here
And I don't know what to say, or do

I'm so afraid to wake up
And find it's all a lie
I wish I could tell you why
You make me feel so shy

Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Wish I could tell you why

What do you say to an angel
Who suddenly appears?
In my dreams it was very, very clear

All that I remember
The way I felt, when I looked in your eyes
I wish I could tell you why
You make me feel so shy

Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Wish I could tell you why

Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine
Once upon a time...

Why can't I tell you why
You make me feel so shy
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine

Wish I could tell you why
You make me feel so shy
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine

Of mine, of mine
Ooh why, why do I feel so shy?
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine

Oh my
Why do I feel so shy?
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine

I don't know why
You make me feel so shy
Once upon a time
You were a dream of mine

Wish I could tell you why
You make me feel so shy
Once upon a time
