How many times baby have you heard people say that nothing good comes easy
Tell me how many times do we sit amongst our friends making up and breaking up
just trying to get their lives together
As simple as the word love is its,
its not easy for two people to feel and touch and hold and need each other,
its how bad we really want it
Whatever the mind can conceive, its possible
Love ain't easy baby, love ain't easy

We're so perfect for each other,
Still you have some doubts
You're holding back your love girl,
Just in case it don't workout

Yeah we know love ain't easy
Something no one can deny
But we'll never know if we can make it
We wont longer knock until we try
We wont know until we try

You, you say love is a gamble,
Well nothing guarantee
But if we give our love a chance girl,
Girl I bet we will succeed.

Yeah we know love ain't easy
That something no one can deny
But we'll never know if we can make it
We wont longer knock until we try
We just wont know until we try

He's gonna blow for...
Love ain't easy
Love ain't easy
We just wont know until we try
Let him blow some more for...
Love ain't easy
Love ain't easy
We just wont know until we try

Yeah we know love ain't easy
That something no one can deny
But we'll never know if we can make it
We wont longer knock until we try
We just wont know until we try

Love ain't easy
It ain't easy
Love ain't easy
It ain't easy
Love ain't easy
It ain't easy
Love ain't easy
It ain't easy...
