You know, we really can't afford to wait any longer
For only we have the power to change anything
The future lies on our children
Give them hope... save them

It's your time, it's your life, up to you, do it right
(Follow it and see, where it leads y'all)
You're the power and the source, use your positive force
(Follow it and see)
From your shoulders that you earn, from the shoulders that you learn
(Follow it and see, where it leads y'all)
Almighty God is deep in your heart
(Follow it and see)

Every nation's sound down  are people
(It's the people)
Let's not dog in, let's stop causing pain
(Yeeeah)
Let's take all that power and concentration
(From the children)
And teach our children truth and better gains
It's insane!

We stifle our nation with false education
Just follow it and see (where it leads y'all)
We can fool them all the day, tomorrow we will pay
(Follow it and see)
We teach them power and wealth - it's all for yourself
(Follow it and see, where it leads y'all)
Material things don't mean spiritual gain
(Follow it and see)
It's your time, it's your life, up to you, do it right
(Follow it and see, where it leads y'all)
Through the panic and discreet truth will always set you free
(Follow it and see)

We don't have much time to go together
To change the things we let go on for so long (for so long)
Only we can stop this devastation (believe it)
If we don't (if we don't) this will o- (this will o-) -nly go on

It's your time, it's your life, up to you, do it right
(Follow it and see, where that leads y'all)
Through the manic and the key truth will always set you free
(Follow it and see)
The ocean's another place for dumping our poison waste
(Follow it and see, where that leads y'all)
People dying all around, water poisoning the ground
(Follow it and see)
It's your time, it's your life, up to you, do it right
(Follow it and see, where that leads y'all)
You're the power and the source, use your positive force
(Follow it and see)

(Follow it and see, where that leads y'all)
(Follow it and see)

We are the landlords... yes, everything on this Earth is in our care.
We must stop this asinine madness of destroying so many things
And causing so much devastation, everywhere.

It's your time, it's your life, up to you, do it right
(Follow that and see, where that leads y'all)
Follow it and see
Following beacon light, you won't know until you try
(Follow that and see, where that leads y'all)
Almighty God is deep in your heart
(Follow that and see)
No more pranks, no more games, all heroes are the same
(Follow that and see)
Following beacon light, you won't know until you try
(Follow that and see)
Oh lord, yeah yeah, yeah...
(Follow that and see, where it leads y'all)
All night, it's gonna be alright...
