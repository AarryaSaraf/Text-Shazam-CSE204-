I'm still waiting for you to answer that question: when?
You know, when we're sitting there right now, we can almost...
Baby, I can almost read your mind
You just gonna let me suffer, right?
I want the answer to that question
When will I love you again?
Baby, when will I see you again?

Staring aptly  into sunlight
Turning daytime into night, tonight
Thoughts of raging passion and feeling
Wanting more and still believing, yeah yeah
Building all and having nothing
Living, but not really learning

When will I hold you, when will I see you again, again
When will I hold you, when will I see you again, again
When will I hold you, girl I want to know you again, again
And when will I see you, girl I really need you again, again

Love is learning, never teaching
Climbing stairs that keeps on reaching
Higher, and higher
Life is made of right and wrongings
It's funny how we get so confused
Living in the world and finding
My inner feelings, there's no hiding
Sitting here and feeling lonely
Wishing I could hold you only

When will I hold you, when will I see you again, again
When will I see you, girl I really need you again, again

You're teasing me... you know what you're doing
You know what you're doing
I think you love to tease me... please me

Staring aptly  into sunlight
Turning daytime into night, tonight
Knowing but not understanding
Giving all and still demanding
Fire burning inside ice cubes
Feel the beat but lose the groove
Yeah, alright

When will I hold you, when will I see you again, again
When will I hold you, girl I want to know you again
And again, and again, and again
When will I see you, girl I really need you again, again
When will I hold you, girl I want to know you again
Well, well
