Has it come to this?
After all the love we've shared together
And all the love we've known together
Tell me, has it come to this?
Baby we're sitting here together and yet, and yet it's not the same
Because here in my heart I'm very sad
I feel so bad

Now I'm so blue
And you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?
I'm blue
And you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?

Oh, what sense does, does it make
For us to break, our hearts in two
Love is still the answer, for me
My darling, and you

I'm so blue
And you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?
I'm blue
And you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?

Nothing good come easy
And that means our love too
If it's worth having, it's worth keeping
After all, look at what we been through

This is not the way, this is not the way for us baby
We know how to make it right
And we know how to make it strong
And now we gotta get it back, where it belongs

I'm blue
You are too
Love, oh, what a shame
Girl what can we do?
I'm blue
And you are too
What a shame
What can we do?

Love is still the answer for me my darling
You, are blue
Girl you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?
Love, I'm blue
And you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?

My, I'm blue
You are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we, what can we do about it?
My, my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, my, my
