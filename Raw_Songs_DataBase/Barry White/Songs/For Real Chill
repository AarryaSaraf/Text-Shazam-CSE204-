Now, it's our time
You know what I want us to do?
I want us to settle back
Come here, come here and relax
And we'll do all the things that we love to do
Easy
Baby, easy
For real, chill

I remember the first time I saw you
And I was completely blown away
I remember the first time I called you
And what an effect it had on me

I remember what you said when I said to you
"Is it OK to call you there at home?"
And you said, "There's no one in my life at the moment"
I couldn't believe it

For real chill, baby, just be still
I'm gonna stimulate your body and your, your mind
For real chill, and show me how it feels
There's no rush, all we've got is now

The real deal, baby chill
And let me look into those sexy eyes
For real chill, and tell me how this feels
I'm gonna tranquilize your soul with love tonight

The first night we were out together
That was the first time our lips met
I-I-I remember feeling so proud of you lady
Everyone around us were so impressed

The first time we made love together
You were kind of nervous and shy
I remember how you looked at me when I touched you there
It's the same way you're looking now

So for real chill, baby just be still
And let me do it, I'll do it right
Lay still, chill, and tell me how tis feels
I'm gonna saturate your love so good tonight

The real deal, please be still
And let me look into those sexy eyes
Be still, chill, and baby let me feel
Just how wet you're gonna get tonight

I love watching your reaction
Baby, you're so sexy
What is this here? Ah, what is this here?
Something is wet

For real chill, baby just be still
The real deal, be still

Real chill, just lay back and feel
For real chill, baby still
I'm gonna stimulate you tonight

For real chill, and show me how it feels
Good for us, we've got all night
The real deal, baby chill
Oh love

It's gonna be alright
The real deal, baby chill
Gonna be this way all night
Sit back

For real chill, tell me how this feels
I wont give up, until I get it right
Real chill, be still
