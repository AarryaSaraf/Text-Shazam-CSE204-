As we turn the pages of our history, since America began
Many women, boys and girls of all nationalities and walks of life
Have been committed to the freedom of America

"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God
Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"

America, what are we waiting for?
America...
(America, America)
...what are we created for?

I remember so well:
You said "God shed his grace on thee
And in this land all men shall be free"

When I was a boy - "one nation under God", you taught me
"Liberty and justice, it's for all"
But the writing's on the wall
Justice for some, but not for all

I wanna know, I wanna know
America
We've always done our part (well...) to keep America free
What are we waiting for?
We gave our lives in every war: from the air, on land, and sea
America...
I thought freedom for America meant freedom for me
...what are we created for?
America...
I wanna know
...what are we waiting for?

Every way you turn
People hurt, people say
All across the land
You're gonna know
Hungry and cold people there

But where's all the compensation, we...
We're tied up in all the lies and games
With ourselves 
Without twilight it don't mean a thing
And that's a sad damn shame

People got to pay
People got to pay for change

America
What are we waiting for?

" ...47 years ago, our fathers fought for this continent
And new nation could seek in liberty and dedicate it to proposition
That all men are created equal"

America
What are we waiting for?
I wanna know, I wanna know
America
Mhm, yeah yeah
What are we created for?
I wanna know... oooowww

America
Human rights? Huh, for every woman, man, boy, girl
Black or white
America...
America, America
...what are we created for?
I wanna know... aaahh-wwhoo!
Somebody, please!
(America) I wanna know, I wanna know
What are we waiting for?
America...
