Baby you know I'm nasty by nature (evil laugh)
Just when you thought that it was safe
I'll come along with a new twist
I'll share my wildest fantasies
You never thought it'd be like this
Oh no, any time and any place
Oh yes, so good time won't go to waste
Oh no, every day's a little treat
It could be loud or discreet
I know you can't tell from the outside
But baby there is plenty in store
You know I'm as shy as they come girl
Until I get behind closed doors

I'm your sexy undercover
Girl I've known just what, what you like
Your one and only lover
I'll surprise you girl every time (sexy)
Girl I never want to be alone 
It's like ice cream without the cone
One without the other 
It just wouldn't taste right oh no

Any time and any place oh yes
So good time won't go to waste oh oh no
Every day's a little treat
It could be loud or discreet oh yes

I know you can't tell from the outside
But baby there is plenty in store
You'll never know I'm as quiet as they come girl
Until I get behind closed doors
Then I'm yours
I'm your sexy undercover
Girl I've known just what you like
Your one and only lover
I'll surprise you girl every time (sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy)
Sexy undercover, (I can't get enough of your love babe)
So on and so on sexy, sexy, ha sexy
I know you can't tell from the outside (know what I'm saying)
But baby there is plenty in store
You know I'm as quiet as they come girl
Until I get behind closed doors
Sexy undercover
I'll surprise you girl every time 
Your one and only lover
I'll come up with it every time
Sexy undercover
Girl I know what you like
Your one and only lover
I'll come up with it every time (sexy)
Sexy undercover
