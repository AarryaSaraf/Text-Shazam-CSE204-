- Can I have this dance?
- Is it all right?
- Yeah, it's all right. As long as you ain't slowdancing, junior

She's on the floor, baby do it
Right on time, really into it
I don't believe what I see
Blowin' my mind, killing me

(Look at her...)
The way she moves, look at her
(Look at her...)
The way she grooves, look at her

Looking sharp, steppin' high
Sexy moves, watch her fly
Music turned up so loud
Clappin' hands, screaming crowd
Body heat fills the room
Madness will explode soon
I don't believe what I see
Blowin' my mind, killing me

(Look at her...)
The way she moves, look at her
(Look at her...)
The way she grooves, look at her
(Look at her...)
The way she moves, look at her
(Look at her...)
The way she grooves, look at her

All right, all right, all right

(Look at her...)
