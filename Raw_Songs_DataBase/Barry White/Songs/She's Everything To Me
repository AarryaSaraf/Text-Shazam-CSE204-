Lord have mercy
For my heart is full of love
So much love
And yet, I know that man can't
Live by love alone (she's everything)
So I call on you (she's everything to me)
Because you know my mind (she's everything)
And my heart (she's everything to me)
Give me everything I need (she's everything)
To love her... (she's everything to me)
(She's everything) And give me everything
(She's everything to me) I must have to...
(She's everything) To keep her
(She's everything to me)
(She's everything) She's everything to me

Words are just not enough...
(She's everything) To me, it's just not enough
(She's everything to me)
(She's everything) I mean, I'm not sure if I'm doing
Everything I can (She's everything to me)
To make her understand that (She's everything)
(She's everything to me) Our love is everlasting
(She's everything) And I've got to be sure
(She's everything to me)
(She's everything) I have to know that
(She's everything to me) That I'm doing everything that I should do
(She's everything)
(She's everything to me) That I'm being everything that I should be
(She's everything) You know, she's everything to me

Supreme Mind of all Minds
Power of all Power
Greatness of all Greatness
Please hear my cry for love
And strengthen me
With wisdom, vision
(She's everything) Heart and soul
(She's everything to me) Truth and understanding...
(She's everything) She's everything
(She's everything to me) She's everything
(She's everything) She's everything
(She's everything to me) To me

(She's everything) She's my day
(She's everything to me) She's my night
(She's everything) She's my joy
(She's everything to me) She's my life
(She's everything)
(She's everything to me)
(She's everything)
(She's everything to me)
(She's everything)
(She's everything to me)
(She's everything)
(She's everything to me)
