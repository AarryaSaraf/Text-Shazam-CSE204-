I know you're in love with me
And I'd do everything for others to see
If it wasn't for you, and the things that you do
I'd be lost as a man could be
Yeah

I'm a star in the public eye
Sometimes when I'm alone, I cry
I live in the light, I'm so tired of the night
I'm a man with nowhere to hide

Oh, how did you know it was me
Who needed your love so badly?
Before you came, my life was a shame
I don't really know, what I'd do without you

How did you know it was me
Who needed your love so badly?
Before you came, my life was a shame
I don't really know, what I would do without you

Some people tell me lies
I never see the truth in their eyes
You see, to them it's just a game
That will leave me in pain
So their real purpose stays disguised

I know you will always be real
And I'd never have to hide what I feel
As long as there's time, I'll be yours, you'll be mine
I need you forever I swear, well

Oh, how did you know it was me
Who needed your love so badly?
Before you came, my life was a shame
I don't really know, what I'd do without you

How did you know it was me
Who needed your love so badly?
Before you came, my life was a shame
I don't really know, what I'd do without you

(How did you know it was me...)

How did I know? 
How did I know? 
How did I know? 
How did I know? 
How did I know? 
How did I know? 
How did I know? 
How did I know? 


How did I know?
How did you know, did you know?
How did I know?
How did you know, how did you know?

How did I know?
How did you know, how did you know?
How did I know?
How did you know, how did you know?

How did I know?

How did I know?
How did I, how did I?
