I've never seen
I never though I've ever see anyone like you
I wanna get next to you
(Yes, I do)

Girl, what's your name?
I wanna get next to you
I swear I do

Pretty girls, girl you such a lovely
You're gonna be my baby
Many things I wanna say
But any word won't do
Got to find something special, special just like you

Girl, what's your name?
I wanna get next to you
I swear I do

I wanna know your name
I wanna get next to you
I swear I do
Pretty girl, you're gonna be mine forever
It's now or never for me

Girl I'm gonna make my move
I'm gonna make my play
I don't intend to lose
You won't get away
Babe!

Girl, what's your name?
I wanna get next to you
I swear I do
