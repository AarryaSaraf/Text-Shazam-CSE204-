When we make sweet lovin', baby
You whisper things, that blows my mind
It really makes me feel that we are
In another place and time
No other love I've found
Could make my head go 'round and 'round
Hey baby, hey baby...

When you're huggin', squeezin', teasin'
Chills rushes up and down my spine
It's so wonderful to share
The magic both yours and mine
No other love I've known
Has been this good and felt so strong
Hey baby, hey baby...

No, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Look all around us
Love has truly found us
Ooh no, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Believe me when I say
I love you more and more each day
Yeah...

No other love I've found
Could make my head go 'round and 'round
No baby, hey baby...

No, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Look all around us
I'm so glad love has found us
Ooh no, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Believe me when I say
I love you more and more each day
No, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Look all around us
Love has truly found us
Oh no, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Believe me when I say
I love you more and more each day

No, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Just look around us
Look at what love has brought us
Oh no, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Believe me when I say
I love you more and more each day
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh no, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
No, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Oh no, we can't let go
We can't let go of love...
