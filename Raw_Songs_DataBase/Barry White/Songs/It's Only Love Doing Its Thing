It's only love
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love

Don't be afraid to touch me babe
Girl let's be real, there's nothing wrong
With the way we're carrying on
So enjoy and live

Because
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're feeling
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're giving

I wanna stay with you night and day
Until the end of time
It's okay when you lay
Lay your body next to mine

Because
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're feeling
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're giving, giving

I wanna stay with you night and day
Until the end of time
It's okay when you lay
Lay your body next to mine

Because
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're feeling
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're giving, yea

It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're feeling
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're giving

It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're feeling
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're giving

It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're feeling
It's only love doing its thing baby
