It's time
I'm sincere, I say what I mean
And I mean just what I say
I've, I've never felt like this
Loving so hard, so deep, so quick
Babe look into my eyes
And all I see is you
And if you agree to be with me
No lies, no games, no tricks

I hope you're feeling the way I do
And I hope you need it
Needing my love the way I need you

The time is right, right now
Give your love to me
Let me show you how

I've always knew darling
It would take a very very special lady for me
The first time I saw you
You were everything I wanted
And everything I need

I hope you're feeling the way I do
And I hope you're reaching
Reach out to me I'm reaching for you
The time is right, share it share it
right now
Give your love to me
Let me show you how
The time is right, right now
Give it all to me
Let me show you how

The time is right, the time is now
Give it all to me
Let me show you how

The time is right, right now
Give your love to me
The time is right,

The time is right, the time is now
Give it all to me
Let me show you how
The time is right,
Let me show you
