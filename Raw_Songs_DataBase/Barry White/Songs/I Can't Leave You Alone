What is this, what's come over me? (oh)
It's only you I want, and only you I see (oh)
Girl, you got me comin' and goin' (oh)
What is this, that just keeps on growing?

I can't leave you alone
Won't somebody please tell me, what's going on?
I can't leave you alone
Am I in despair? I can't tell, 'cause my mind is blown!

Like Humpty Dumpty, on the wall (oh)
I'm slippin' fast, I'm about to fall (oh)
I always had the upper hand (oh)
But now I find myself at your command

I can't leave you alone
Won't somebody please tell me, what's going on?
I can't leave you alone
Am I in despair? I can't tell, 'cause my mind is blown!

I once said, some time ago:
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
"I'll never fall in love, or let my feelings show"
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Look what you've done to me, you changed my mind
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It had to be someone like you, 'cause you're one of a kind

Yeeeahhh...

Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no

(Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no)
I can't, can't leave you alone
(Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no)
Won't somebody please tell me, what's going on?

(Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no)
I can't, can't leave you alone
(Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no)
Won't somebody please tell me, what's going on?
'Cause, ha...

Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no 
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no 
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no 
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no 
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no 
Can't leave you alone, can't leave you alone, no
