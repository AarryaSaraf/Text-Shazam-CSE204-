When I first looked in your eyes
I found out I was crying for a prize

I never thought I'd fall in love with you, no, not you
I never thought that you would love me too

When I speak of love to you
I know you wonder if it's true

I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I never thought that you would love me too

When I'm making love to you
It seems that's all I live to do

I never thought I'd fall in love with you, no, not you
I never thought that you would love me too

As the hands of time do change
My love for you, girl, will remain

I never thought I'd fall in love with you, no, not you
I never thought that you would love me too

I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I never thought that you would love me too

I never thought I'd fall in love with you, not you
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I, I, I, I, I never thought that you would love me too

I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I never thought that you would love me too
I, I, I, I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I never thought that you would love me too
