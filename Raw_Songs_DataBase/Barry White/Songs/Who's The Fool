People never cease to amaze me with their opinions, heh...
I shared my thoughts about us with a few friends of mine
And it was really amazing
How do people try to tell you, what you can do and what you can't do
I've been called a fool, crazy, simply because I told them that I wanted you

Who's the fool, who's crazy
I can't deny what I feel for you inside
Said the fool to the lady:
"I come alive, the moment I see you"
If wanting you is crazy
Then I'm a fool
Yes, a fool for you baby
And you, maybe you
Might be just a little crazy too

Never before have I known such a lady
And never before has it felt this good to me, my baby
Never before, and I wanna give my love so freely
Never before did I find being with someone so easy

By the way (by the way), ooh, the other day
I saw you, and I swear I knew
That I'd be here, right here, with you
Who's the fool...

Who is a fool?
Baby, you are so refreshing
Different in every sense of the word, you're...
You're someone that I've wanted for such a long, long time
To be here with you like this
To feel what I feel being here with you, like this
And baby, to know what I know is gonna happen
With me touching you like this
All night long like this

Who, who's the fool, who's crazy
Hey girl, tonight we're gonna make it all come true
Said the fool to his lady:
"I'm going to prove my love to you"

Never again will I love such a lady
Never again will it feel this good to me, my baby
Never again will I wanna give my love so freely
Never again will I find being with someone so easy

By the way (by the way), ooh, the other day
I saw you (you), baby I swear I knew
That I'd be here, laying right here, with you

Who's the fool...
I, I, I, I, I...
I like that, yeah yeah (admit it)
Oh, I like that, yeah yeah (I must admit it)

Let me reach inside and touch your spiritual soul
Let me put your body out of control (ah-whoo...!)
