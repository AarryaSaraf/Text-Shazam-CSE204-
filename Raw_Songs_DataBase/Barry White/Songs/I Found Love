Since the beginning of time, men have been finding things
Man has found knowledge and wisdom, and man is still trying to find himself
But among those great findings, baby I want you to know that I found something too
Baby, I found love... when I found you

One is a lonely number
Sometimes it's lonely and blue
One really needs, really needs someone
Girl, I found you
I really do believe I found love
Darling I, I found love

Two is a lucky number
But only when it's me and you
Ain't it wonderful, girl, to know
Dreams really do come true
You better believe that I found love
Ooh, yeah yeah

I... I found love

How lucky can two people really be, I mean...
How much of it is luck, and how much... how much is destiny?
It seems to me, girl, like we found the perfect number to make our life complete
Two - that's me, baby, that's you
Two... two

Three is one too many
There's only room for two
You're the one, you're the one for me girl
And I'm sho-nuff the one for you
You better believe that I found love
I swear to God, love fills my heart

Darling I, I do believe that I found love
Girl I swear, I swear, I swear
I do believe that I found love
I... found love
You better believe that I found love
Found love
I... girl I found love
