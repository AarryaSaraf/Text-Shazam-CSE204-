Baby put me in
Everything you've ever wanted is here
Put me in
I don't care how you mix this
I don't care how you fix it but
Baby, put me in your mix

All you've ever wanted
Or how you wanted or where you want it
Just take my love and put it in your mix

I'm waiting patiently
Hoping that I can be in your mix
It's you that I adore
Just wait, there's so much more in my mix
Sweet as honey it can be
But you're the lock and you're the key
All my love you need is here
So open up and have no fear
Girl to you I'll give my heart
And I'll be there when you call
I know the things that you can do
Just know I'm always there for you

For all you know
I'm the best you'll know
Put me in your mix
I wanna be right there
I know just what you like
Give me a chance tonight
In your mix
I need to be there

Don't you know for all you know
I'm the best you'll know
Put me in your mix
I need to be right there
I can love you right
Can we start tonight
In your mix

There's something you need to know
How much I need you so in my mix
So don't keep love to yourself
You'll find a greater wealth in your mix
Smooth as honey it will be
And I love you with dignity
I wanna be with you so much
I wanna feel the way you touch
All the love you need is here
No more lies and no more tears
Let me come inside your world
I can make your toe nails curl

For all you know
I might be the best you'll know
Put me in you mix
I need to be right there
I can love you right
Can we start tonight
In your mix
I need to be there

For all you know
I'm the best you'll know
Put me in you mix
I know just what you like
Give me a chance tonight
In your mix
I need to be right there

Don't you know for all you know
I'm the best you know
Put me in your mix
I can love you right
Can we start tonight
In your mix

You never know
You just might really like it
So baby please, please
Put me in your mix

Don't you know for all you know
I'm the best you know
Put me in your mix
I know just what you like
In your mix

Don't you know for all you know
I'm the best you know...
