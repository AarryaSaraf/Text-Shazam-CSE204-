My mother has a lot of favorite songs, that I've written
But you wanna know, between you and me? Heh... I think this is her favorite song
I guess it's her favorite song, because it deals with the things, so many things, that happen to you in a day
Remember that old Washington once said, "what a difference a day makes"?
24 little hours...
My mother has asked me many times during the years, "why don't you record that song"?
And... and it's one of my favorites too
Because it's real, it deals with... truth
Many things, that can change overnight
You can wake up in the morning, everything is wrong
By the time you go to sleep, everything is right
You never know, you never ever know
So this is my mother's song, "All In The Run Of A Day"

A new baby cries
Some poor soul dies
(That's the way life goes)
But that's the way life goes
(Everybody knows it's a)
It's a pleasure and pain
(Ooh...)
 broken chains
All in the run of a day
Yea-ey-ey

You can be down and out
And rise again (rise again)
Wage your dreams
Then cash it in (then cash it in)
We do it all...
We do it all!
In a day

It's a give and take (given, taken)
We hope that we will make it (hope we'll, make it)
But never, never let it go
You know love walks out on you (someone's leaving)
Then you found you someone new (stumble your grieving)
(All..) all in the run of a day
Yea-ey-ey

We move through life
At such a fast pace (such a fast pace)
Giving old Father Time
An endless chase (endless chase)
We do it all...
We do it all!
In a day

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh...

(All..) all in the run of a day
Yea-ey-ey

Sometimes just take
A little time out and say (we should say)
"Thank you", for Jesus has given me
Another day (for one more day)
He does it all...
He does it all!
In a day, yeah
In a day, yeah

Be down and out
And rise again (ooh)
Wage your dreams
Then cash it in
We do it all
We do it all
(Ah...)

Oh, yeah yeah
Mhm, mhm
