(Hung up on you, I wanna love you insane
Hung up on you, I don't even know your name)

Our theme is trust
(Hung up on you, I wanna love you insane)
Our theme is truth
Our theme is honor
Our theme is understanding
Our theme is love, believe it

Something inside me says I'm in love with you
Something inside me knows sure
Something inside me says I'm in love with you
Something inside me knows sure

(Hung up on you, I wanna love you insane
Hung up on you, I don't even know your name)
