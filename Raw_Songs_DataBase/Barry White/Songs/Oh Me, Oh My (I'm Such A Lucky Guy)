Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die

I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
When I wake up
Every morning
You're the sunshine in my eyes
With you girl, I'm a winner
You're my previous prize
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
You ask me why do I love you
There's a million reasons why
But it's so hard for me to tell you
Cause each day they multiply
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Until the day I'll die
I'll love you
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Oh me
Oh Me, Oh My
I'm such a lucky guy
Oh me
