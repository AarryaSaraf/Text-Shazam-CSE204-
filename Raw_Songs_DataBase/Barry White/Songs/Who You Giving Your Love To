All is she can tell me is love
This is so important that I need to know
It's now or never
How she stands?
What's going on?
Excuse me, can I have a minute of your time please?
But I need to say this
I've seen you many times before
And each I've seen you
You've been alone
And I was just wondering (I was wondering if I)
If I, if I could share this with you

Somebody wants to get close to you
Oh, I can't take another night or another day
Without asking you face to face

Could you tell me?
Will you tell me

Who, who you giving your love to?
Who, who is spending time with?
I need to know, I really need to know
Who, who you giving your love to?
Tell me baby, I really need to know
(How much you love somebody)
I want it badly (I want so badly)
I need it badly

In solitute as I lay awake in bed
So many fantasies of ectasy, fills my head

Your personality, hmm
Your such a lady, hmm
Oh, this dream I know it sounds insane
I know so insane
But you make me feel just so strange
Every word I said is true
I even shared my feelings to
Be my lady

Would you tell me?
Baby, could you tell me?

Girl who, who you giving your love to?
Tell me
Who, who is spending time with you?
I need to know
Who, who is spending time with you?
I want your time, tell me, who?
Won't you be mine
Who's getting all that
Girl, who's getting all that
