Remember?
September
Remember?
September
Ooh...

September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)
September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)

Oh, what a day it was
Everything so clear
Something about that day
I could feel it in the air
(In the air, everywhere)

Woo, suddenly I knew
Why I felt that way
The moment I laid eyes on you
Girl, I just had to say:

"Please let me be the one
You give your love to"
If we reminisce
Through all of this
Let's vow and make
Everyday anew

September
Remember?
September
Remember?

September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)
September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)

Oh, what a night it was
How I had it planned
Things I would say and do
The way I'd hold your hand

But when you rushed into my arms
There was nothing left to say (nothing left to say)
I'll never forget that night
I'll never forget that day
Woo...!

September (remember?)
(September, remember?)
(September, remember?)
(September, remember?)

September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)
Ooh
September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)
Ooh
September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)
Ooh, ooh

September, remember?...
