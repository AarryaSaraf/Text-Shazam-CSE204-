The moon was full, the night was strange
I had no idea my life would change
And there you were, right before my eyes
Your beauty had me hypnotized

Hung up in your love baby
Under your spell
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
Hung up in your love baby
Under your spell
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell

You're never bitter girl, you're always sweet
An exotic, tasty treat
You're erotic, and yet just so discreet
Girl, you give my body so much heat

You fascinate, stimulate and captivate
You keep me wanting more, more
You invite, you excite and then ignite
I never felt this way before

I'm hung up in your love baby
Under your spell
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
Oh well
Hung up in your love baby
Under your spell, well
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
Oh well

Hung up in your love baby
I'm under your spell
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
Oh well
Hung up in your love baby
Caught in your spell
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
Oh well

I'm hung up in your love baby
Under your spell, girl
Higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
I'm hung up in your love, in your love, baby
Under your spell, girl
