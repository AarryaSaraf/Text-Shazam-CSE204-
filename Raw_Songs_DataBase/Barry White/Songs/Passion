Make us see, make us free...

Moonlight
Shine down on our hearts
Make us free
Tonight
Let our hearts enjoy ecstasy
It feels so good, that I can't take it
Here's my heart, and please don't break it

Darling
There's a shooting star
Make a wish
For us
To go on and on
Just like this
We are free to start the party
Just come close and feel my body

Passion will come and blow our minds
Music will keep our hearts in time
(Passion)
(Music, will keep our hearts in time)

Heaven
That's not far at all
Wait and see
This night
Just belongs to you
And to me
It feels so good, that I can't take it
Take my heart, but please don't break it
We are free to start the party (yeah)
Just come close and feel my body

Passion will come and blow our minds
Music will keep our hearts in time
Oh yeah

(Passion)

Darling
There's a shooting star
Make a wish
For time
To go on and on
Just like this
It feels so good, that I can't take it
It's my heart, but please don't break it

Passion will come and blow our minds (oh yeah)
Music will keep our hearts in time
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...
