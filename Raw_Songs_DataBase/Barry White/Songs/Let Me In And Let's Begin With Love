Let's... yeah, let's... love
Let's... yeah, let's... love

(Let's...) Let me in
(Yeah, let's...) And let's begin
(Love...) With love
Oh my...

He really did not love you
She didn't love me too
For whatever reason
We can't let yesterday
Block our way from
Starting something new

Girl, I sense you're lonely
Well, I'm lonely too
I wanna be with you only

Just let me in and let's begin with love
(We can't lose)
Let me in and let's begin with love
(We know the rules)
Let me in and let's begin with love

Listen, listen...
Love is really magic
What wonders it can do
Girl, we've got the power
Oh yes we can, I know we can
We can make it all come true

Girl I'll make it easy
We won't push and shove
I really want you completely

Ohhh...
Let me in and let's begin with love
(We can't lose)
Let me in and let's begin with love
(We know the rules)
My, my...
Let me in and let's begin with love

Girl, I can sense you're willing
Just for one more try
Follow your heart and feelings, ohhh

Let me in and let's begin with love
(Di di di di di...)
Let me in (baby, let's begin)
Girl, let's begin with love
Let me in
Baby, let's begin
With love...
(Help me, please...)
Let's... yeah, let's... love
Yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah...

Just let me in and let's begin with love
(Ahhh, ahhh)
Let's... yeah, let's... love
(Do, do doo....)
Let's... yeah, let's... love
Let me in, let's begin with love
(Take my hand and understand, ohh...)
Let's begin with love, yeah...
Let's... yeah, let's... love
My...
Let's... I mean, let's... let's make love
