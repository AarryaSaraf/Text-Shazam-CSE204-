Freedom makes live worth living
And freedom makes live worth giving
To be free, free, to be me

(Free, free, free, free...)
Every living thing, that God made, is free

I'm free
And no matter
That's what it's gonna be
Free
I'm free
And no matter
God made this life for me

Everybody's got the right
To live the way they want to, the way they like
I don't intend to bother you
So don't concern yourself 'bout what I do

Telling you I'm free
(Free, free, free, free...)
I'm free
And no matter
God gave this life to me
I'm free
To win a loot 
And no matter
I've got that ride to truth
Yes I do

I'm not always right, sometimes I'm wrong
I know that I'm weak, and I know I'm strong
But God is the power that I've got (oh yeah!)
I don't pretend that I'm something, I know I'm not

That's why I'm telling you I'm free
(Free, free, free, free...)
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free

(Free, free, free...)
I'm free...

I'm free
And no matter
That's what it's gonna be
You're free
To live your life your way
And no matter
What I do, what I think, or say

Free
I'm free
That's what it's gonna be
Ha ha ha, ha!
