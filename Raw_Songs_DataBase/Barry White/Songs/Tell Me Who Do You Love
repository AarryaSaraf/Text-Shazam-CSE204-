Can I ask you something?
If I didn't mean as much as it means to me
And if I didn't feel what I feel inside, baby I..
I really wouldn't ask you this
But it's something that I want to know so bad
Tell me... who do you love?

Who do you love?
Tell me
Tell me, tell me
Tell me, who do you love?
Who do you love?
Tell me, tell me

Who do you love?
Tell me, tell me
Who do you love?
Tell me, tell me
Who do you love?
Tell me, tell me
Who do you love?
Tell me, tell me
Who do you love?
Tell me, tell me
Who do you love?
Tell me, tell me
