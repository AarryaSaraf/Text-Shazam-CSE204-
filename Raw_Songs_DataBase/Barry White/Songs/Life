This song is... dedicated to my seven children
And all the other children of the world
To every little boy, and every little girl

Life has always been a trip
Watch your step - you might slip
Be careful

Life has always been a game
No one knows, what tomorrow will bring
Trust me

Distractions, the world is full of distractions

You want money? Then earn it
You want knowledge? Then learn it

There's nothing and no one
Greater than the God, that is within you
You have the power
Every minute, and every hour
The power... every day of your life

Young man, young woman
God is in your soul
You're the captain of your ship
So be the master of your goal

Life will always be a test
You wanna win? Then give it your best
Yeah... give it all you got

Life will always be unkind
To those, who just keep wasting time...
