Kind of upset
But I shouldn't be
When things go smoothly invent problems
In my stupid head
What's wrong with getting by on what gets you by I know it's no big deal
But why do I feel stupid when head my is happy
What happened to
My imagination
How can things be so un-intense?
Can I arrange to be deranged
Can I arrange to have a change
Thought I might be there
Forgot the shortcut there
I know I won't be there
Forgot the shortcut there
Thought I might be there
Thought I was already there but
Forgot the shortcut there
I know I won't be there
I know I've never been there
Forgot the shortcut there
