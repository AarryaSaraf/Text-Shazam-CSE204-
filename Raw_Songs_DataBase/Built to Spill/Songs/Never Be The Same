Go everywhere you wanna go
See everything you wanna see
And everyone you wanna know

If that's what you want
You got it, you got it
If that's what you want

We would never be the same
We would never be the same

You've seen it all, you've seen it all
Seen it all, there's nothing else
You know it all, you know it all
Except to keep it to yourself

If that's what you think
You thought it, you thought it
If that's what you think

We would never be the same
We would never be the same

I know you got something
Everybody wants to know
I know you know something
Everybody's gotta know
I know you want something
Everybody's gotta go
I know you need something

And that's the way it's gonna be
Cause that's the way it's always been
And in another century
It's gonna be this way again

We would never be the same
We would never be the same
We would never be the same
We would never be the same
