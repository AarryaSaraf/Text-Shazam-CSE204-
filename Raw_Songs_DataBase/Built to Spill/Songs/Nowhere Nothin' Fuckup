say a word for Jimmy Brown
been nowhere he's done nothing
probably not even a shirt on his back
ain't got nothing at all
say a word for Ginger Brown
walks around with his head down
they took the shoes from his feet
threw the poor boy out in the street nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin'
nowhere nothin' now say a word for Karen Brown
she can't tell the night from the day
they threw her out in the street
just like a cat she landed on her feet
say a word for Charlie Brown
ain't got nothin' at all
everyday she falls in love and every night she falls
and when she does it's with a nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' nowhere nothin' now nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' nowhere nothin' now
