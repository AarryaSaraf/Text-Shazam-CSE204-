How can I hear, how can I see
When no one really knows how it's gonna be?
You read it in a book, you hope it isn't true
And the next thing you know, it's happening to you

It's been a long time since we took a trip
To the bottom of a canyon in a rocket ship
Nothing's resonating in my mind
So I'm doing my best to be unrefined

You can always choose, but you don't
And you could be amused, but you won't
There's no way to figure it out
Life's just understood

But really I don't know
But really I don't know
Really I don't know

The deaf hear, the blind see
Just different things than you and me
The deaf can hear, the blind can see
That's what I've been told and that's what I believe

But really I don't know
But really I don't know
Really I don't know

You can always choose, but you don't
And you could be amused, but you won't
There's no way to figure it out
Life's just understood

It's been a long way, since the start of it
And part of the problem is... you're such a part of it
Seems like whatever we do is null
Why can't we ever just be left alone?

The blind see, the deaf hear
Exactly what is not clear
The blind can see, the deaf can hear
Finding out what is my greatest fear

You wanna move around, you wanna stay still
You wanna have a life, but not too real
Don't know what it means, but I know what it's like
To be floating down the canyon in a rocket bike

But really I don't know
But really I don't know
Really I don't know
