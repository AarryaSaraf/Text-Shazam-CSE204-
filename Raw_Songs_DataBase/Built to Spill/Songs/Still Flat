And you tell me this and you tell me that
No matter how the thing grows it's still flat
And you showed me this
And you showed me that
Because of where you came from
You know where its at
Another Marxist celebration
This time with pipes instead of guns
With very little dedication
To anything that isn't fun
It's gonna take some dedication
It's gonna take some dedica...

And you showed me this and you showed me that
Because of where I came from
You know where I'm at
And you tell me this and you tell me that
No matter how round it feels its still flat
Its still flat
Another cosmic demonstration
With stars colliding into suns
It doesn't take imagination
Its just the way this stuff is done
Better than your imagination
