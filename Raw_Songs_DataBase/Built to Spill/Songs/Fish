Try aching every care in the world
She's only the most beautiful girl
The more I think it, the badder it gets
I was swimming along when I was caught in her net

She's got me singing with a broken heart
I keep on messing with my mind torn apart
She's only forgotten we've been left in the dust
I guess my art didn't help very much

Then the superlove got me again
Got me dreaming I could almost win
I stopped to take a look around with a grin
So much turmoil in this crazy town

She's got me bloodied from hitting the bricks
Is this the way the girlies get their kicks?
And now I see as if it makes a difference
Everyone in love, hating and hurting each other

Always thinking it's near the end
And I was hoping she'd be my friend
Lost forever, only wishing again
Oh, to be alive and free from sin

Psycho love in The Twilight Zone
Drippy soap opera on the telephone
I get so close, but I don't belong
Straining to identify with the radio song

Then I see her as if in a dream
It's so real, I could almost scream
She's doing her ritual, the same for any man
Like a movie, it's so deadpan

I'm looking for love in the darkness
I haven't a chance at false romance
Maybe next time I'll whisper something new
I'm so ashamed, so unglued

I've had enough and she'll never know
I feel like staying, but my subconscious says, "Go"
Shed a tear like blood on the floor
It's only love and nothing more

She's got me singing with a broken heart
I keep on messing with my mind torn apart
She's only forgotten we've been left in the dust
I guess my art didn't help very much
