Sitting at the railway station
Reading books about intimidation
Waiting for my girl to come
And if she does will she be dumb
Or really smart
Will she break my heart
And wad it up and throw it in my face
I knew I'd find a nice girl someday
Find a nice girl
Settle down

Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone who'll give me time and give me space
And take it all away

Sitting at the bus station
Reading books about legislation
Suddenly my girl comes
And she's not even dumb
In fact she's kind of smart
Will she break my heart
And wad it up and throw it in my face
I knew I'd find a nice girl someday
Send a nice girl
Settle down

Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone who'll give me time and give me space and take it all away

Actually I've never even been to a railroad station even though I used to live near one
And still I'm waiting for my girl to come
And if she does will she be dumb
Or really smart
Will she break my heart
And wad it up and throw it in my face
Wad it up and throw it in my face
I knew I'd find a nice girl someday
Find a nice girl
Settle down

Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone I can talk to
