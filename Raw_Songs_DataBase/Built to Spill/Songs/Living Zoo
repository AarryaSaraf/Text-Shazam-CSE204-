We know where we wanna go
But we can't tell
On our own how to navigate
Our way through hell

Sometimes when you wake up
(Sometimes wake up lonely)
You feel alone
Somehow we get over it
(Somehow keep it going)
And you go on

Ahhh
That's alright
Ahhh
We're doing fine

They say there's a part of us
We can't explain
Please say you'll do anything
To make me stay

Being a human
Being an animal too
Being in a cage and
Being a living zoo

Being a person
Being an animal too
Being all alone and
Being all me and you

Cause we're lions in our cages
And tigers in tiny spaces
