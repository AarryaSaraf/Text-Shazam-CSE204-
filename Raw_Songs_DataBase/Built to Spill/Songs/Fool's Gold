I'm gonna keep trying
Keep trying
I'm gonna keep trying

Well now it's been an hour since I woke up
With this song running through my head
And the feeling that it gave me has started to slip away
It was only a dream but it still felt good
To spend a little time thinking something mattered
And I want to tell you something I got nothing to say

I'm gonna keep trying
Keep trying
I got a chance
I'm gonna keep trying

Just a dream
Just 'cause I'm asleep
Just a dream no one else can see
Just a dream
Just a dream

I'm gonna keep trying
If I don't keep trying, I'm never gonna make it
I'm gonna keep trying

Fools gold made me rich for a little while
Rich for a little while, rich for a little while
Fools gold made me rich for a little while

Just a dream
Just a dream

Fools gold made me rich for a little while
Rich for a little while, rich for a little while
Fools gold made me rich for a little while

It don't matter what they say
I'm gonna break my heart someday
Don't matter what they say
I'm gonna break my heart someday
Don't matter
(White noise let me sleep for a little while)
Don't matter
(White noise let me sleep for a little while)
Don't matter
(White noise let me sleep for a little while)
