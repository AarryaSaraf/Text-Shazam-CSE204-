I like waking up Saturday
'Cause I'm all forgetting all my troubles behind
And I don't wanna see no other way
I don't wanna have to mess with making up my mind
Geology genealogy
Arbitrarily eventually came up with me
Sometimes we're high, sometimes we're low
High low, high low, I guess that's just the way we go

I don't wanna be constantly taking these
Long hard looks at myself
This psychology's been inside of me
I don't know how to be anybody else
Nobody else save me
Nobody else save us all

And now my heart don't have time for that
It's too busy pumping blood
My heart don't have time for that
It's too busy pumping blood

I don't see how anyone does anything
How they even make it through their days
And god don't ever help anyone
He's too busy working in mysterious ways
Geometry trigonometry
I don't know what they mean...

I know none of that's
Gonna help with all this pain
