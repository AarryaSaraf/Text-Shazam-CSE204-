You'll never know, dear, the tears that I cry
I don't wanna wait, girl, till the day that I die
Tell me now, oh-oh, do you really love me?
I don't understand the things that you do
You promised to make me the king of the zoo
Tell me now, oh-oh, do you really love me?

In this world
It's hard to find
A friend who cares
But if this really is love
Then lets get it on, on, on

I wanna know, dear, the way that you feel
I'm on a roll, girl, my heart's like a wheel
Tell me now, oh-oh, do you really love me?
If I could trust the look in your eye
What if your kiss could be a lie?
Tell me now, oh-oh, do you really love me?

In this world
It's hard to find
A friend who cares
But if this really is love
Then lets get it on, on, on

Tell me now, oh-oh, do you really love me?
Oh-oh, do you really love me?
Do you really love me?
