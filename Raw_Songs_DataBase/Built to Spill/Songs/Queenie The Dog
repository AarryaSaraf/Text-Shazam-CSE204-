Queenie the doggie was a friend of mine
If only the money could save her now
Queenie the dog

Queenie the doggie, the special one
She always had the most fun most all of the time
Queenie the dog

She was all the laughing heard that sailed the ocean sea
She would talk the birds that walked, that cursed reality
Queenie the dog

Queenie was funny, she'd laugh at every joke
But we sure were surprised when she finally did spoke
Queenie the dog

Queenie the doggie sent down from heaven above
An angel in disguise filled with such love
Queenie the dog

Now and then I find myself listening to Queenie bark
At the twilight of the night as if I was a werewolf in the dark
Queenie the dog

She was the funny, the dog with only kind mind
The peace and the quiet I hope she will find
Queenie the dog

Queenie the doggie howling at the sun
Queenie the doggie, just to watch her puppies run
Queenie the dog

Somewhere I know she's laughing in the clouds
Just to see what it's all about
Queenie the dog

Queenie the doggie, there's only you and me
Queenie the doggie will live eternity
Queenie the dog

Love is an illusion, it plays with your brain
It's plain and it's simple, it's hard to explain
Queenie the dog
Queenie the dog

Queenie the doggie was a friend of mine
If only the money could save her now
Queenie the dog
Queenie the dog
If only the money could save her now
Okay
