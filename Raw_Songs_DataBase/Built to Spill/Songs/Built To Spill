built to spill
you are pleased precariously
temporarily filled
you will
spill until lower expectations
momentarily chilled
you will
built to spill
because at the time it seemed
like an acceptable deal
you feel
you feel
you feel like you are on the verge of something real
on a role and built to spill
this is how you'll always feel it's no big deal I'm ashamed of you my friend
would you please
would you please I'm to blame for this my friend
would you please
would you please built to spill
carry out your function then occasionally filled
you will
you will
you will come alive to something real then realize you're built to spill
this is how you'll always feel it's no big deal
