you can't tell me that you don't know who you are
it's there from the start
it comes with the package
any attempt that you make to escape this
useless and unnecessary make up your mind
make it up as you go
make it the truth
make it what you already know she said that's not what she said
unthink the things in your head
it's justa white that you red
Chris went right over their heads you can't be anything
you can't be nothing
you can't be anything
you can't be nothing
you can't be anything
you can't be nothing
you can't be anything
you can't be nothing
you can't be anything
you can't be nothing
you can't be anything if you can't be nothing
