I'm killing time
Want it all the time
Want it to go away

I'm stealin' time
Want time all the time
Or want it to go away

Revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution

How come people don't fuck it up?
It's like turning on the heat

I'm just in time
Time to see it all
Make it go away

I change my mind
Change it all the time
Want it to go away

Revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution

How come people don't fuck it up?
It's like turning on the heat
