hazy
just because sometimes you make me crazy
just because sometimes you let me know
I don't
maybe
today will show me the something that will phase me
something that will move me besides dreams
it seems
seems like
lately
everything I see and hear makes me angry
even what I say and do myself
what else can I say I'm still waiting for this moment to be gone
million mile second
a million thoughts in one
high and wondering why so loud and bright
I ain't got no idea what the hell is going on
