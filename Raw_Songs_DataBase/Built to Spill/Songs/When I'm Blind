When will I realize when I'm blind
When will I realize when I'm blind

Stars fall down
Burn the ground
No one makes a sound

Waters rise
Drown the skies
No one seems surprised

I got lost
I got lost
I got lost

I got lost
I got lost
I got lost

When will I realize when I'm blind

When I'm blind I'll see
What is wrong with me

When will I realize when I'm blind

When I'm blind I'll see
What is wrong with me
