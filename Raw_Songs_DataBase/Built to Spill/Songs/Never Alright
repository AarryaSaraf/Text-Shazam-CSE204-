It's never how you remember
It's never quite the truth
It's never enough to get there
It's never enough for you

It's never been what they said there
It's never been what they do
It's never enough to get there
It's never enough for you

It's never alright
It's never alright

Breaking your heart must break their hearts
Breaking their hearts must break your heart

I can never see
I can never see beyond this
Beyond this, I can never see
I could never see beyond this, beyond this

Where they are
They could never be honest
Where they are
They could never be honest

No one can ever help no one
Not get their heart broken
All of this longing makes all of these days seem so long

And every day, everyone tells you
Everything you oughta be
I know that you don't believe 'em
But you take 'em so seriously

It's never alright
It's never alright
