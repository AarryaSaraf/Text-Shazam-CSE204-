Your lie last night
You make time alright
Well, I might look twice
But don't try their kind

No, don't try their kind
They might seem fine
You're like sunshine
Inside, all mine

And everyone goes on and on
And everyone goes on and on
Everyone goes on and on

Everyone goes on and on
Everyone goes on and on
Everyone goes on and on
Everyone goes on and on

Your lie last night
You make time alright
I might look twice
But don't try their kind
