Started out right in the night
Had a few fights with my mind
I saw the future and I saw a ghost
I saw a creature you know, you know
Someone's gonna mess up your mind
That isn't hard to find
How you gonna take it in your soul
No one may ever know

Who's gonna waste all your time

I've had these feelings for a long time
Ever since I was a kid
I thought they go away by now
But now I see they never did
I learned a lot about the way things are
And what we're supposed to do
And why you're me and why I'm you

Who's gonna waste all your time

And if you wanna know a secret
You better want to take it to your grave
I know you'll wanna talk about it
But talking doesn't make it go away
It's a sticky situation
And that's why everyone gets stuck
Now you know and now you know it's gone
Now you feel it now you're feeling wrong
Maybe we'll get it maybe we'll get along
Now you know and now you know it's gone

And we'll be alright in this spiderweb of love
And we'll be alright in this spiderweb of love
