Your picture
Is still
On my wall
On my wall
The colors
Are bright
Bright
As ever
The red is strong
The blue is true
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time your picture
Is still
On my wall
On my wall
I think
About you
Often
Often
I can't forget all the things we did
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time it's funny

But it's true
And it's true
But it's not funny
Time comes and goes
All the while
I still think of you
Some things last a long time
Your picture
Is still
On my wall
On my wall
The colors
Are bright
Bright
As ever
Times that we shared
All that we forget
Some things last a life time
Some things last a life time
