Now it seems so terrible, at the time it didn't seem like much
All the months and miles in between us
And it's terrible

Save some place in your mind
I'm getting good at time
Save some space in your mind
I'm getting out of time

Once in awhile there's this girl I don't know in my dreams
She reminds me of a lot of people
But she's someone that I've never seen
And she's perfect

Save a place in your mind
I'm getting good at time
Save some space in your mind
I'm getting out of time
