Haven't had a half a hand
It's half of what I am
Haven't heard of half the things
That happened in the past

Haven't given half the time to half the people
Half the things I've planned
You don't have to be so cruel
'Cause all I do is a little less than what I can

Happiness will only
Happen when it can
Happiness will only
Happen when it can

Haven't had the half of mind to stay
And start to take a stand
Haven't held on half as long as I had hoped
As I had hoped to plan

Happiness, half the shit they said I had
In half didn't have a chance
You don't have to be so cruel
'Cause all I do is a little less than what I can

Happiness will only
Happen when it can
Happiness will only
Happen when it can

Happiness will only
Happen when it can
Happiness will only
Happen when it can
