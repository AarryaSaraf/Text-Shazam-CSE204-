You hurt me so bad
You were the best friend I ever had
Now I'm crawling in my shoes
Trying to get back to you

Impossible love
I just can't get to you
Impossible love
I'm tangled up in you

You left me so long
I can remember the times
How we really cared
All the dreams that we shared

Impossible love
I just can't get to you
Impossible love
I'm tangled up in you

My life just goes on
And what have I become?
You were the only one
You were my shining sun

Impossible love
I just can't get to you
Impossible love
I'm tangled up in you

I just can't believe that it's all over
I just want a chance to see you again

You were my one true love
With the light from above
And I'm hurting because
I want more of your love

But it's impossible love
I just can't get to you
Impossible love
I'm tangled up in you
