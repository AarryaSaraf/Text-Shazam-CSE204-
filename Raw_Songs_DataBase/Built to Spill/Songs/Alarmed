In the hurry of the past
I forgot to make it last
Simple choices made too fast
By a dye I didn't cast

I'm alarmed and I can't help from
Crashing onto this island we've become
Words for fighting, words for fun
They've all melted into one

On the tip of every tongue
Like the new name for the sun
I'm alarmed and I can't recover from
Crashing onto this island we've become

Alright now, don't decide about that now
Oh, how can you blame the only one?
Ever stay, ever stay, ever stayed around, and you would
Never say, never say all the harm's been done

And you were all so gone, oh so long, so long
Did you make it all wrong, so wrong?
Did you wait oh, so long, so long?
Did you take it all wrong, so wrong?
