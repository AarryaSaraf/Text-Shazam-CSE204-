You're a fool for everything
I'm a fool for not thinking that things would turn out this way
Like to think that you're immune
To the stuff, it's closer to the truth to say you're full of shit
You're gonna have to face it

So and so, he has a job
Gets up at a certain time, goes to a certain place
Takes a lot of pride in his work
But it's not what he would choose to do
He just does it for the money
And the opportunity

So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever

More or less a waste of flesh
You're so insecure, you probably think this song's about you
Don't be so hard on yourself
There's plenty of flesh to go around
Besides it's not like you are not using it
And who is who to say what flesh should do
And who should have it for that use

So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever

Wherever, wherever, wherever, wherever
Wherever, wherever, wherever, wherever
Wherever, wherever, wherever, wherever
Wherever, wherever, wherever, wherever
