I thought I
Had it so bad
I didn't realize how much
I relied on you
More than just a memory
More like a feelin'
I'd remember every time
Anytime I needed it

Oh, and I needed it more
Than I could have imagined
'Cause this feelin' it ran deep
In my mind, my heart, and my soul

But late one night
I stumbled by the home
Cursing awful things
Hope she didn't hear me

Oh, but I think she did
As I hug my newfound sorrow
Oddly, it gives me strength
In my mind, my heart, and my soul

My heart sank
With the moon
On that horrible walk all alone
By the drive-in

Oh, and the night stood still
While lovers entwined on the screen on the hill
I knew somethin' had happened
In my mind, my heart, and my soul

That little grin
It meant so much
So sad, it's so sad
If it don't grin for me no more

Oh, but I hope you know better
I didn't mean what I was saying
But it's a fool that says I was only joking
In my mind, my heart, and my soul

Don't you mind me
If switch from first to the second person
I'm mixed up, I don't know
Who I'm talking to

Oh, but somethin's missin'
I hope I can bring it back
It's somethin' that I lack
In my mind, my heart, and my soul

Sorry
I'm sorry
