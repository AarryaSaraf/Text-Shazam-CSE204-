// The First Song //

My thoughts are commodities
My lies are me
My price is a compromise
My pay is peace

And words just make it worse
They're misunderstood, see just like there
If you can't spell it out, if it's just understood
Then you think it isn't there

I make my mind up
Convince my brain
I lie on accident
Trying to explain

But all the things that I was told
All the people that told me
How can I not believe in things that
Everyone else sees?

// Three Years Ago Today //

The other night I dreamt about a sudden realization
That everything bad that can happen to me would
Woke up screaming, God I hope I'm not bleeding
Out my eyes or mouth when I die

I have seen a sheepish wonder
I see me three years ago today
No one's gonna push my buttons
No one's gonna have their say

A little while later I was trying to remember
But then it didn't seem quite as awful as it seemed
Can't believe I won't admit that

I have seen a sheepish wonder
I see me three years ago today
No one's gonna push my buttons
No one's gonna have their way

Feel about the same but I'm 10 years older
Watched my cat die for a month now
I have seen a sheepish wonder
I saw you earlier today

// Revolution //

I'm killing time
Want it all the time
Want it to go away

I'm stealin' time
Want time all the time
Or want it to go away

Revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution

How come people don't fuck it up?
It's like turning on the heat

I'm just in time
Time to see it all
Make it go away

I change my mind
Change it all the time
Want it to go away

Revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution

How come people don't fuck it up?
It's like turning on the heat

// Shameful Dread //

Before I get myself unwound
Come around
Docility is tempting bait
Clearcut faith

You settle with a different god
Tiny thoughts
No other way to come to terms
No need to learn

I'm hoping for a change of heart
Hundredth start
A president to call my own
Barely shown

I'll never let you in my head
Shameful dread
I'm hoping for a change of hope

Until I spent some time with you
Thought that everything I do has no weight
Doesn't float, has no weight
Doesn't float, has no weight

Doesn't float

Gonna see this through
Lucky you

// Nowhere Nothin' Fuckup //

say a word for Jimmy Brown
been nowhere he's done nothing
probably not even a shirt on his back
ain't got nothing at all
say a word for Ginger Brown
walks around with his head down
they took the shoes from his feet
threw the poor boy out in the street nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin'
nowhere nothin' now say a word for Karen Brown
she can't tell the night from the day
they threw her out in the street
just like a cat she landed on her feet
say a word for Charlie Brown
ain't got nothin' at all
everyday she falls in love and every night she falls
and when she does it's with a nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' nowhere nothin' now nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' fuckup
nowhere nothin' nowhere nothin' now
in America
every puddle
gasoline rainbow
in America
every puddle
gasoline rainbow
in America
every puddle
gasoline rainbow

// Get A Life //

you can't tell me that you don't know who you are
it's there from the start
it comes with the package
any attempt that you make to escape this
useless and unnecessary make up your mind
make it up as you go
make it the truth
make it what you already know she said that's not what she said
unthink the things in your head
it's justa white that you red
Chris went right over their heads you can't be anything
you can't be nothing
you can't be anything
you can't be nothing
you can't be anything
you can't be nothing
you can't be anything
you can't be nothing
you can't be anything
you can't be nothing
you can't be anything if you can't be nothing

// Built To Spill //

built to spill
you are pleased precariously
temporarily filled
you will
spill until lower expectations
momentarily chilled
you will
built to spill
because at the time it seemed
like an acceptable deal
you feel
you feel
you feel like you are on the verge of something real
on a role and built to spill
this is how you'll always feel it's no big deal I'm ashamed of you my friend
would you please
would you please I'm to blame for this my friend
would you please
would you please built to spill
carry out your function then occasionally filled
you will
you will
you will come alive to something real then realize you're built to spill
this is how you'll always feel it's no big deal

// Lie For A Lie //

I can see a storm awaiting
Quietly anticipating
Don't deny, it no debating

A lie for a lie
A truth for a truth

Cruel, but everybody does it
I thought by now I'd rise above it
You complain but don't discuss it

A lie for a lie
A truth for a truth

I know the thoughts are on your brain
And even if they're not the same
Close enough so don't explain

A lie for a lie
A truth for a truth

Once in a while there's this girl I don't know in my dreams
She reminds me of alot of people
She's someone that I've never seen
And she's perfect

'Kay begin...
...some inaudible screaming

// Hazy //

hazy
just because sometimes you make me crazy
just because sometimes you let me know
I don't
maybe
today will show me the something that will phase me
something that will move me besides dreams
it seems
seems like
lately
everything I see and hear makes me angry
even what I say and do myself
what else can I say I'm still waiting for this moment to be gone
million mile second
a million thoughts in one
high and wondering why so loud and bright
I ain't got no idea what the hell is going on
