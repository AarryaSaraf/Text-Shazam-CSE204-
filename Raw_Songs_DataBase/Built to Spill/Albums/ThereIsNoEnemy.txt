Album: ThereIsNoEnemy

// Aisle 13 //

Know what good you've done
Seem like on just a whim
No one can be on
All sides at once

Every day something strange
I can't explain happens to me
Often I am called by name
To clean up aisle 13

No one knows 'cause no one wants to
Know what they might find
No one sees 'cause no one wants to
See what's in their mind

Don't be all so afraid
Everyone has weird dreams
One day I'll come home to find you
Covered with ants 'cause you're so sweet

No one knows 'cause no one wants to
Know what they might find
No one sees 'cause no one wants to
See what's in their mind

// Hindsight //

Hindsight's giving me
Too much memory
There's too much never seen
But it's always there 'cause it's everywhere

Taking my own advice
Worked out for me nice
But now I come to find
The tricks we play with human brains

They don't want to think about the other side
Is that grass just greener 'cause it's fake?
'Cause that's all that we've been told since we were five years old
Is that all we'll ever know?

Hindsight brings me down
It keeps me on the ground
And though I'm never proud
I wouldn't dare if you weren't there

The thing with getting up
Feelings like giving up
Feels like not enough
You eat a crumb and waste a loaf

They don't want to talk about the other side
Where the grass was greener than they said
'Cause this doesn't bring to mind what I'd expect to find
They must be colorblind

What about Canada?
What about Canada?
This paradise
Of pines and ice

Morning comes in freight ships while you're sleeping
Bad into ideas was no surprise
We'll wait 'till the wild has rights, then never lock doors at night
And kiss all those wars goodbye

// Nowhere Lullaby //

Well, the stakes of the game seemed fine
'Till you lost after this time
Has to make you cry
But you don't and you don't know why

Trying not to solve this
Doesn't mean it's not that bad

And everyone gets through the night
And everyone wakes up alright
And the fear you feel will pass
Then a calmness that will last

We will learn to drift off fast

Another nowhere lullaby
You can rest or you can try
And this waste, it shines in every way
Yeah, this waste, it shines in every way

You make me laugh every single day
And you hardly make me cry
Made fifteen years fly by
Still here and I don't know why

Has it been that long?
Where's the time and the table gone?

Hope it's longer than that now
Don't forget we don't know how
And everyone gets feeling down
Everybody understands

We're all doing what we can

Another nowhere lullaby
You can rest or you can try
And this waste, it shines in every way
Yeah, this waste, it shines in every way

// Good Ol' Boredom //

Break out the water
Kinda celebrate
Welcome back good old boredom
Not so bad seems great

It's nice that it's not that exciting
After all we've been through
When nothing hurts and no one's dying
Most my dreams have come true

And all we see are wrongs to right
They're everywhere, everywhere
The truth is rolling out of sight
And out of mind, out of mind

And all we want is anything
That'll take our minds
Off this nonstop anxiety
For a time

Inside my mind incessant chatter
When will these brain cells cut me some slack?
Maybe I'm not smart enough to think of things to think about that matter
Or afraid that once you think some things, there's no going back

// Life's A Dream //

Miles 'till dawn
But it feels so dark 'till then
Drowns you out
But you can't be too certain

Common wants
Only fill me up with need
Everybody
In this world is just like me

So I row on

Sounds like fear
Thinking there might be a cure
Waste your life
But you don't know what it's worth

Comb your mind
For all the treasures of this earth
Too close to find
Anything outside yourself

So I row on

Life ain't nothing
But a dream
Realistic
As it seems

Destiny's vulgar
So I might as well resist
Out of the darkness
And all the secrets still exist

Finally decided
And by decide, I mean accept
I don't need all those
Other chances I won't get

So I row on

Life ain't nothing
But a dream
Realistic
As it seems

// Oh Yeah //

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah

And if god does exist
I am sure he will forgive
Me for doubting for he'd see
How unlikely he himself seems

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah

// Pat //

Pat, we need your brains back
Pat, we need your fire and your imagination
Pat, we know you fucked up
But we don't care you fucked up, everybody's fucked up

Thought I heard your voice the other night
And sure enough, it came from you
Thought I'd be surprised that you weren't dead
But all I was was glad

Just sitting by your bed
And talking to your head
And hearing what you said
As if you'd never left

Can't you see yourself yet, can't you see through our eyes?
Can't you see the truth?
Nothing's worse than ever, falling in a dream's where
We can see each other

Saw you the other night
Have to say something wasn't right
Of course, but I didn't mind
'Cause seeing you being all alive

Just walking in the room made me so relieved
Like everything was fine and you had never died
Or second-guessed your mind or gave up on our trust
Thought you'd gone too far for us to take you back
But distances like that, Pat, don't exist in fact

// Done //

Loneliness is getting hard to perceive
Seems it never comes or it never leaves
Every day we step into some deceit
This should bring the ill-defined to their feet

It's forgiven, it's all for you
All your problems will come true
Said it once, I'll say it once again
This won't make you happy

All I want is you to make up your mind
To come on down and linger here for a while
All I know is what I wanted to say
Disappeared and has yet to be replaced

It's forgiven, it's for you
All your problems will come true
It's already done, it's already done
It's already done

// Planting Seeds //

I'd hand it to time
If I knew where the time had gone
The connoisseurs were wrong
And so was everyone else

I know what they're saying
'Cause that's all they talk about
Just need to figure out
Some shit for myself

And just because it's obvious
Doesn't mean it's even true
Heard it all and I believe that we deserve another
Point of view

We can make it if we try
And if we don't, it's gonna still be alright
'Cause our minds are still alive
And we can decide what's right

Make up your mind
Make up your own mythology
Afraid of finding me
And of defining you

Take what you want
But you won't want it where you're at
I know this for a fact
Just because it's so true

The first place my mind goes
Is where I never want it to
Like where it hurts the most of all
The stupid shit I say and do

We can make it if we try
And if we don't, it's gonna still be alright
'Cause our minds are still alive
And we can decide what's right

Telling me thousands of times what's next to want
Just doing their job but you know that's a dirty job
Can't stand this game, still we're bullied to play along
When bullies grow up, they get meaner, yeah, they really get it down

They think that they get it
But they always get it wrong
They'll play your favorite song
Just to sell shit to you

I've heard that they'll sell anything
And I think they might
I think Bill Hicks was right
About what they should do

And just because you love something doesn't mean it's yours to buy
Been selling it so long that no one even knows the reason why
You've been messing with our minds
Getting rich wasting our time

// Things Fall Apart //

Came into the darkness from out of the blue
I don't know much but I know what to do
Froze in my mind, I believed it so long
Alright, I'll admit I was wrong

Stay out of my nightmares, stay out of my dreams
You're not even welcome in my memories
When things are alright and I want what I've got
It's only momentarily thought

Fade out, fade out
Fade out, fade out
Fade out, fade out
Fade out, fade out

If no one thinks of no one
Then no one believes in no one
And no one fucks with no one
When no one's afraid of no one

We've all seen enough, now it's time to decide
The meekness of love or the power of pride
It doesn't matter if you're good or smart
Goddamn it, things fall apart

Let's go for a walk, yeah, let's go for a drive
Don't know how to say thanks for being alive
Let's go for a lifetime, let's go for a fling
Don't know how to say anything

// Tomorrow //

Waiting for our answers
This cancer's common as sand
What happens here stays here
'Cause no one anywhere else gives a damn

All said and done, who's gonna bother remembering?
All dead and gone

Like anyone assuming
They know what makes us tick
I was just as wrong as I could be
Only knowing that explained a lot

The more you have to live for
The more you love your life
The harder it will be for you to die
And we all want living and dying easy

Feels like eternity but it's just one lifetime
How can a love that unforbidden be so strong?
There's something wrong with me
I try to forget

I try to forget
But my memory won't fail me now

It's wonderful and scary
Knowing what's alive
A tree, a rock, a turtle or a thought
That's what makes me want to never die

At least we have tomorrow
If we have tomorrow
Tomorrow's just a day beyond today
If tomorrow comes tomorrow

Feels like eternity but it's just one lifetime
How can a love that unforbidden be so strong?
There's something wrong with me
I try to forget

I try to forget
