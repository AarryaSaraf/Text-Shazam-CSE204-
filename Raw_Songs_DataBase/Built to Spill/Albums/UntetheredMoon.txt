Album: UntetheredMoon

// All Our Songs //

You can see right into my mind,
If I can keep it together
Someone's gotta look for you to find,
It's all out there somewhere
And all our songs,
Back before I even remember
I like all those old songs
Sound like the've been here forever

Ah, when it's over, then it's over 
Or so they say we've been over this and we know that there's no other way
And it's so hard to tell the face that never rang a bell
It's like a light bulb went out in my head
And now we settle for this complicated metaphor
And leave the simple truth unsaid

ll night we listened to their second record
It had all these songs
Sounded like we're in this together
And I found a place
Where I know I'll always be tethered
And I knew when I woke up
Rock and roll will be here forever

Form a cloud,
make all of your particles seperate and get together
Rain on down,
show everybody what it means to get wet      
Let's take down all the umbrellas
of all of our enemies
I'll be fine,
in Idaho, America in the 21st century

Oh yeah, that's right, I'm sure I'll be alright
I'm sure I'll be alright
I'm sure that I'll be alright
but I don't know
I don't know

Oh, I'm sure, that I'll be alright,
but I don't know,
I don't know

I'm sure that you can smell the spider
But did you know that thing was in your face?

I'm sure that you can smell the spider
But did you know that thing was in your face?

// Living Zoo //

We know where we wanna go
But we can't tell
On our own how to navigate
Our way through hell

Sometimes when you wake up
(Sometimes wake up lonely)
You feel alone
Somehow we get over it
(Somehow keep it going)
And you go on

Ahhh
That's alright
Ahhh
We're doing fine

They say there's a part of us
We can't explain
Please say you'll do anything
To make me stay

Being a human
Being an animal too
Being in a cage and
Being a living zoo

Being a person
Being an animal too
Being all alone and
Being all me and you

Cause we're lions in our cages
And tigers in tiny spaces

// On The Way //

On the way to Mars
We can reminisce a lot
Let's talk about the darkness and the stars
Talk about the people we might miss on earth

Untethered Moon

Now is all that matters
There's nothing in the past
But that's alright
We can see the stars in all directions
Now we see a tangled blur of white

Maltesian riot, Maltesian riot
Maltesian riot, Maltesian riot
Maltesian riot, Maltesian riot
Maltesian riot, Maltesian riot, riot, riot, riot

Now I guess I'll finally see
The kind of calmness chaos brings
I got so tired of going round and round
Waiting for gravity to bring me down

// Some Other Song //

I can't wait to get back home to you
Talk about the things that we've been through
There is nothing I would rather do
Something's gotta happen pretty soon

And it's some other song

I don't know exactly what you do
You are all I ever thought I knew
I can live without this feeling blue
I can live without it, how about you?

And it's some other song
Yeah it's some other song

I don't know how to never fall apart
Please tell me how to never fall apart
No matter how you ever fall
And it's some other song

I don't know how to never fall apart
Still wondering how to never fall apart
No matter how you ever fall
And it's some other song
Yeah it's some other song

// Never Be The Same //

Go everywhere you wanna go
See everything you wanna see
And everyone you wanna know

If that's what you want
You got it, you got it
If that's what you want

We would never be the same
We would never be the same

You've seen it all, you've seen it all
Seen it all, there's nothing else
You know it all, you know it all
Except to keep it to yourself

If that's what you think
You thought it, you thought it
If that's what you think

We would never be the same
We would never be the same

I know you got something
Everybody wants to know
I know you know something
Everybody's gotta know
I know you want something
Everybody's gotta go
I know you need something

And that's the way it's gonna be
Cause that's the way it's always been
And in another century
It's gonna be this way again

We would never be the same
We would never be the same
We would never be the same
We would never be the same

// C.R.E.B. //

yeah god don't know
believe me I believe that's true
every day I replace yesterday with my brain
every season passed twice
blame it on the C.R.E.B.

I never meant to forget you
I always forget people I really like
if I haven't seen em for a long time
and I haven't seen you for a long time

round, round and round it goes
till the full C.R.E.B. knock-out lets you know
now I'm one of them
how much of what I am depends upon the C.R.E.B.?

I never thought I'd forget you

yeah every season passes three times
I never wanna forget you
so if your name is ricky ticky ticky ticky
or if you go by ricky ticky ticky ticky
don't tell me you are ricky ticky ticky ticky
your hippocampus isn't unkind
your hippocampus isn't alright
your hippocampus isn't uptight
your hippocampus has it's own mind
your hippocampus never unwinds
your hippocampus isn't alright

// Another Day //

I can't explain anything to anyone
Don't believe that nothing isn't true
And you know you're not the one who gets to decide
What is right and what is right for you

And I wake up every day just the same
Somewhere between stars and sand
And I was made from material that could never last
An obsolescence that no one would have planned

And I know there's something deep inside
No one's gotta see it to make it real
And I don't expect anyone to read my mind
But when you don't I'm disappointed every time
And if somehow you make it through you're gonna find
I just want you to know how I feel

And our choices fade into the emptiness
Right before we start to fade ourselves
And now it seems like the only thing on my mind
Is getting all these things off my chest before I die
And going back to where the earth is soft to try to find
Somewhere we can bury all our mistakes

// Horizon To Cliff //

Out on the rise
High above the things that really matter
There's no surprise
Nothing's what it seems out on the rise

You can fight through all the reason
And wait another season
Forget about what you wanted
Forget your heart is haunted

Out on the rise
Out beyond the gravity of meaning
There's no surprise
So why would you drift
Horizon to cliff till you die

You can fight through all the reason
And wait another season
Forget about what you wanted

Well I guess I did my best to lock myself out
I even never hid a key

Now it's summer time and now it's winter time
Now it's summer time again

Out on the rise

// So //

Where where did you go
Why did you leave
What did you know
How how does it feel
When you're the one
Who is alone
Someone somewhere somehow said so

Up up every night
Down in my room
Out of my mind
Lost lost in the light
Looking for you I found
Nothing, nowhere, no one

If nobody came to the door
Then why would you open the door
If nobody came to the door
Then why would you open the door

If you through a party in everyone's snot
Would you open the door
And if you got in your but the windows were stars
Would you open the door

Where where did you go
Why did you leave
What did you know
How how does it feel
When you're alone

// When I'm Blind //

When will I realize when I'm blind
When will I realize when I'm blind

Stars fall down
Burn the ground
No one makes a sound

Waters rise
Drown the skies
No one seems surprised

I got lost
I got lost
I got lost

I got lost
I got lost
I got lost

When will I realize when I'm blind

When I'm blind I'll see
What is wrong with me

When will I realize when I'm blind

When I'm blind I'll see
What is wrong with me
