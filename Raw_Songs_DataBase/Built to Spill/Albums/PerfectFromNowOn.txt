Album: PerfectFromNowOn

// Randy Described Eternity //

Every thousand years
This metal sphere
Ten times the size of Jupiter
Flies just a few yards past the Earth

You climb on your roof
And take a swipe at it
With a single feather
Did it once every thousand years

Until you've worn it down
To the size of a pea
Yeah, I'd say that's a long time
But it's only half a blink in the place we're going to be

Where you going to be?
Where will you spend eternity?
I'm gonna to be perfect from now on
I'm gonna to be perfect starting now

Stop making that sound, stop making that sound
I will say I forgot it
It was only yesterday
And that's all you had to say

// I Would Hurt A Fly //

I can't get that sound you make out of my head
I can't even figure out what's making it
No one else around even seems to be noticing
It's only small enough for me

I can't get that sound you make out of my head
I can't even figure out what's making it
It feels like fingernails across the moon
Or do you rub your wings together?

There's a mean bone in my body
It's connected to the problems that I won't take for an answer
And I won't take that from you
Because I'd hurt a fly

Let you go to sleep
Feeling bad as me
Let you go to sleep
Feeling bad

There's a mean bone in my body
It's connected to the problems that I won't take for an answer
And I won't take that from you
Because I'd hurt a fly

// Stop The Show //

You don't tell me anything
It's not a dream, it's not a big lie
You're not going anywhere
You don't care, you think thats fine

You don't owe me anything
The offering is already mine
Your best friend is everywhere
They don't care, they think you're slime

You don't even know
What it means to
Take your own advice and then
Expect me to look surprised

After a while you know the style and that's enough to know they suck
And when you know to stop the show because you know they know
I know it's sad but don't feel bad, they knew they had it coming
After a while it hurts to smile and if you laugh, it's just a typical miracle

// Made-Up Dreams //

These thoughts are old
Let's keep it cold
Dry lines on me
Dry history

Dryology

That stupid sound
That awful feel
Don't bring them down
And it never will

No, it never will
No, it never will
No, it never will

Hard to believe
That after all this time
That after all this I'm
Still me

No one wants to hear
What you dreamt about
Unless you dreamt about them

Don't let that stop you
Tell them anyway
And you can make it up
As you go

I'm already gone now
You were outside, just waiting
I'm already nothing
You just noticed me fading

It takes a lot to make me crazy
And a lot is always going on

// Velvet Waltz //

If there's a word for you
It doesn't mean anything
I've got some words for you
They don't offer anything

You cold called everybody
But you haven't sold a thing
A bad idea gone funny
A pinch felt in a dream

You thought of everything
But some things can't be thought
You thought of everything
But one thing you forgot is you're wrong

And you better not be angry
And you better not be sad
You better just enjoy the luxury of sympathy
If that's a luxury you have

And you know no private bad
You know that that's the meaning of you're done
In a world that's not so bad
In a world time was killing in the sun

In a world that's not so bad
In a world time was killing in the sun
In the sun
In the sun

You took all that moment and kicked it in the sun
now it's gone because you left it in the sun
Was a brave idea, didn't mean no harm
Now it's burnt because you left it in the sun

Was a grave mistake
But how could you have known
The temperature, the distance of the sun

// Out Of Site //

Raised unright
So uptight
But why blame you?
You wouldn't be if you could choose

Most of the time it's out of site
It hit me today
Who gave who the right?
Who took mine away?

What a sight, what a sound
What a way to bring people down
What a way to bring me down

I know that you'll get yours when you get empty
It's so close
I'm sure that you would rather do that than be
In your clothes

You must have waited a long time
Bet you were disappointed
I waited longer than that
Just goes to prove

Proving's illogical
But sometimes necessary
Proving's illogical
But it's a cinch

Fa-la-la
Fa-la-la
But why blame you?
You wouldn't be if you could choose

Most of the time it's out of site
It hit me today
Who gave who the right?
Who took mine away?

What a sight, what a sound
What a way to bring people down
What a way to bring me down
It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

// Kicked It In The Sun //

Backwashed thoughts
And you made me talk
No, you made me listen

There's a feeling
From Ada to Irene
Theres something, theres nothing
You haven't seen

Tiny TV's on at 3
So serene
No place to be
Alone

So come on over, yeah
Let's sit down a little while
Some wine
You will find the same things

Same things, same things
Same things, same things

By the time you read this
You kicked it in the sun
It was all that you could do
How could you refuse?

You kicked it in the sun
It was all you had to do
You kicked it in the sun
It was all you had to do, how could you refuse?

And you kicked it in the sun
It was wrong and it was rude
And you kicked it in the sun
It was wrong and it was rude, how could you refuse?

And you kicked it in the sun

It's alright now
I'm getting over getting mine
It's alright now
I'm getting over getting mine

He seemed so unashamed of how he operated
Corresponds to the facts that you want
Despite his expectations he turned out mediocre
His master plan was so so

We're special in other ways
Ways our mothers appreciate
That net does not make me feel safe
All those holes make me nervous

He woke up late that morning
Went to the window and saw
The sun had stopped its shining
So, so

We're special in other ways
Ways our mothers appreciate
We're special in other ways
Ways our mothers appreciate

// Untrustable / Part 2 (About Someone Else) //

[Untrustable]

You can't trust anyone
'Cause you're untrustable
How can you trust someone
You know can't trust you?

You won't help anyone
'Cause you're unusable
No one can tie you down
No, you're nobody's fool

And I'd like to see it but it's something you just feel
And I'd like to feel it but it just isn't real
And god is whoever you're performing for
And god is whoever you perform for

You don't like anything
'Cause you're unlikable
All because you're not interested
In you anymore

It's so unthinkable
'Cause you don't think of it
How many ideas can fit
In your reality?

And I'd love to see it but it's something you just feel
And I'd like to feel it but it just isn't real

And I'd love to see it but it's something you just feel
And I'd like to feel it but it just isn't real
And god is whoever you're performing for
And god is whoever you perform for

[Pt. 2 (About Someone Else)]

I know you
Feel the things you see, you know they're true
What are you gonna do?

Why can't you
Empathize with Jesus' point of view?
What are you gonna do?

Can you feel the darkness shining through?
What are you gonna do?

Why can't you
Move yourself like other people do?
What are you gonna do?

I know you
Wouldn't be the way you feel if you could choose
What are you gonna do?

Can you feel the darkness shining through
What are you gonna do?

// Easy Way //

I cannot believe it took so long and we got so little done
Maybe I could see it, if we spent some time joking in the sun
Tried the easy way, it didn't work so we had to do the right way
But if you believed, then I guess you had to be let down

But how could we know that?
How could we have known that?

I cannot believe it took so long and we got so little done
Tried and tried and tried and tried and tried, ooh...
