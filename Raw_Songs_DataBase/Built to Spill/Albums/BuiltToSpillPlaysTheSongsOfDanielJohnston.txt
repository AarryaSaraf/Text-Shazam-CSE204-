// Bloody Rainbow //

Swirling hypnotic
Disrupts the girl
And the skull-headed spider
The milk was low cal
But what did it matter?
All of her hopes had been shattered
Thrilled to the minute
Bloody rainbow
Oh oh oh oh
Bloody rainbow

Away in her chamber
She remembers a love affair
Steamy hot romance
She couldn't care
Looking through her record collection
No one was there
Thrilled to the minute
Bloody rainbow
Oh oh oh oh
Bloody rainbow

She's always thinking
Things could turn out right
Like walking the dog
Or flying a kite
Systematic routine blight
All alone and lonely at night
She fell asleep with the TV on
Thrilled to the minute
Bloody rainbow
Oh oh oh oh
Bloody rainbow

What a tribulation
There's finally salvation for the dead
It's the good things that they said
It's the good things that they did
Thrilled to the minute
Bloody rainbow
Oh oh oh oh
Bloody rainbow
Oh oh oh oh
Bloody rainbow

// Tell Me Now //

You'll never know, dear, the tears that I cry
I don't wanna wait, girl, till the day that I die
Tell me now, oh-oh, do you really love me?
I don't understand the things that you do
You promised to make me the king of the zoo
Tell me now, oh-oh, do you really love me?

In this world
It's hard to find
A friend who cares
But if this really is love
Then lets get it on, on, on

I wanna know, dear, the way that you feel
I'm on a roll, girl, my heart's like a wheel
Tell me now, oh-oh, do you really love me?
If I could trust the look in your eye
What if your kiss could be a lie?
Tell me now, oh-oh, do you really love me?

In this world
It's hard to find
A friend who cares
But if this really is love
Then lets get it on, on, on

Tell me now, oh-oh, do you really love me?
Oh-oh, do you really love me?
Do you really love me?

// Honey I Sure Miss You //

Honey, I sure miss you
And I long to kiss you
And I miss you so much
Your loving touch

You brought out the best in me
Can you bring it back to me?
'Cause I love you so much
Your loving touch

Every time I think about you
Love comes down
But you're still not around

Honey, I sure miss you
And I wish you were here today
'Cause I want you so much
Your loving touch

Nothing more important to me
No one any more closer to me
'Cause I love you so much
Your loving touch

Every time I think about you
Love comes down
But you're still not around

Honey, I sure miss you
And I long to kiss you
And I miss you so much
Your loving touch

Every time I think about you
Love comes down
But you're still not around

// Good Morning You //

Good morning you
You've got the world, what's in your way
Good morning you
Had to stop to think of something to say

You sat in the chair and you were there
You looked at the wall and started to stare

Good morning you
What do you plan to do?
Good morning you
Though you can hardly move

You sat in a chair and you were scared
There's so much you could do if you dared

Good morning you
You've got the world, what's in your way?
Good morning you
Had to stop to think of something to say

Good morning you
You've got the world, what's in your way?

// Heart, Mind And Soul //

I thought I
Had it so bad
I didn't realize how much
I relied on you
More than just a memory
More like a feelin'
I'd remember every time
Anytime I needed it

Oh, and I needed it more
Than I could have imagined
'Cause this feelin' it ran deep
In my mind, my heart, and my soul

But late one night
I stumbled by the home
Cursing awful things
Hope she didn't hear me

Oh, but I think she did
As I hug my newfound sorrow
Oddly, it gives me strength
In my mind, my heart, and my soul

My heart sank
With the moon
On that horrible walk all alone
By the drive-in

Oh, and the night stood still
While lovers entwined on the screen on the hill
I knew somethin' had happened
In my mind, my heart, and my soul

That little grin
It meant so much
So sad, it's so sad
If it don't grin for me no more

Oh, but I hope you know better
I didn't mean what I was saying
But it's a fool that says I was only joking
In my mind, my heart, and my soul

Don't you mind me
If switch from first to the second person
I'm mixed up, I don't know
Who I'm talking to

Oh, but somethin's missin'
I hope I can bring it back
It's somethin' that I lack
In my mind, my heart, and my soul

Sorry
I'm sorry

// Life In Vain //

Don't wanna be free of hope
And I'm at the end of my rope
It's so tough just to be alive
When I feel like the living dead

I'm giving it up so plain
I'm living my life in vain
And where am I going to?

I've gotta really try
Try so hard to get by
And where am I going to?

I don't know where is up or down
And there ain't any love left around
Everybody's wearin' a frown
Waitin' for Santa to come to town

You're giving it up so plain
You're living your lives in vain
And where are you going to?

You've gotta really try
Try so hard to get by
Where are you going to?

Flip on your TV
Try to make sense out of that
If we were all in the movies
Maybe we wouldn't be so bored

We're giving it up so plain
We're living our lives in vain
And where are we going to?

We gotta really try
Try so hard to get by
And where are we going to?

// Mountain Top //

On top of a mountain top
I stoop and thought one day
I could really see a lot
And if I had my way

A lazy young sod I was
So deep in love those days
As if there was nothing was
But only love I crave

And so I didn't know as much
Her loving touch amazed
I was so gone with love
The alphabet was a haze

So alone as she pulls away
The funeral truck I cried
I gazed the clouds away
Like a Lost Christmas that day

And now I can't seem to cope
But only hope some way
Just to see her once more
And we could be friends like way back when

It's as if I'm already dead
And in my grave I lay
If only her love could save me now
And if some how she'd stay

// Queenie The Dog //

Queenie the doggie was a friend of mine
If only the money could save her now
Queenie the dog

Queenie the doggie, the special one
She always had the most fun most all of the time
Queenie the dog

She was all the laughing heard that sailed the ocean sea
She would talk the birds that walked, that cursed reality
Queenie the dog

Queenie was funny, she'd laugh at every joke
But we sure were surprised when she finally did spoke
Queenie the dog

Queenie the doggie sent down from heaven above
An angel in disguise filled with such love
Queenie the dog

Now and then I find myself listening to Queenie bark
At the twilight of the night as if I was a werewolf in the dark
Queenie the dog

She was the funny, the dog with only kind mind
The peace and the quiet I hope she will find
Queenie the dog

Queenie the doggie howling at the sun
Queenie the doggie, just to watch her puppies run
Queenie the dog

Somewhere I know she's laughing in the clouds
Just to see what it's all about
Queenie the dog

Queenie the doggie, there's only you and me
Queenie the doggie will live eternity
Queenie the dog

Love is an illusion, it plays with your brain
It's plain and it's simple, it's hard to explain
Queenie the dog
Queenie the dog

Queenie the doggie was a friend of mine
If only the money could save her now
Queenie the dog
Queenie the dog
If only the money could save her now
Okay

// Impossible Love //

You hurt me so bad
You were the best friend I ever had
Now I'm crawling in my shoes
Trying to get back to you

Impossible love
I just can't get to you
Impossible love
I'm tangled up in you

You left me so long
I can remember the times
How we really cared
All the dreams that we shared

Impossible love
I just can't get to you
Impossible love
I'm tangled up in you

My life just goes on
And what have I become?
You were the only one
You were my shining sun

Impossible love
I just can't get to you
Impossible love
I'm tangled up in you

I just can't believe that it's all over
I just want a chance to see you again

You were my one true love
With the light from above
And I'm hurting because
I want more of your love

But it's impossible love
I just can't get to you
Impossible love
I'm tangled up in you

// Fake Records Of Rock & Roll //

Get down, boogie like never before
Fake records of rock and roll
Hold on tight and don't let go
Fake records of rock and roll

When the people walk into that record store
Fake records of rock and roll

The people go shopping and they lay their money down
Fake records of rock and roll
Sounds just like, and the people don't know
Fake records of rock and roll

When they turn on that stereo
Fake records of rock and roll

Got their money and they lay it down
Fake records of rock and roll
Fork it over and they dig the sound
Fake records of rock and roll

They listen all day and they just don't know
Fake records of rock and roll

Well it used to be
You'd hear the rock and roll play
But the people nowadays
Just turn their heads and walk away
Since the day
The music died

Well it sounds just like shit to me
Fake records of rock and roll
The ruin of history
Fake records of rock and roll

Can't even get down and boogie
Fake records of rock and roll

// Fish //

Try aching every care in the world
She's only the most beautiful girl
The more I think it, the badder it gets
I was swimming along when I was caught in her net

She's got me singing with a broken heart
I keep on messing with my mind torn apart
She's only forgotten we've been left in the dust
I guess my art didn't help very much

Then the superlove got me again
Got me dreaming I could almost win
I stopped to take a look around with a grin
So much turmoil in this crazy town

She's got me bloodied from hitting the bricks
Is this the way the girlies get their kicks?
And now I see as if it makes a difference
Everyone in love, hating and hurting each other

Always thinking it's near the end
And I was hoping she'd be my friend
Lost forever, only wishing again
Oh, to be alive and free from sin

Psycho love in The Twilight Zone
Drippy soap opera on the telephone
I get so close, but I don't belong
Straining to identify with the radio song

Then I see her as if in a dream
It's so real, I could almost scream
She's doing her ritual, the same for any man
Like a movie, it's so deadpan

I'm looking for love in the darkness
I haven't a chance at false romance
Maybe next time I'll whisper something new
I'm so ashamed, so unglued

I've had enough and she'll never know
I feel like staying, but my subconscious says, "Go"
Shed a tear like blood on the floor
It's only love and nothing more

She's got me singing with a broken heart
I keep on messing with my mind torn apart
She's only forgotten we've been left in the dust
I guess my art didn't help very much
