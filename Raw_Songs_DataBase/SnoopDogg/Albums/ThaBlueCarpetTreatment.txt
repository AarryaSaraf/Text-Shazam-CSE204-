Album: ThaBlueCarpetTreatment

// Intrology //

[George Clinton]
As I take another choken toke of icky sticky stanky
Stuff a bull, pack a pipe, twist a blunt, roll and light a joint
Lean back and puff slow [echoes]

[Snoop Dogg]
Whenever I'm making a record, I'm getting into my character
And I'm trying to to portray something that I'm feeling so that way the whole world can believe in it

Do anybody know my name!?
[crowd cheers]

What's my name!?
(Snoop Dogg!)
What's my name!?
(Snoop Dogg!)
Hold on, I want y'all to say my name like dis..

(Snoop, Snoop, Snoop, Snooooop)

There are seven wonders in the world, you're about to witness the eighth

[Jay-Z sample:] Nigga ask about me, nigga ask about me!

You don't believe me? Motherfucker say what!?
Aiyyo Cat, roll out the blue carpet cause
Lemme C-walk on these niggas

Blue hat, blue socks, blue shoes, too cool
Blue car, blue house, blue pit, blue pool
Blue grass, blue Coupe, blue b-ball hoop
What kind of phone you on Loc? I'm on the Bluetooth
Talking to my nephew, my nigga Boo, half who?
He make pimping on a bitch look so cool
Old school, old fools, steel on a nigga first
Run up with that punk shit and I fill up a nigga's shirt
Do it to it hurt 'cause it hurt so bad (so bad!)
Snoopy D O dub they can't touch yo' swag (yo' swag!)
Oh mark ass nigga better tuck yo' flag
'Cause when my music out loco, I come to smash yo' ass
Fuck him, fuck her, and fuck all y'all too
(He wants everything to be right) 'Cause I'm... (Snoop Dogg!)
I'm so hood, so true
and every time that you see me cause, I'm oh so blue!
(To get that you have to stay.. on top of your game)
(And learn the most specific lesson...)
That shit is dope right there God...

// Think About It //

Yeah man...

"You know it's easy to talk about.. doin somethin
but when it comes down to the action part, the most folks take a little
light vacation"

[Snoop Dogg]
Mmmm.. I was just thinkin to myself man
Y'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me
And I need to let my peoples know how deep it is to me
On some real talk like...

It's like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low
Nobody's guidance so I decided to sleep by the do'
Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'
Driftin off into another stage of life
Nigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight
Niggaz ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no
Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open ya eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once ya decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin naughty
Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body
It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest
You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it

[Snoop Dogg]
Fuck that nigga, I'ma do it right
Thangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like
for me to be mad, saying, "Niggaz can't stand me"
Sittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's
Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl
Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow
They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though
In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI
Takin my time, chronolizing my rhyme
Writing my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual
Directing the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual
Tryin to change the direction of flowin
And sayin, born sayin, "You know I get live-er when I get fluent"

Ain't been nobody to change game since King came
Same thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable
And they don't know how to do it 'cause they don't flow that way
Go that way, roll that Jay
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony
You're so into what ya doin but you can't get into it
You can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'ma do it
And now you doin it, they booing like, "You blew it! You blew it!"
I'm dippin through the universe, make 'em move the verse
Through the Luda-verse, hit the boota first
You can never beat a hoe, lemme show you how to treat a hoe
If you likin me, follow me, you so believable
(So...) Got a way to get his own music out
Record executive, bounce ballin and actin bad
Take my time, with my.. great mind
Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it
Thanks to niggaz who might make it illegal
And not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples
And fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters
And hittin y'all with heaters and walkin in my Adida's
I continue to bust, then I switched up to chucks
Givin niggaz a puff, still givin it up
Beanie Sigel what up? Real niggaz is up
On the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
We bust 'til we buss 'em up
(Lay Low), I know they told you not to fuck with us
Layin and playin, and sayin man, walkin in vain
Anxious for fame, my nigga tryin to walk in my lane
And tryin to.. walk in my shoes but they just don't fit
You couldn't spit the shit that I spit 'cause I'm the shit
And this is it, legit, let's split the chips
And fix, and move the work and hurt that bitch
I'm through with this! [crowd cheers]

// Crazy //

[gun shots]
"Black folks can't never have no fun!"

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
These streets beeeee walking down the avenue
(Crazy!) From Hollywood to South Central!
These streets beeeee.. crazy!
Long Beach to Comptoooon!
Always up to no good! Craaaaaaaa
(Crazy!) Crazy..
Always up to no good!
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
(Crazy!)

[Snoop Dogg]
Have a look outside and take a stroll with me
California lifestyle, you wanna roll with me?
I can take you in and out and where it's gonna be
Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me
I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong of me
I'ma stay down, you see me on them corners G
At your local liquor store, getting some optimums
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost
A-humph.. yeah, I love my folks
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats
On the real no.. the streets'll have you
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
Yeah, see you gradually grow
and when you walking on my side I think you all need to know...

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
On the 110 Freeway flo', back to the block
In the seven deuce Coupe, hopping hipping the hop
Sipping on some Henn with my nephew Infrared
Young pimp on the grind tryna line up some head
Had fun, did, done, on the West we run
Don't matter where you from, if you old or young
Seesaw we raw like ooohhh-la-la
Fuck the law we don't get caught we just do-da-da
Yeah nigga we shaking the cops
You niggas out there just be making it hot
But don't trip if you faking a lot
I'll break you, shake you, and take yo' spot
[singing] Because if you think that you gonna slip through California
without getting banged on.. brother you're wrong

[Break: Nate Dogg]
(Always up to no good!) I really love my dog, grew up together and all but he
(Always up to no good!) Hell yeah I love New York
that's why I married the broad but she
(Always up to no good!) We can't hang 'em up 'cause I'm a balla y'all and he
(Always up to no good!) Let me tell you about these streeeets
(Always up to no good!)

[Chorus w/ the phrase "Always up to no good!" at the beginning of each line]

// Vato //

Man, don't you know that I'm loco?

I was chilling right around my way
21st Eastside at the beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talking shit with his homies
Like he was a straight G!

Asking where I'm from while he running up
Gangbang my set on everyone of them
(20s nigga)
Some things, sons they just won't change
Fools don't respect nothing but the gangbang

What's seen is what's sawn
Dogg is the law
I have you niggas running like a marathon
Lil G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talking 'bout they gon' get my chain, and they gon' leave with it

But they don't know
Once they get close
It's tic tac toe
Three motherfuckers laid on the floor
(Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray
I heard an ese say
He said

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopy—he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Blaow!
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

Blaow
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's 3 motherfuckers dead, and I ain't seen shit
But these niggas 'a scream with plea
But for a G like me it's just a case
Really you could see

I crack the Mac back
And pop off rolling
And smack your neck back
You drop off falling
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me

Fuck that. I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl
You would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all? Been a Dogg
Smoke you like a menthol

You think you know?
But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dough?
What the fuck? No

See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed
All you'll hear my enemies going

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopy—he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Blaow!
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

Blaow
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth
God damn
And Snoop 'a keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets
Run with them niggas with the heat

You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be beast of the East, motherfucker

I never hesitate to blaze
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team 'cause my peoples
Are screaming that we need more
For fun or is it legal

Put the bang on this song
Make it feel like a drive-by
It's a shame but somebody gotta die
They say it happens state to state
But when I mobbing LA
All I hear the eses say
They go

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopy—he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Blaow!
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

Blaow
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom
With the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like

Blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like

In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style
I'm like

Snoop Dizzle (Hey)
Your boy Kells (Hey)
Let me hear you say
That's that shit

[Snoop Dogg]
Let's get this party jumpin'
Me and Kel gone get it bumpin'
They humpin'
Like when it's over
We gone all get into somethin'
The Dog is fresh
Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest
But these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess
That in the Chi is so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind
But Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test
You fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago
Let me get you to this real west
It's real strong
Real fat and real long
Doggies in the building
Holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it
Something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home
Work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown
Put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it
T-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin'
Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone
You might get this dog bone

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom
With the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like

[Snoop Dogg]
Dip low, Six-Four
Hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor
Cuz they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball
Get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle
Now make that shit fall
Not just one, but all y'all
Move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me
Work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it
Is that your crew
Bring 'em too
Come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it
We can get this after party
Poppin' everybody
Got themselves another body
Knockin' out
Without protection though
That's my confession
But at the spot
If you just think
Your gonna listen
You can drop it like it's hot
Hold up
I came to cool out
Lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin
A couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it
But now it's known
That this cash shit
Kells sing that song

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom
With the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like

In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style

And if you're ever in the 2-1-3

I'm in the back of the club
Blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like
That's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style
I'm like

Snoop Dizzle (Hey)
Your boy Kells (Hey)
Let me hear you say
That's that shit

Get it how you want it
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner
While I, taadow, check out this bizarre
The D-A-T the N-I double G, the D-A-Z
Again it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for shit

Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches
Hit the gas, hit the brake, y'all really burn rubber?
Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip!

[Kurupt]
Yeah, nigga.. shot caller
It's America's number one baller
Man I don't give a fuck.. like, "Fuck it"
High riders.. slide in the bucket
Little momma all up on a nigga like a coat
I got the perfect thang that'll coat her throat (Candy!)

[Chorus w/ two extra lines]

[Snoop Dogg over Chorus]
Candy! So tasty.. candy, candy!
Yeah! Ha ha! Yeah nigga, we got that candy man

West, west y'all! [echoes]

// Gangbangn 101 //

[Snoop Dogg]
West Coast... it's time to stand up nigga
We gon' unite 'round this motherfucker one time
I'm callin' every real Crip nigga
and every real B-Dogg, to the table right now
Yeah... we gon' push a real line right now
See if y'all with this real gangsta guerrilla shit

Have you ever seen 100,000 Rip riders from the side
Blue Chuck's, blue rags, grey clouds, blue skies
On the move, can't lose, Hill Street blues
Niggaz gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray
these suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news
She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park
And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail
4800 with this Crippin', oh well
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail
He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right
Eyes open 'cause niggaz get stuck on seez-ight
It ain't no motherfuckin' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock
Never flip-flop, 20 Crippin' til I drop

[Chorus]
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip

[The Game]
Is I, in the motherfuckin' S-5
With the red bandana double knotted 'round the rearview
Niggaz see clear through, they know that it's Game
Cherry red Lowenhart's let 'em know that I bang
So bang, like Snoop in "Deep Cover"
I got the seat reclined, fo-five under the white-T, smothered
Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies
Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy
And bang for my niggaz locked up, they can't stop us
It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up
I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on
Hughey P. Lewis with Air Force One's on
I gangbang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams
Red Lambo', red bandana print ceilin'
Me and Snoop got the West Coast locked
Red and blue rag tied in a knot
With all my motherfuckin' homies yellin' out

[Chorus]
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

[The Game]
I ran outta gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck
Ain't no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's
Hopped out the '6-trey, nowhere to go
Til' Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler '6-4
We "Just Dippin", one Bloodin' one Crippin'
I'm on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott' Pippen
Moral is, my bandana hangin' from the left side
So if you ain't a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside

[Snoop Dogg]
(What up Blood?) Yeah cuz, we just tippin'
Me and Game doin' thangs, switchin' lanes, Hurricanes on my feet
Stop, and C-Walk to the beat
Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st Street
Eastside LBC, gun in my hand
It's the turf by the surf but we don't play in the sand
We just - slip and slide out, we Rip and ride out
Let it C known, nigga welcome to the Thunderdome

[Chorus]
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip...

// Boss' Life //

[Snoop Dogg]
Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
So many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the Bs and the Cs, and the Ds and the Hs
And the Gs putting work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really
A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living
Show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll. Don't get it twisted
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with something pimpish
And it's coming from the beach where them niggaz is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga.. the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish

[Chorus – Akon or Nate Dogg:]
See me man, I'm nothing like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm leaning in my ride, fo' fifth, cock banging
Me, I'm riding by ya on the corner, block slangin
I'm living that boss' life (life)
The hoes come running when they see me coming
I'm living that boss' life (life)
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money (my money)

[Snoop Dogg]
This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggaz with the platinum mouths
Thinking that they blessed by the actions that be coming out
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But tricking ain't the route (route), that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holding it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fucking with it for a dollar
If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breaking out (Tha Doggfather)
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, having diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
Walking on the blue carpet with the Doctor (Doctor)

[Chorus]

// LAX //

"Oh... Cali?
"No doubt"

"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby" - [x4]

[Snoop Dogg]
West West y'all, pile it on your plate
A little somethin' somethin' from the Golden State
Nah, we ain't like Kobe and Shaq
It's Magic and Kareem nigga, Showtime is back
True legends, two steppin' on you peasants
What y'all thought, y'all gon' need bout two vests'
Cause we he plug, I plug
Mixed shot with the slug, listen here cuh
when I dig dug - play slick and get stuck
But don't play tough boy, go and get it up
Hey yo Cube, tell me this
Why half of the homies gettin' worked by a bitch?
Then they fall in love and get hurt by a bitch
Nine months later cause got mirked by a bitch
See I'm just a nigga that ya don't wanna
Reverse the game on her, put the bitch on a corner
Welcome to California

"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
(Welcome to Cali)

[Ice Cube]
Come hit the town, drop down nigga
L-A-X, top down nigga
I'm scoopin' you up, ya rollin' or what?
I know what ya came for, I'm rollin' it up
Snoop Dogg nigga, y'all hold up
Never thought Ice Cube would show up
But I'm in the studio gettin' fucked up
with a beat from Battlecat, a nigga lucked up
I got my hustle down, look and learn
See how a hot nigga, cook and burn
A nigga earn like David Stern
mixed with Big Worm when he off that sherm
Now - bust a u-turn, come by your hood
For motherfuckers that think I went Hollywood
Pick a Coast, it got to be the West
I live out there, from the W.S. nigga

"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
"LAX"
(Welcome to Cali)
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
"LAX"
(Welcome to Cali)
"Oh... Cali?"

"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"

[Ice Cube]
Fell asleep on the plane, and so did he
Woke up chillin' in the LBC
I grew up in the HNC
But that ain't what I turned out to be
Understand me that I'm still a G
who ain't never spent a day in the penitentiary
Now I'm rappin' with Snoop D-O double-G
And got the whole fuckin' world nigga lovin' me

[Snoop Dogg]
Yep yep, they love him to death
Cause he walk under water, without gettin' wet
Roll through the neighborhood without gettin' checked
So gone and so blown, are we there yet?
You wonder why I got the S on my chest
cause I'm a motherfuckin' vet from the Wild Wild West
I used to sing "Bennie and the Jets"
Nigga so boss now I sip Henny on my jets
From the East back to the West

"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
(Welcome to Cali)
"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"

// 10 Lil' Grips //

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Ten little Crip niggaz runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggaz a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggaz a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season

[Snoop Dogg]
The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
The gangsta mack, in a gangsta 'llac
Hmm.. fools be like, "Break off some cheese"
Friends and enemies, aww nigga please
Fuck, you thought who pumped you up
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
It's all similar to gettin laaaid
on ya back when the motherfuckin K spraaays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit (ignit)
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em
Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby
Gangstas real, they pop the pill
You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit
Fuck a honey dip.. 'cause I got money to get
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this
Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this
Keep a strap in ya pocket when ya tip through the towns
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean, so green, crip back to the block
Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got
It's a gangsta jack (gangsta jack), in gangsta black (black)
And they thought we just gangsta rapped
Yeah nigga, we take your snaps
Your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks (It's like that?)
It's like that!

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of killin when you on the Eastside
Eastside, yeah nigga we ride

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg (singing)]
They say it's crazy out here, it ain't no more fun
I can't walk down the street without my gun, gun

// Round Here //

[Chorus - X2]
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggaz quick to air ya out
and lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya
in the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

[Snoop Dogg]
M.L. and 21st, where niggaz worse
Quick to put one in ya first
Before they search your pockets get that china
And where they got ya that's where they gon' find ya
They rollin' out there nigga, that's that real shit
Where bein' slick can get you caught up real quick
Hold up homie, don't let this money blind ya
Cause you won't see me standin' right behind ya
Then it's time's up, that's how we talkin' if he come from the Beach
Better watch them niggaz out here if they come from the East
Don't stop if I'm not out somewhere so niggaz can see
Cause they don't give a fuck, you stuck if you ain't with me
My city's a beast..
You can't walk through the Beach unless you walk with a piece
You can't talk to police 'cause most police is like me
They get that cheddar like they want it, take yo' shit in the street
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

[Chorus - X2]
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggaz quick to air ya out
and lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya
in the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

[Snoop Dogg]
This L.A. County nigga
If you's a bitch then get yo' ass from 'round here nigga
Before they come put bullets in yo' brain
Cause in the hood ain't nothin' really changed
They tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam
And just like Sam niggaz just don't give a damn
They mission is to leave yo' ass in pain
Cause they don't give a fuck about a thing
It's a cold game, that's how they talkin' if they walk on the West
Better watch yourself without this star protectin' your chest
These niggaz come from nowhere, get to takin' yo' shit
You'll get beat outside the set and then sent home in your stretch
This shit is a mess..
You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest
You can't talk to police 'cause most police ain't gon' stress
They get that cheddar like they want it with they foot in your chest
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

[Chorus - X2]
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggaz quick to air ya out
and lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya
in the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

// A Bitch I Knew //

Good evening ladies and gentlemen
[scratched:] "Let's describe a certain female"

[Chorus: Snoop]
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy

[Snoop Dogg]
It all goes back, to '85
When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-oh-6
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
It's real in the field, no mistakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listenin to "One Love"
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'ma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He said, "Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
and make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?"
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimpin, out in D.C.
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young hoe with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a hoe in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little hoe I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went "Ahhh"
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a hoe
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
better move on somethin fast if I thought I
could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice
Now what it do, what it is
Now you livin with that hoe and y'all got fo' kids

Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy

You don't have to break it down to the floor (c'mon, yeah)
All you gotta do is keep movin your hands like this

[Damani]
I throw my hands like Marvin
Sorta like James Brown how I +Get Down+

// Imagine //

[Snoop Dogg]
Yo Doc what up my nigga
Snoop Dogg, it is what it is
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man
And i think it's time for me and you to just
Turn it down a bit
Come on

[Dr. Dre]
Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin'
Imagine niggaz trapped
Imagine it havin' action
Imagine how niggaz could be actin'
If you never got this shit crackin
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine it's like livin' in city of god
You feel me
Imagine life on the yard
I'm tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' call pop 'bout one
Imagine a mother strugling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son
Imagine life you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz
When you put back to the streets you get right back in
Imagine Russell still strugling
No Def Jam it's anotoher nigga hustlin'
And no rocks on them fellaz
Just rocks on them fellaz
Just try and keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggaz just stoped
From the east to the west coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination
To know niggaz been bless with
HIP-HOP

[Chorus]
Before we go
Can you imagine?
Picture years, with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life.

[Snoop Dogg]
Could you imagine bein' lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jails
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggaz at ya when you done fo'
Remember when they asks ya why ya run for and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
We act like we hate to see you gun hoe
But just imagine if the rappin' got the gun no but you already know.
Imagine niggaz in the LBC felt just like Snoop Dogg & D-R-E,
And felt just like the niggaz in the 2-1-3.
Then imagine us was comin' when you fuckin' with me.
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean imagine we said fuck this shit
Imagine if my niggaz got together and tow up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growin' up in the jail done
Happy just to be alive' watching all your people run
Would you imagine growin' up to sell your 50 million records world wide or fuckin' on somebodies son
Imagine if these niggaz neva saw a colour
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggaz kill each other
All the drunk fool gets pissed on balls
He fuckin' off my niggaz, they gone murder us all
Imagine that

[Chorus]

// Conversations //

[Snoop Dogg]
Brothers is wack by popular demand
Chasin fame and girls livin they life on cruise control
But tell me; what do it profit a man
to gain a whole world livin trife but then lose his soul?
I'm here to wake my peoples up from they dreamin
Kill every demon and snakes that make, even feds steamin
Even though my star gleamin man my life ain't trouble-free
Homie take it from me, Snoopy D-O-double-G

[Stevie Wonder]
It's no better people who have left the problems of today
Leavin to conclude that for their life is not the way
But every problem has an answer, and if yours you cannot find
You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you piece of mind
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood
Heyyyyyyeahhhheyyyy

[Snoop Dogg]
So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed
Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong
Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have
As God blessed the child that can go get his own
And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feelin like this life is a trip
Tryin to keep our hearts pure through the sins
But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich
But to them they can endure to the end and win

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood... yeahhhheyyyy
[scatting to a harmonica]
Out here the only free psychiatrist, that's known throughout the world
Is fall in love by walks of all men and women, it's all boys and girls
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood

[Snoop Dogg]
Whether it's soldiers on the cell block or homies on the run
With God, man ain't no obstacles that you can't overcome

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood

[Snoop Dogg]
You're so frustrated, worryin 'bout your bread
And some mornings, you don't even wanna get out the bed

[Stevie Wonder]
When you lose too much too baaaaaaad
Just go talk to God and prayyyyy

[Snoop Dogg]
And you's a good women, but you can't understand
why it seems like you ain't never gon' find yourself a good man

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too HARRR-ARRRRRD
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood

[Snoop Dogg]
Mothers on welfare or ladies that's strippin
You under so much pressure, feel like your sanity's slippin

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd!
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood, hmmm
He'll never never let you down

[S.W.] You know that, don't you Snoop?
[Dogg] You know I know it Uncle Steven
[S.W.] Oh I know that too, we know it
[Dogg] Yeah we do
[S.W.] Thanks a lot man
[Dogg] Nah thank you man I appreciate that, you know I love you
[S.W.] And I love you for what you sayin
[Dogg] God bless you

[Snoop Dogg]
And you can catch me down on my knees, askin the Lord please
Even Jes' pray, hey, with difficulty comes ease
There's disease, poverty, congestion or oppression
I'm askin for your protection and thanking you for your blessing
Confession is good for the soul, that's how I'm tryna roll
Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates now that's the goal
Until then, forgive my sin if that ain't askin too much
Now that's tabernacle, chuuuch!
