Album: DeathRowTheLostSessionsVol1

// Soldier Story (Intro) //

[Snoop Dogg:]
Remember man, '92, me, Dre, Tha Pound, Rage, it was just all about, you know what I'm sayin', Death Row
As time went by, you know, niggas start having money, success, bitches, weed, cars, homes, you know what I'm sayin', the flyest shit
Along with that comes jealousy, envy, destruction, and along those lines run life and death
You know, so a few years went by, a couple albums, success, out of the blue sky Dre departs, he leaves us
Death Row, will we sink or will we stay afloat?
Later on that year, I lose my nigga Pac, damn, it's a cold world
Guess it's all on me, Death Row for life
Gotsta handle my business...on the frontline....as usual

[Bloodstone Sample:]
Oh but what will you say
If I never set foot in your door again
What will you say to your friends then
Will you tell them
Who has the last laugh now

// Doggystyle //

[George Clinton:]
Yeah, this is a story about a famous dog
Doggy Dogg that is
That smooth macadamian, a.k.a Silky Slim
Back in the motherfuckin' house for nine-trey
Why must he be like that?
Why would any other dog hit it from the back?
It's in his nature, it's Doggystyle baby

[George Clinton (Jewell):]
(Oh I, oh I) It's Doggystyle (oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh)
Doggystyle (I)
Doggystyle, it's Doggystyle
(Oh I, oh I) Yeah it's Doggystyle (oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh)
It's Doggystyle yay (I)

[Snoop Dogg:]
It's like tonight is the night by Betty Wright
It's my first piece of ass and it's awfully tight
But I'm still finna handle my business like a dog
Feeling that pussy, yes y'all
So lay back baby girl, and take a trip with me
I got the drink on deck, so take a sip with me
Drip with me, while I swing my thang
Reminiscing 'bout the first time Doggy Dogg came

[Jewell (George Clinton):]
It's time to take you motherfuckas down memory lane
(Memory lane, memory lane, Doggystyle)
It's time to take you motherfuckas down memory lane
(Down memory lane, Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (yeah) I (yeah, Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, (yeah) oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (yeah, Doggystyle)
I (Doggystyle)

[Snoop Dogg:]
It was a hot sunny day in the month of May
I'm next door to the house with my homie J
Instead of being at school, I'd rather ditch and shit
Cause at one-forty-five I got a bitch to get with
Even though I'm young, I'm kind of real good
With working my thang to get a bitch sprung
She gazing in the mirror and shit
Cause once I'm in it from the back all I'm hearing is shit is

[Jewell (George Clinton):]
Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
(I can see it)
I will do things to blow your socks off
(I can feel it)
Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
(Doggystyle, Doggystyle)
I will do things to blow your socks off
(Yeah)

[Snoop Dogg:]
A little something for the bitches thats down with me
Keep it low as you creep and get around with me
Don't be afraid like Erin ho
You know you want to fuck your nigga Doggy Dogg
Have you ever had your [?] tongue licked and shit?
While your nigga's in the county and you eating a dick
The position I'm fishing and wishing for
Is doing it Doggystyle, bitches blow

[Jewell (George Clinton):]
Oh I, oh I (oh yeah), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(Doggystyle, doing it Doggystyle) I (do it Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I (oh let me feel it), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(I can see it, I can see it) I
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (Doggystyle)
I (Doing it Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh (doing it Doggystyle)
uh oh oh-o-oh I (oh yeah, I can see it)
Oh I, oh I (oh I want to feel it), oh-o-o-o-oh

Oh I, oh I (I can feel it) oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh I

// Fallin' Asleep On Death Row //

One lil, two lil, three lil G's
Hangin' on the dope spot slangin' they keys
Four lil, five lil, six lil cops
Leanin' in the cut, 'bout to get popped
Not, knowin' I'm scopin' on the roof
I got my red beam, better have ya bulletproof
Cause the light don't miss once I put it to ya dome
They got my homies jacked, now they reachin' for they chrome
Al Capone was a hero of mine
I've shot plenty niggas and cops, so fuck one time
Where they at? where they at? Oh, they in the back
So I gotsta take my time and make sure that my nine
Get him, got him, spot him, shoot him, he's shot
And now they call me Snoop Gotti
I'm like a fugitive, Harrison Ford
Slidin' in the Chevy now the shit's gettin' heavy
But you know I can't choke so I call my nigga Loc
Gotta find the hideaway and a big bag of smoke
Can't be fuckin' wit' my niggas while they makin' they dope
Cause if ya slippin', ya fallin' asleep on Death Row

Now some muthafucka done snitched on me
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin' through the county main line
Back in 9500, just tryna handle mines
Spittin' game at my homies about the good ol' days
As we try to pass time, waitin' for the chains
To Chino, I see no reason to cry
When a nigga's still alive, right?
Five o'clock wake up, call roll, call Doggy Dogg
Be at the chow hall from there I roam the yard
Still representin' to the fullest, so you know what time it is
I shank a nigga in a minute, abiding rules of the pen
I adapt quick, don't take shit from no nigga
Hittin' pushups by the g's to get bigger
Eight months, I'm on swole, my mind's clearer
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And guess what the fuck I'm startin' to see
I still regulate sleepin' in the penitentiary

// Eat A Dick //

It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearing muthafuckas tryna steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped in the door
You know some of you niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Why? hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I kick in the doors
Put my nuts on ya chin and the story goes

Why do bitch-ass niggas always talk shit
But don't when it's time to get wrecked, checked, and ripped?
I knew he was a hoe
Ready to turn a trick and I can tell from his lips that my dick would fit
I've split, gums
You didn't know dumb-da-ditty-dumb
And my shit do harm so run, ring the alarm
I thought you knew I'm looney like Tony Montana
In the mix running shit, oops and um...
The smoothest, coolest, ruthless ya know
On a kamikaze mission (ooh, if I can be like Snoop)
Keep wishing, listen
With my balls in ya jaws, make room to put my dick in

// Hoez //

Bi-itch
Yeah, now we gonna talk about these hoes for a minute (talk about these, let's talk about these hoes)

There's some hoes in this house
There's some hoes in this house
If you see 'em turn 'em out
There's some hoes in this ho-ow-ow

Bitch, why you looking at my dick?
Acting like you wanna blow a dick
Yeah, I know he know a bitch
Got my homie, and we all out to get laid
Seen this bitch on stage
Live, right, get it goin', don't stop
Panties drop, hit the floor
Don't act like you new to this hoe, I seen you before
Yeah, you don't remember me, cause I ain't have no loot
Now bitch, you tryna act cute
Pull up your skirt, do it like it's 'sposed be done
Ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
And after we get to ya, get with ya
Get through ya, stick dick to ya
Got my niggas in here motivated
Heated, gang related
[?], and it's like this
[?] bitch

This is for my homeboys
Let's show 'em how we get-get down
Show 'em how we -get down
Show 'em how we beat it to the beat of Tha Pound
Don't mind, it's just a pimp thang
Money with me every time, it's a grip thang
Short and simp' thang, get it like you want it
With the shake of Dogg on it
Go on do it like you want it
Baby lick it good-
Hip, big tits, shit's so thick
Baby flossin' that kitty, I ain't bullshittin' bitch
Go on, do what ya gotta do, baby lick it so tend'

Do ya see what I see? (hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (see 'em, turn 'em out)
Do ya see what I see? (hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (when you see 'em, turn 'em out)

Trip, now Daz, Luke, Kurupt, and Snoop
Come bangin' all the hoes in ya muthafuckin' group
It's a shame, how my game
Gon' get that pussy for me in a minute mane
There's hoes all over this place, I bumped a hoe from Atlanta
Named Nevanah, and I, ran a, plan up
That I had designed for another bitch named Savannah
Man I, had a lot of hoes in my lifespan
Even had a bitch from Iran named Jan
Not to mention Japan, I had a tight-eyed hoe with dough
Ya know? Fo' sho'
Now ya know I can bump 'em
So when they get out of line I won't hesitate to dump 'em
Cause I was taught not long ago
In order to gain a hoe, you gotta lose a hoe
That's why my stable, keeps me able
To buy nice cars, homes, and cables
Gangsta haters, a question for y'all
Why yo' bitch paws in my draws, holding on my balls?

You act like you don't do it
But you know ain't nuthin' to it
Don't play like you ain't been through it
Fit to blow dick like ain't nuthin' to it

One for the money, two for the hoes
Seen 'em all coming, they coming in rows
Bitches ain't shit, so I suppose
Your bitch is different, in different clothes
Hell nah she ain't, she's just an average hoe
That gives the average dick the average blow
Don't play, don't look at me that way
Don't switch, I know a bitch when I see a bitch
I know a hoe when I see a hoe
DPG done get blowed in some [?]

Baby sit back, with your bad self
You ain't never ever had a piece of ass n'em
Once you get it butt-nekkid get to mackin' 'em
And she worked it on a nigga so [?]
I get nasty, when you least expect
Get fine drunk hoes to get butt-nekkid
We don't be trippin' when walk inside the club
Find me a freak by the name of love
She love, wants a girl that like that dick
Plus like that clique and like freaky shit
You wonder why we bring these hoes
These types of clothes, so we suppose
Spit this game, once you think you know it
These freaky hoes is good to go

Do ya see what I see? (there's some hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (if ya see 'em, turn 'em out)
Do ya see what I see? (there's some hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (if ya see 'em, turn 'em out)

Man, this nigga right back in the club looking for some love
Standing at the bar with a pocket full of dubs
Paying some bitch, to make your dick get hard
Cause you's a muthafuckin' trick
I gets, niggas like you's on the regular
Send a hoe at ya, then look at ya
Right where I want ya at
Make sure you won't get no get-back
I learned from the best pimps in the game
I got hoes all over, my best hoe's Nova
I know ya tried to come over
And get at her, it really didn't matter
I had her, ready to cock back the hammer
And jam her, 9-double-M in your face
While you dance to the boogie of the bass
You chase hoes, I place hoes in they place, nigga

Now let me tell you som' right, a lot of niggas don't understand (nah they don't understand) how real pimps and real players handle their shit (they don't understand, know what I'm talkin' about)
Ya know, aye, me and my man, Dogg (tell 'em), you know we just puttin' hoes in they place, we pimpin' hoes (pimpin' hoes), laying hoes down (slamming Cadillac doors)
You know, a hoe is gonna be a hoe (hoe gon' be a hoe)
Some of y'all niggas don't understand that (yo' hoe be a hoe, let the hoe be a hoe fool)
So, so don't act like you don't do it (cause you know ain't nuttin' to it), cause you know ain't nuttin' to it
Just like we said, aye, hoes gon' be hoes (lay yo' bitch down, lay yo' bitch down, lay yo' bitch down, yuh, yuh), niggas gon' be niggas
We gon' get ours
Aye, y'all hoes gon' be mad
