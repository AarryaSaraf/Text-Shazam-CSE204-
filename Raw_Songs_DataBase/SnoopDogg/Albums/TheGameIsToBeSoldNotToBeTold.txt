// Slow Down //

Slow down cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Slow down baby, slow down baby)
It's wicked in these streets
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Ohhhhhhhhh, slow down)
It's wicked in these streets

[Snoop:]
Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smoking 
I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny, on how shit be
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a nigga's just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here dog, a hoe once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it with rich niggas
Nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop niggas in rap
And when we get to spittin' make sure y'all step back
You with that? Cause if you ain't clown,
We from the D-O double G, we groupie true, and slow down

Slow down (slow down now) cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(I can't take the heat, I can't take the heat)
It's wicked in these streets
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Ohhhhhhhhhh, slow down)
It's wicked in these streets

[Mia X:]
Ayyo Snoop (I used to)
I used to cook up dope, ride with niggas
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for the jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping hit the club and then ???
Never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age, but they call me Mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all, for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I
Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down

Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Slow down baby)
It's wicked in these streets (Slow down baby)
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Slow down, slow down)
It's wicked in these streets

[Mia X:]
Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records for my come up
From sun up to sun down, I'm trying to get my money
Hata's ain't gon' stop me cause hatas can't run me
It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Every body seemed glad, but now they ?????
Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down
Snoop:
I got niggas shot niggas drop niggas for fun
I ????? from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the nineties, and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump
You don't wanna get caught up in my mix
Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch
We don't neva eva, talk no shit
Unless we mack that shit up, nigga you get lit

Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas
Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(I can't take the heat)
It's wicked in these streets (It's wicked in the street)
Slow down, (I can't take the heat no more) cause I can't take the heat
Slow down (I can't take it) it's wicked in these streets
Slow down (slow down) cause I can't take the heat
(Slow down) Slow down
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas
Slow down slow down
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas

// Woof! //

Throwin' bad days behind us
Ahh damn up in the headlights

Find your ass in there tip-toeing
Your ass is mine

I come faster than a speedin' bullet
Or I can take my time and move it slow
Wake up outta my seat and hit this mic and blow like some indo
You can call me what you want
Just don't call me no punk
My name is Snoop D-O-double-G
And I'm the godfather of G-Funk
I'll put this shit down, like clown, Dogg Pound is my set
Nigga set outta line, I shoot them in they mothafuckin' spine
And break they necks (nigga, nigga)
As I go down, you gon' realize that
See when you run up in my face you able to get smacked, jacked, just
like that
I'ma fool, break the rules, damn, way too cool
They call me Snoop D-O-double-G (na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)

Cause I'ma fuckin' fool, I can get silly
But I'd rather sit back, relax, new jacks, get smacked, cause I'm tryin'

To my nigga Mystikal, Fiend, and my big homie Master P
Cause thats just the way this shit gon' be

// Gin & Juice #2 //

Ahh-haaa
Get your motherfuckin' glass, cus it's a blast from the past
You didn't think would touch it two times nigga
Gin and Juice up in this bitch, yahhh
Some of that Beats By the Pound flavor, you feel me (you heard me)
Get your ice, get your cups, Cus we about to get fucked up in here
Yah (yah), Straight up, Uhmm (uhmm), Yah (yah)

I'm still smokin', driftin', swifta than a mothafucka
Twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice
Heated in the seat cup fulla drank
Beatin' up the block in the dark blue tank
Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause
Diggin' in my draws for dem muthafuckin' laws
Harrassin' a nigga, blastin' a nigga
I ain't seen shit, so why you askin' nigga
To fucked up off that G-I and juice,
C-I get loose, nigga what chall wanna do
I got a crew, but I choose to roll solo
Especially on Sundays dippin' in my low-low
Convertable top, spot for the glock, I ain't fuckin' with the hen dogg
So toss out the soda pop.
Put my shit on three wheels for thrills
I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real

[Chorus]
Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin', ???, Sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies [2X]

Now trip dis', I'm on Interstate 10 fuckin' with this Creole
She said she knows NINO, now stop me loc
Cup of that Gin and Juice, I blank a bitch out
Then turn the bitch out, look here
There ain't no need for you to be wastin' my time
See I picked you up, now I'm gunna stick you up, And dick you up!
Give you what you need, then bring you back down to reality
With that California weed, she seemed trouble at first
And then it got worse, cus now I got my hand up and down her mini-skirt
Twerkin' that shit while riddin' up the highway
Doin' it my way, hella highway, the fly way
Swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain
And baby girl steady takin' dick to the brain
Now it ain't no thing, cus she swallowed it up
Then she wanted to take a puff, I said "Look here bitch you've had
enough"

[Chorus x2]

Somebody say, I wanna get fucked up
(Say What, Say What)
Come on, Now
Everybody say, I wanna get fucked up
(What Chew Say, What Chew Say) YAH

I'm hopped by the ice cream shop, The cops saw me, stopped me, heard me
Were's Serv-D, well serve me, since you got that big bad ass dangle
Nigga you know I'm know for havin' that big ass bank
Tryin' to find all your dope, cus your a smoker
I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast
Cus times gettin' hard on the boulevard, but I refuse to loose ?!?!?!
Lil' Jimmy's sent me something, I need to cop something
Got Some (Got Some), I know you got some
Nigga stop frontin', get at your boy
Hook it up like Master P (Ughh)
Would it be a tragedy to fill me the best weed

[Chorus x2]

// Hustle & Ball //

Never bite the hand that feeds you
Cause you never know when your dog might need you

[Chorus x4]

[Snoop Dogg]
Went from halves to wholes, from wood to marble floors

// 20 Dollars To My Name //

Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit
Check this out

[Snoop Dogg]
Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm  tyring to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up till they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time i love to smoke
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name

[Chorus  Fiend]
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed  repeat

[Fiend]
I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for ??? this
Soda couldn't rock this
chop a shelf when i drop this
My ??? can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before

[Soulja Slim]
Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being 
shot

[Chorus]

[Silkk the Shocker]
Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels goo to be on the outside
I had 120 dollars, but i spent a 100 on my ride
Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name
Nigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine
I told him weed charge it 2 the game
Nigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit
Some slum shit
Some out the projects dumb shit
some weed and blunt shit
Some I don't give a fuck shit, where it from shit
Some penitentiary solitary confinement never see no motherfuckin' sun 
shit
Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more
So I tell nigga hit the floor I'm about to pull a motherfuckin' kick 
door
Now whether it's rapping, or jacking, kidnapping, or gun totting
Y'all call me down??? do get scared I ain't flipped till my guns smoking
It be a hustle just to eat  
And it be hard on these streets
Gotta get my hustle on
Got 20 dollars y'all now that shit don't last long  picture this

// DP Gangsta //

[Eddie Talking] 
This is a service public announcement going out to all the paper haters

Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here

[Snoop]
Here's a little something about a nigga like me
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my AK 
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out
Now I'm that motherfucker y'all read about
Smoking you and your crew, taking a life or two
You dont like how I'm living well fuck you
This is my gang nigga No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute

Everywhere we go they say "DAMN"
Them gangstas they be fucking up the program
And then you realize we dont care

Niggas living rowdy and stay bout it bout it
Gangsta Gangsta Thats what the selling
Bitches want to buy it cause they love that straight G shit

[Snoop]
Homies all standing around just hanging
Some dope dealing some gang banging
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know
I had my double pointing at his window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to ????
Sweating all the bitches in the dazzy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing 
So we all said "FUCK YOU BITCH" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into 
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga cold nutting it off
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs
I might stumble and still wont lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blue's
Cause I'm the type of nigga who's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See I dont give a fuck cause I keep bailing
Yo what the fuck are they yelling

He represents the tank but yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit

[C-Murder]
Well I'm C-Murder the one he talking about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me you know they some haters

And I'll smoke a motherfucker like it aint no thing
To all my bitches, I know your jocking my crew

[Girls]

Yo what the fuck are they yelling

[Chorus x1]

[Eddie Talking]
If you'd of just stay down and been a motherfuckers real partner you 
wouldn't have had tat problem
But seeing as you want to jump ship and you thought the ship would sink 
a motherfucker without turning into a submarine, went under water came 
back up with a periscope looking at your bitch ass

A bunch of used to be paranoid drug dealers
A bout 'it motherfucker standing on the block
Ain't no limit to his heart, cause his veins is non-stop
And constantly a nigga catching them cases
With them death situations
A nigga blast with no hesitation
Mama I wanna now where my daddy at
My only memory is a picture with a chrome gat
I wanna do, like them gangsters do
I wanna gangster walk
I caught a bullet now I'm in some chalk
Just another young nigga in a song
Mama always told me gangster's don't live long
After I'm dead can you still see me
Do you really want to be me
I'm just another bossaline
I represent all them niggas trying to get paid
But couldn't be saved
Huh, y'all now what I'm talking about

From the little shit I remember you was a down ass nigga
I'm mad i missed shit you could have showed me  (fuck)
Shit still ain't the same even though my mama told me
I keep your memories in my endeavors    (nigga)
Thank you for being my daddy, thank you for what you left us
I swear to protect, and the only way to carry on, is carry on
My nigga little Mike, my nigga G-Slim, and my cousin Larry gone
I ain't trying to question God, but why so young
That's why from daylight to night time I got my gun
This fucking thing we call life ain't nothing but a phase
That's why you better keep your faith,or you're that thug in the grave

[Chorus: repeat 4X]

[Snoop Dogg]
Rest in peace khaki's creased
From the east side of Long Beach
Pouring out liquor, thinking about my homie
Cause I can't understand how it went down
We used to clown from town to town
Claiming dogg pound
Took you on lollapalooza with a nigga
L0Dog you my nigga
If you don't get no bigger
Spanky Loco from the the dub, and Little Man from the I
Dear God why them good niggas have to die
I can't reminisce too long
Cause I'm in a war zone
If I sleep, slip, trip I might get blasted on
So I'm gone mash on home
but on the way I see some of my enemies
And they tripping on me
Cause I fuck with Master P
But I;m heated, so beat it
And another 87 case, I really don't need it
Proceeded, I ain't gone cry for the homie
Shit we gone celebrate
Cause we now the homeboy is in a safer and better place

[Chorus: repeat 3X]

// Payin' For Pussy //

The stock market has always been 100% when it comes to pussy
The worlds oldest profession
Yah it's still alive
No matter what the consequences
A trick 'gun still buy it
No matter how sick they make it
A hard stick gunna still wanna play it
Marching up, every day and every night
To the drummers beat
Titled the oldest profession, and it never fell back
Not even in the recession
No Christmas toys for the kids
Yah daddy fucked it up
He said he was drunk playing poker with the boys
Yah niggas pay for pussy
Remember that Easter Sunday
It was so damn sunny
We didn't get no Easter clothes, candy, or Easter bunny
Yah, daddy fucked it up
Rollin' dice with the boys
Yah niggas pay for pussy
Whether it's at the tity bar
Or outta the car
Yah niggas pay for pussy

OHH yah, Some niggas pay for pussy, oh yah
Some niggas pay for pussy, oh yah
Some niggas pay for pussy, oh yah
Dem niggas pay for pussy, oh yah
Niggas pay for pussy, oh yah

// Doggz Gonna Get Ya //

[Snoop]
I'm in Junior High with a C+ grade
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade
I to school from my moms apartment
I got to tell these niggas everyday don't shit
Cause where I'm at if you soft you lost
And to stay on course, you got to roll with force
My homeboy Dogg is chilling in a Benz
In front of his building witht the rest of his friends
I give him a pound no I mean I shake his hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man
I go upstairs, I hug my mother
I kiss my sister and I punch my brother
I sit down on the bed to watch some t.v.
[Gun Shots] Do my ears decieve me
No That's the fourth time this week
Four young brothers got shot in the street
The very next day while I'm off to class
My momma go to work cold bustin' her ass
My sisters cute but shes got no gear 
I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share
So there in school I made a fool
With one and a half pair of pants, you aint cool
Cause there's no dollars for nothing else
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
Now everyday I see my momma struggling
So now its time I got to do something
I look for work
I get dissed like a jerk
I do odd jobs 
And come home like a slob
So here comes Dogg his gold is shivery
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once I do it twice
And now there's stake with the beans and rice
My mothers nervous but she knows the deal
My sisters gear now has sex appeal
My brothers my partner and were getting paper
And three months later the whole hood cought the vapors
My family's happy and everything is new
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

[Chours]
Doggz Gonna Get Ya [x4]

[Mac Talking]
Ay yo yo Check this out Snoop
All these niggas always talking about
"They looove this" And niggas got looove for you
Or nigga I looove this ride or this chin around my neck nigga
You niggas dont know what the fuck love really mean
Nigga you cant buy love at no corner store nigga
Love aint got no price tag
Snoop I want you to kick this shit to them niggas

[Snoop]
hmm
Money is flowing everything is fine
I bought my self and Uzi and my brother a nine
Business is booming everyhing is cool
I pull about a G a week, fuck school
A year passed by and I began to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I kick up my feet to watch some t.v.
Cause now I got other people working for me
I got a 55" television you know
And every once in a while I hear "Just say no"
Or the other commercial I love
That's when they say this is you brain on drugs
I pick up the remote control and just turn
Cause with this bullshit I'm not concerned
Me and my brother bounced in the Benz
We driving around our territory again
I pull up at the light like a superstar
An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car
I hit the accellerater scared as shit
I drove one block to find my brother was hit
He wasnt dead but the blood was pouring
And all I could think about was Warren
Later I found it was Dogg and his crew
Now tell mw what the fuck am I suppose to do

[Chours x8]

[Mac Talking]
Yeah so now you see what I'm talkin bout nigga
You see what that love shit do ya
This nigga said he had love nigga and this nigga done shot yo brother
So what the fuck you gone do now

[Snoop]
My brother s out of it but I'm still in it
On top of that I'm in it to win it
I cant believe that Dogg would dis me
That faggot that punk he soft or sissy
I driving around with three of my guys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We rolled right up to Dogg's favorite hang out
What's cracking Dogg and let the bullets stang out
Someone shot back so we took cover
And all i could about was my brother
Dogg jumped up and began to run
Bustin shots hopping to hit someone
So I just stopped and let off three shot
Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
I threw down the gun and began to shout
"Ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out
Now as I left there goes the boys in blue
They pointin they guns at my four man crew 
They shot down one, they shot down two
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

[Chours x8]

[Snoop Talking]
Ya see the moral of the story is this
Love is a motherfucka
And Doggs is a motherfucka
You mix the two up you bound to get some drama
Loves gonna get ya
Naw nigga Doggz gonna get ya you ever try to play me and thats real
Thats real

// Hoes, Money, And Clout //

Dogg Pound
Don Colion, whatever, whatever, Dogg Pound, East Side
Don Colion, whatever, whatever, Dogg Pound, East Side
Don Colion, whatever, whatever, Dogg Pound, East Side

For all my homies with the eight tray wigs (ride on)
And all the playas in the '79 Coupes (ride on)
For all of my gang affiliates in tha hoppin' '68
This ones from me to you (ride on) 
Well, not the Under Dogg, call me the Wonder Dogg
I keep it crackin' while I'm stackin' in this game called rappin'
Now I kick up my feet like I kick a rhyme to a beat
And everytime you see me on the streets ,I gots some heat
Hell, yeah, then pass the beat
And everybody wanna know what's up with me and Master P (ughh)
For your concern, you knew there wann't no gimmick
When I got into some gangsta shit and told you wann't No Limit
To the thangs I'm gon' do
Now it's really goin' down with the DPGC
Well, Daz did the beat, and Kurupt got the heat
And Tray Dee, he laid the hook and Supafly played the keys (woo, woo)
Ughh, it get no realer than this from the LB to the Down South
Add more killers to this entourage
South, West, oh, yes
We in charge and we'll pull your cards
No disrespect or disregards
Life in the big LB is gettin' hard (so what)
So my squad gon' mob and drop bombs
Bring me along, we causin' everybody harm

[Chorus 2x:]
I make ya scream (ahhhhhh)
I make ya shout (ooooohhh)
C'mon all you partyin' people
Let me turn ya out
Cuz you know I'm all about
The hoes, money, and clout
And I rock a Long Beach City (heyyyyyy)
All the way down South

Can you feel me?
I can dig it
Hoes- Take me to the bridge

Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (who)
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (what)
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (who)
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg

Whether in a Khaki suit or a pimped stripe
I'm a G for G and nuttin' else for life
You can bet your bottom biscuit
You get twisted if you dwellin' in my felon intuition (what up)
Tha Doggfather is a household name
>From basketball to alcohol, everybody love the Dogg
I'm sure Billy King probably got a Doggystyle tape
Somewhere hidden in his briefcase
Newsweek, Rolling Stone, major magazines
Dope fiends, prom queens, we too clean
Take a look you ain't ever seen
One hip-hop rapstar drop this West Coast rap-cord
Back to the spot up top
West Hills for real, give it up to him (WC)
A who bang with diamond
Take a hit with big Lajeezy before he found some wheezy
With blue Colion playin' in the backround
On the behind line with big style
Hitting P, LIG tell him let it go
Game strong, no longer in the roll
Just a few names from the respected files
LBC styles, DPG ale 
I bought a house with a lake in the back
My big holey stack just like that

[Chorus:]

// Get Bout It & Rowdy //

[MP (back round):]
(LBC, New orleans ha ha) Yo dog, uh

[Snoop:]
Sup P?

[MP:]
(Ha ha) That's some real shit where the hot boys at,
Where the hot girls at [x6]
Ya heard me? [x2]
The game is to be sold not to be told, ha ha
Now this No Limit shit, No Limit nigga
Everbody wanna know how this shit happens, but we ain't playa hatin
And what's goin on, but ya know what?
It don't  get no realer than this though dog

[CHORUS(x2)]
West-side niggas gettin bout it, UNGH! 
I said East-side niggas gettin rowdy, UNGH!
Mid-west niggas gettin bout it, UNGH!
South-side niggas gettin rowdy, UNGH! (yea)

[Snoop:]
Fuck that man,da game is to be sold, not to be told, 1st things 1st
I'm a gangsta, nigga, so I'ma roll
Ya got to get bout it or without it
I had to shake the spot cause the game got crowded
I'm devoted and quote it, I'm rowdy and bout it
A No Limit Soldier, and happy to shout it
Got this tank on my neck, got my tech. on deck
I slap raps at your caps and try to make my snaps
Nick-Nack patty-wack big happy sack, the dealer is back
And I'm ridin' through your neighborhood dippin' in my Cadillac
I'm sellin this shit, I ain't tellin this shit
I'm a mutha fuckin 2-time felon ya bitch
From the cold hearted streets of the LBC 
To a mansion in the south down the street from my nigga P
See, real niggas recognize the realness
Put ya mutha fuckin choppers up if ya feel this
(Bust one) Now bust one(gun shot) Not just one [2 gun shots]
And if ya want some get some, I bet we got some
Bustas discuss us, niggas poppin all the Ying-Yang
Still the Dogg Pound Gang (DPG, Man) 
Beats still funky, Beats by the Pound in the house,
At the mutha fuckin door

[CHORUS(x2)]

[Snoop:]
(Gettin rowwwdy) Everybody in the game, say the same
Is Snoop's still that gang bang cocaine nigga slangin everythang
I'm tryin to get as much as I need
While I fuck with these out of town hoes blowin all they weed (shut up)
Parlayin, so whatcha sayin
Bring a couple buddies witcha, girl we ain't playin
Baby must miss read me, cause she miss lead me
Has some niggas come by later (what?) and try to spray me (bitch)
But I'm just to quick, slick and sly
When it's time to ride I let the bullets fly cause it's do or die(die die...)
I wear blue 7 days out the week (for life)
I mob the street, DP, while I'm holdin my heat
I wanna warn you, shit they got killers on the East, Mid-West, up North, down
South in California
So if you got your chrome, you need to stay in the zone
And get a vest for your mutha fuckin dome
Cause it's on like a dog with out his bone
I'm in it to win it and No Limit is my home (for life for life)
Nigga, real niggas recognize the realness
Put ya mutha fuckin choppers up if ya feel this
(Bust one) Now bust one(gun shot) Not just one [2 gun shots]
And if ya want some get some,(what up what up) I bet we got some (got some)

[CHORUS(x4)]

[MP:]
Nigga, bout it bout it ha ha
Snoop Dogg, Master P, and the whole No Limit mutha fuckin family nigga
From the South to the West to the East to the middle
To the mutha fuckin WORLD!
Ha ha real niggas and bitches unite
