Album: EgoTrippin

// Cool //

I got a penthouse in Manhattan 
Two more in Malibu 
I bought an 87 Cadillac Seville 
I got a Maserati too
I wear diamonds on my fingers 
A couple on my toes,
I wear the finest cologne money can buy
It keeps me smellin' like a rose
If u wonderin' how I do it
There's just one simple rule...I'm just cool (cool)
Honey baby cant you see...I'm just cool (cool) 
Aint nobody bad like me

I might dine in San Francisco
Dance all night in Rome
I go any freakin' place I want to
And my lear jet brings me home
I got ladies by the dozen
I got money by the ton
Just aint nobody better 
Heaven knows that I'm the one
Its all because of something
That I didn't learn in school,
Im just cool (cool)
Honey baby cant you see...I'm soo cool (cool) 
Aint nobody bad like me

Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh

[Snoop Dogg]
Now stop, pause, chill for a second
It's Snoop Dogg and Teddy Riley on the record
Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell all your friends
They got a party that's crackin' and that shit won't end
Me and my folks, we drink and we smoke, we rockin' the boat
We pop about four, five more, so
Bend don't break, break don't bend
I'm number one with a bullet, I'ma make more ends
When you're great they gonna hate
So what, that's probably why we Cali-fornicate
And shake to a whole nother elevation
Catch me in the hood or your favorite television station
Creatin', a whole nother lane for the generation
I drink Sunkist for the good vibration
Dippin', Rippin', shakin' and bakin'
I know you've been patiently waitin', I'm back y'all

[Chorus]
Snoop Dogg is out
You wanna be there partyin'
All night long
Until the break of dawn
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh

[Snoop Dogg]
On your mark, set, party on 3
4, hit the floor and go for what ya know (hey!)
I'm in the party low-key, blowin' an eighth of dro
I'm playful but I don't play
Spinnin' the globe like the strobe
Like the club packed, my flow right the whole night
If I plan to go right, a cold night
in hell before I fail, I'm alright
Man, I'm like a flash of lightnin'
Breath of fresh air, classic debonair
Glass of champagne, hold it in my right hand
Finger roll cold, Dogg the Ice Man
Brazil to Iceland
I shine like a million lights man
The talk of the town, believe it or doubt it
I don't need to shout it, you better read about it

[Chorus]
Snoop Dogg is out
You wanna be there partyin'
All night long
Until the break of dawn
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh

[Snoop Dogg]
Now pose like a superstar, walk like a model
I love it when you pop that bottle
I love it 'cause you're not so automatic
I love it when you put it where Dogg can grab it
I got my hands where you'll let me
I love it when you dance, so sexy
I love it when you in that night mood
Slow motion movin' like ain't nothin' like you
I'm feelin' good doin' what I like to
Suited up, pimp stripe, light blue
I let it do what it might do
Fresh and crispy, the rest a mystery
I'm blessed with history
No less than best, catch the rest
Live in the flesh, smooth with the style I choose
Not off the stress, I'm hot off the press

[Chorus]
Snoop Dogg is out
You wanna be there partyin'
All night long
Until the break of dawn
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh

// Neva Have 2 Worry //

[Snoop Dogg]
1992, "Deep Cover" hit the world and fell in love with Snoop
"Doggystyle" came out, it's like I dropped a bomb
One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time
I was young gettin' money, livin' wild and free
Got on and I brought the whole Pound with me
Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way too G
Niggaz knew it was Eastside L.B.C.
Gangsta shit, that's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get
The one up above didn't like my pace
I was movin' too fast and I caught that case
I fought that case, wonder where the West would be if I'da lost that case
I slow mine down, swimmin' with the sharks and I almost drowned

[Chorus]
I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm finally out
And the critics hated on me 'cause I went to the South
Said I wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead
Switched sides, now my old boss want me dead
Dropped the first of the three and you said it was weak
"No Limit Top Dogg", the return of the beast
So from that point on I know what to do
Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do
"Last Meal" was the one that took me off the leash
That's the last time a nigga gon' eat off of me
Stack plaque after plaque, gain millions sold
I'm the Bo$$ of this bitch and I ain't never went Gold, nigga

[Chorus]
I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

[Snoop Dogg]
Bo$$ of the City, Bo$$ of the Coast
Some other niggaz tried but none of 'em come close
They stuck lookin' silly, but nothin' like a loc
The Bigg Bow Wow, I kill it with one stroke
(Wow!) That's what it's about
They tryin' to tell a nigga what could come out his mouth
Motherfucker I'm a G, but first I'm a man
Freedom of Speech, bitch is a word you can't ban
So they blamin' me, sayin' this my talk
to some women as hoes, like it's my fault
Damn they lost, man they just don't know
That a bitch is a bitch, and a hoe is a hoe
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'm gon' be smokin' dank, livin' like a boss
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'ma be smokin' my dank, livin' like a boss, nigga

[Chorus]
I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

// Sexual Eruption //

[HOOK:]
I'm gonna take my time
She gonna get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gonna rush the stroke

[CHORUS:]
So she can get a

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
I was all on the
Club, sippin' some Hen, smokin' on a blunt of dro
When I peeped this little hoe out
I was all on the
Bar, wind drift up
Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor now
With a see-through
Dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Ms. Bo Peep
And a nigga know
If I take her home, with them wide ass hips
You damn right, I'm gonna beep
So I a-
Proached the chick with the real pretty face
Big ass booty with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?"
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gonna say shit
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some fuck faces
But it wasn't no use for me to bust one
Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

[CHORUS WITH AD-LIBBING]
Sexual eruption (A sexual eruption)
Sexual eruption
Orgasms
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption
Whoa
Whoa
Sexual eruption
All the time, anytime
Sexual eruption

Headed to the club in my brand new scaper
Gators on my feet, money in my pocket
I gotta do a show so you know I'm bout to rock it
See my homie $hort, layin' low-key
I strolled over to him, and passed him the bleezy
Dogg y Dog, anything goes
Snappin' my fingers, crackin' at some hoes
What do ya know, I'm in The A gettin' play all day
A lot of y'all wanna ball and try to walk this way
Y'all want that shine-shine but that's all mine
I'm bonafied, qualified to have a hot damn time
Now listen, get the picture, and take a picture of me quick
See 'cause tomorrow I got a new city that I'm gon' hit

I hope you feel the same way about yourself, beotch!

// Waste Of Time //

[Snoop Dogg]
Yo, this next record right here, is a dedication
This dedicated to those, who've come to an end
Quit like Gladys Knight... 
You know neither one of us wants
to be the first one to say goodbye
So, hopefully this record will help you
Get to the conclusion, ya dig?

I love this girl but I don't know about her
.As a matter of fact, I could go without her
But she got my daughter, I don't know why I bother
to try to make it work when she make it so harder
Wake up and break up and do the same thing tomorrow
I get tired of fightin', I feel no sorrow
for you, to keep it movin' in that Monte Carlo
That's what I get for fuckin' with a video model

[Raphael Saadiq]
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

[Snoop Dogg]
You don't love me, you just love my Doggystyle
I used to put it on yo' ass, you ain't had it in a while
Instead of crackin' smiles, you'd rather cramp a nigga style
You act too wild, I won't walk you down the aisle
What you thought? Yeah, we could chill, we could talk
When I look you in your eyes I no longer see sparks
So it's, best we go our seperate ways and stay apart
No more me and you boo, I done had a change of heart

[Raphael Saadiq]
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you
But I'm not in love with you
(I'm just not in love with you baby)
I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you
But I'm not in love with you
And feels like such a... 

Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Sorry it had to end this way
But uh, it is what it is
I'm alright, don't worry about me
I'm cool, ha ha, yeah
You go your way and I'll go mine
Real talk, I'm cool, I ain't even trippin'
I'ma roll out with Raphael
Yeah, fo sho, I'ma roll with him
I'm cool, you go your way, I go mine
I guess I'll see ya next lifetime
See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya

That's not the Bigg Bo$$ Dogg
I've been in it since a youngin', I'm a Eastside hogg
21st Street ridin', Rollin' with my partners
Hat to the back in a rag spillin' vodka
Stompin' through the city in my big blue Chuck's
Lil' homies on the corner not givin' a fuck
So I chunked up the set like what's happenin' with you
Shit I just do what I do, I'm just stackin' it too
Is what he said to a loc as I dipped on out
Or as we say on the Eastside, you Cripped on out
See the sunshine and palm trees, livin' it up
Don't forget the block boys givin' it up
Where you from loc?

[Chorus: Pharrell]
(Sets Up!) Chest out
In and out, in and out
Lift your arm, lift your arm

Show me where you're from
Show me where you're from

[Snoop Dogg]
For the rules of the game, represent your shit
Flag around the steering collar makin 'em sick
Shoot, the L.B. made me, gangbang for real
If ya made it through the '80s I'm a product of the shady
Snoop D-O-doub', it's what I does
I'm worldwide love, the homies is like cuz
Stuck to the script and kept claimin' the team
They love it when I chunk it on the TV screen
Like a, Bo$$ would do, how the fuck could you

All around the world they respectin' a G
Overseas they respectin' the C, that's on me

Uh, if you ain't did it you ain't did a thang
Uh, you come through you better holler at me
You need beats you better holler at P

// Deez Hollywood Nights //

[Chorus]
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy

[Snoop Dogg]
Huh, it's like that that there
They love it when I let down my hair
from Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson
even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel
So I let 'em all come to my back table
Roll up and lick the paper if they able
Bottles of everything, models and everything
Everything goes and yes I mean everything
Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'
So, I invite her over to my party
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie
No autographs, I ain't signin' now
Act like you been around a boss, bitch settle down
My life is like one big highlight
Welcome to the motherfuckin' Hollywood night life

[Chorus]
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy

[Snoop Dogg]
Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion
With some whites, some asians and persians
They flirtin', and I'm certain they suckin'
One night with the Dogg and it's curtains
She say she wanna be an actress
So I pointed to these nuts and then I yelled ACTION!
Take one, take two, now cut
Now turn around, and let the homie Damani fuck
Huh, yeah, here we go again
I gotta go behind the club just to get in
They say I'm just too much commotion
All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes I got 'em open
I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub
Smokin' with one of the Marley's, "One Love"
I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass
Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class, c'mon

[Chorus]
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy

[Snoop Dogg]
Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room
I'm on Sunset (where you at?) at The House of Blues
I just stepped in for a quick cameo
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio
He keep a bad hoe, I keep a bad hoe
He slide me new hoes everywhere we go
Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight
Yes, these Hollywood nights
Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out
Cameras flashin', police passin'
Every little model wanna give me some action
So I let 'em kick it, then I let 'em lick it
Get some m_nage, durin' every visit
I wouldn't leave it, even if they paid me
The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy

[Chorus]
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy

// Whateva U Do //

Funny thing about it is that I'm fuck your bitch
Ok yo, hoe lay low, get mayo, like OJ yo, say hoe
Plug it in, pull it out, put it in, wat it is, that's wat it's all about
Now wat would I be if I let a punk motherfucker run up on me
I play chess checkmate him in the street, 32 fever off blast that's three
Swish swish fresh fish ain't that a bitch, like ray-jay I gotta run which
Look at the place I'm in, I never fuck superhead acam crawdashier
It's a discrace to yourself, dogg is the champ to the face with the belt
I'm undefeated, undisputed, persicuted, spaded and neutered; faded and booted

[Chorus:]
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you
We got that chronic chronic, we got that wateva u do

Put ya hands in the sky, stick up, pick up piece of american pie
Wat kind of car do ya drive?
Suicide doors on the passenger side?
Do the windows roll down? do the doors lift high?
Do the car change colour when that bitch drive by?
I don't really know an I don't really care
Cause me and my money's like sonny and cher
Spend dow at the goochy store
I never spend dow on the coochy though

You can check it, I got a record in brazil
For runnin out and not payin the bitches
Juvinial delinquint, see when I speak dis
Move when I bleep dis
Lil nigga peep dis
Ya secrets is all exposed

If ya grew up on ma music
Ya mumma's one of ma hoes
Ya daddy's one of ma foe's
Ya granny's been to one of ma shows

It is contrary that my literachary
Is very nesesary, ya feel me?
An you can try to rewind it, define it
Deside it to a whole notha groove
Play it to anotha move
Hope ya go through
Cause ya won't strike two
With twelve jury's up your piers
You better hope they like you
Ain't no tellin wat they might do
So I'm gonna just stay out their mothafucka way view
Dippin in an outta town

Even got a homie named prince akeem

But I don't give a damn, a boss's life is how I make that bread,
Toss the mic and I'll still be richer than rich and have you bitch make my bed,
My pockets fat as shit, you niggas mad as shit,
Fuck neither Warner bro's, I'm on some Gladys shit,
Many have tried and failed, shit I'm out on bail,

Shit I went to jail, you can go to hell,
You got some shit to tell, I got some shit to sell.

[Chorus:]
I got staxxx in my jeans Phantom up in my garage,

Candy paint dripping, look at all them bags,
I had to show and brag, 'cause being broke's a drag,
I gotta get this paper, my kids they gotta eat!
We got a lot of heat, just case them dollars, cease,
Been out for balling, shot calling and I make that change,
And I don't want the Range, chop that spray on things,
That's how gangsters do it, we get our green and bricks,
We put our green in blunts, you spend your green on chicks,
I'm on some player shit, dynasty straight Lakers shit,
Cook it up on some baker shit, and chop it up on some paper bitch!
I got my mind right, and my money right,
If you ain't in the game for the money, you the funny type,
And I'm laughing my ass off, Phantom with the mask off,

You know how Snoopy does it, Phantom, don't bitch touch it,
One hundred thousand a show, I'm getting dough like fuck!

[Chorus]

Look how that flag hanging, gangbanging I ain't no punk,
Maintain till that thing came out the truck, make that (A)K go pop pop pop!
I'm about my bidness boy, making money never been so smooth,
You bitch you're about to lose, 'cause she's about to choose!
And that's the way it goes, S N double O,
You want that quiet type, I want that trouble ho!
Now go get paper girl, yeah, I meant for real,
One time I told a bitch not to come back till she got two thousand dollars in two dollar bills! (Wow!)
That's cold game, a ho thing,

You know how daddy do it, I'm true to it,

She all about this pimping, I'm all about this cash,

[Chorus]

// Been Around Tha World //

Yeah, this record's for my baby, my baby boo
I know I'm always on the road, I'm always gone
And you say I'll never make records for you no more
Well this record is from me to you baby
Yeah, real talk

Been around tha world
I've been into many places seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

I seen everything twice
Been around tha world, I've seen every scene twice
Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice

I do it big, fuck the rumors
Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Pumas
Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami
I did all that, I was voted ...

I'm sorta like Sammy
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy
Sipping Chardinae, making deals on my hands free
Fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me
'Cause I own rap and I'm coming for your day job

Until then I'm chilling at the day spa
Relax my mind and just chill
'Cause without you none of this is real
Baby you know I

Been around tha world
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

Yeah, but now I'm back across the water
I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter
Blowing sticky by the zips and they can tell
By my rag hanging, fuck this is Crip, but I'm chilling

It feels so good to get away
Especially when your name is D O double Gizzee
Coast to coast jetting, man I been doing that
What's up, just start balling ... I been around the track

Hop in Peas with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office
Docking down in Monaco, churching with my folks
Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat

My life is like a movie
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
Then I relax and chill
'Cause without you none of this is real
Baby you know I

Been around tha world
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

Been around tha world
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

Just for you baby
Yeah, I'm on my way home right now
I'm on my way right now
I'm leaving the studio right now

Yeah, soon as I get home tomorrow I'ma go unplug it
Matter of fact I ain't even gonna bring it in the house
See you in a minute

// Let It Out //

[Snoop Dogg]
Well it's the super duper Snoopa once again I'm on the fly
Swoopin through I'm in my coupe and all the bitches want a ride
If it's trippin like I'm clippin I'm still grippin on my nine
We be Crip'n while I'm dippin with my C's up in the sky
And the East is still my side, I'm a reaper when I ride
Fuck a feature, I don't need a motherfucker, I'm the guy
I delete 'em, stampede 'em, straight eat 'em like some fries
Get a ketchup, get 'em messed up, turn the heat up let 'em fry
Ain't no different when I'm rippin, pimpin's still up in his prime
TV shows, movie hoes, pimpin's still up on his grind
Man these hoes don't know, I'm workin with a nine
I ain't talkin 'bout a gun, I'm talkin feel it in your spine
when I hit it from behind, if I go up in your mouth
I might hit you in the mind, you know what I'm talkin 'bout
It'll thrill ya, I'm the stealer that'll kill ya with the rhythm of a trigger
Motherfucker better duck before I hit her, bang!

[Chorus]
Dogg-y Dogg, is all, you need
So love, the Dogg, like we, love weed

(Breathe in) Breathe in (breathe out) let it out

[Snoop Dogg]
You niggaz mad cause I done came and crept up back up on the scene

Little nigga I'm the king, I ain't givin up a thing

Make a patient nigga got the other ear and I'll bake a nigga
Fuck it put the gun down, and straight bank a nigga
Take it nigga, take it nigga fuck, you ain't this nigga

Tryin to search my house, what the fuck that's 'bout?

[Chorus - 2X]

// My Medicine //

I got my nephew Whitey Ford on the guitar
Young Trev' on the drums
Grand Ole Opry, here we come, uhh

Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

Yeah, you know I got to have that medicine
That prescription medicine baby
Y'know, purple, orange, green

[Snoop Dogg]
Jack starts hangin 'round with some fiends
Got strung out, sold the cow for beans
Told young wifey, "I love ya honey
But you gotta hit the streets, go and get my money"
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

Yeah, the mo' dedicated the mo' medicated
Can you feel me?

[Snoop - singing]
Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
(And I'm high all day, every day)
You can trust every word I'm gonna say will be a lie

[Snoop Dogg]
Haha, yeah I lie sometimes
What's the use of the truth if you can't get a lie sometimes baby?
Now dig this

Jack starts a track up and down the hill
Got to walkin thinkin ace what he told to Jill
Come rain, come shine, come snow or if it's sunny
Get the fuck out, come and get my money
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

Yeah
They say you can't buy me love, but you damn sure can buy me bud

[Snoop - singing]
Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
(Oh I'm so high right now, how 'bout you?)
You can trust every word I'm gonna tell you is a lie
(Liar liar, haha, pants on fire)
Girl I love you (I love you though)
Yeahhhh!

// Ridin' In My Chevy //

[Chorus:]
Ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin at the light (at the light)
I got kush in my blood, sippin' Remy keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the cut,
And all the people when they see me like "Snoop turn it up!"

When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin at the light (at the light)
I got kush in my blood, sippin' Remy keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the cut,
And all the people when they see me like "Snoop turn it up!"

Im in my zone MO'FUCKER, get stuck in the ribs by a old BONE CRUSHER,
Two tone leather with the soul of a HUSTLER,
Tryin' to stack mayos steal the clothes from my BROTHER, 
People wanna know am I close to my MOTHER,
Im a premature baby I'm ahead of the OTHERS.
Yes I'm aware of the GUTTER, ahead of my time, the games gettin' SMOTHERED
I stay on the grind but its only gettin ROUGHER
Niggas think I'm playin 'till they smokin' like a MUFFLER,
'bout to take like a lane open on you BUSTA'S.
Catch me if you can, in a world full of SUCKA'S
Niggas keep synthin', they wanna be USHER,
Until they get their eyes and coffin closed by the USHER,
Their punches wont work, you need more MUSTARD,
Lord lay 'em down, he need no sufferin', nigga!

[Chorus]

Hmm, on my road to RICHES, I done seen a lotta roaches 'n' BITCHES
Thats why the dogg keep low in the DISTANCE,
But niggas don't know when to LISTEN, thats why I load AMMUNITION,
And stay in touch with my COMPETITION, I'm in touch with my COMPOSITION,
Roll a blunt, it's the coosh, yea we got PRESCRIPTIONS, just to defy,
No ENCRIPTIONS, pick a side, yea you know we CRIPPIN',
And through my eyes I see the world DIFFERENT, a hundred g's to record WITH 'EM,
Hit the gas, give me more ENGINE, this is somethin' that was born IN 'EM,
No game for a bitch just for a FIDDLE, I'm in tune give me more RHYTHM,
I let the bullets and the swords HIT 'EM, all p's like a Porsche EMBLEM,
Now make dead with the MORTICIAN, nigga, this big Snoop Dogg you best to listen,
You heard me?

[Chorus]

// Those Gurlz //

[Chorus]
(Those girls, those girls)
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me
I was just playin' the game
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)

[Snoop Dogg]
I got a call from this hoe the other day
She say she just moved down from The Bay
to L.A. - well that's great
We should sit down and talk face to face
You bring the barbeque, I got the paper plates
I can't lie girl, I like the way you shake
And when you dance the way you make your booty shake
Give or take, I rate you 'bout an eight
Or a nine - okay, fine, you a dime
And them other bitches they gon' wait in line
They hatin' on you how you take away they shine
Rewind, pay attention to the signs
I see money when I look you in the eyes
No lie, I love how you stay fly
So fly, send a text and I'll reply
And when you need that good sex, I'm the guy

[Chorus]
(Those girls, those girls, those girls, those girls)
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me
I was just playin' the game
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)

[Snoop Dogg]
It was Kim, Dalesa, Vanessa, Rene
I don't love hoes or respect what they say
Hey... yeah that's life
The Pound comin' through, get the F out the way
I know it's been a minute but your boy been away
It feels so good, take me back in the day
I hit the studio, then back to the stage
The lights come on and the people start to wave
Then I seen this girl, she looked me right in the face
Like "I know you remember me and my homegirl Tanay"
We stay downtown in a loft on Santa Fe
And we your number one biggest fans to this day
Wait... baby girl I'm the great
Bigg Snoop Dogg, you got to bring me up to date
I know a lot of girls rock shows in many states
Room 220, bring your friend and some drank

[Chorus]
(Those girls, those girls, those girls, those girls)
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me
I was just playin' the game
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)

[Snoop Dogg]
Now where you gonna find a nigga fresh like me bitch?
Somebody pass the lighter so I can get this weed lit
She lookin' at my stones like "Damn, is he rich?"
I'm lookin' at her pose like damn is she thick
Fuck them other dudes, I'm the man to be with
Fifty million sold, who's bigger than me bitch?
Nobody, let me put you on to some G shit
Hop in the Benz, I'll get you higher than ski lifts
And then I'm bout to beat the cat up like Heathcliff
Yeah, 'cause all bitches need dick
And if they say they don't they just lyin', they wanna sit
shotgun in the 500 like she the shit
Uh-uh, hold on baby, we the shit
Clear blue skies, dip 'til you're seasick
You're with the one and only

[Chorus]
(Those girls, those girls, those girls, those girls)
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me

// One Chance (Make It Good) //

[Chorus - X2]
(Make It Good) You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line
Player it's your time to (Make It Good)

[Snoop Dogg]
Now you've been waitin', patient
Dinner datin', classic chasin'
Your homies hatin', 'cause you're never around
You're either at the movies or you're out shoppin' around
All that for the cat, it's a wrap
You gotta go hard if you get a chance to hit that
If you hit it then you gotta hit it harder
than any other brotha, the Karma Sutra be the author
Be her father, be a man, be the man
that made her never wanna see another man
Make it better than good, make it great
Make her visit, then make her stay

[Chorus - X2]
(Make It Good) You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line
Player it's your time to (Make It Good)

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah man, if you got a real one
You better hold on to her
See 'cause a real man will come along the way
And smooth knock her... 

If you like her, wife her
If you love her, smother her
With that stuff that'll make her feel the same way
And pull that ring out on the same day
A couple heirs with the horse and the carriage
You gon' lose if you scared of marriage
A real boss got a foundation
You need somebody in your life with patience
minus the hate... Shante what more can I say?
But baby look at us today
Your husband's a boss, the kids is cute
King of the Coast with a gang of loot

[Chorus - X2]
(Make It Good) You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line
Player it's your time to (Make It Good)

[Snoop Dogg]
I'ma make it good for you, make it hood for you
Make it do what he couldn't do for you
Tha Doggfather supreme, jump in the shower
I appear through the steam
Braids and all, over six foot tall
Can't no other brotha fade the Dogg
I'm all ya need, I'm who ya want
I'm here to coach ya through your do's and don'ts and he won't
I got the remedy, the energy
It's your mama, your daddy, and then it's me
Bad talk a boss, I wish a player would
Close your eyes baby girl, let me (Make It Good)

// Why Did You Leave Me //

[Snoop Dogg]
Bada-bing, bada-boom, what a dogg gotta do?
Let me holler at you boo, damn I miss you
I just wanna kiss you, and all that good stuff
Was I really all that bad or was I good enough?
I'm under pressure, I can't run plays like this
My mama always said that there'll be days like this
I'm all alone by the phone, in a zone, face is stone
Wonderin', if you ever comin' home
I try to run the streets and play
But that feeling just won't go away
My whole life I'd throw away, to get you back on my team
Damn, why'd you have to go away?

[Chorus]
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy

(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
You can't leave me by myself like this
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
Mama told me there'll be days like this

[Snoop Dogg]
I get up early in the mornin', miss your rudeness and kissin'
I also miss that smell of that good breakfast in the kitchen
Listen, I'm a star but I'm wishin'
To follow you wherever you are
You the wheels to my car, and I can't roll without you
My heart is a ice box, it's cold without you
Why'd you have to, leave me this way?
I'm doin' bad, you don't wanna see me this way
I'm at the pad, tryin' to do my best
I'm so stressed, and yes I'm still the King of the West
Tryin' to manage, and I'm gon' handle it
I need you back in my life, 'cause I'm tired of livin' scandalous

[Chorus]
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy

(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
You can't leave me by myself like this
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
Mama told me there'll be days like this

[Snoop Dogg]
Oh my Lord, I'm sittin' at the board with my head down
I can't write my next line, I need to lay it down
Hmm, I'm stuck like a dump truck
Lookin' stupid, cupid down on my luck
I touch a four leaf clover
Hopin' for somethin' good, like I should
If not I guess it's over
Baby be real with it
Do you love me, do you miss me?
I can't deal with it

[Chorus]
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy

(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
You can't leave me by myself like this
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
Mama told me there'll be days like this

// Can't Say Goodbye //

[Chorus (Charlie Wilson):]
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these precious in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting Grammies
But these streets won't say a goodbye

I can't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the streets (to my problems)
I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
I can't say goodbye goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
Goodbye
To the hood
I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the homies

[VERSE - SNOOP DOGG]
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me "just leave it alone boy,
Let them do them take care of your own boy"
But I said back brake a bound, before I was drome boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po
Banging for the truth, late night huntin'
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse

[Chorus]

[VERSE - SNOOP DOGG]
To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made
Me, tough enough to hang on the corners that would moul me
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,
But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted
To the life, you just don't OD, I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my momma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and cops
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams ??
The reason I'm so nice with my hands ?? shit, you think I forgot, man

[Chorus]

[VERSE - SNOOP DOGG]
Thank good every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more awards to get
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit
They made me how I am, the music in the man
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub and the pin with my man
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all come down and my carrier was to end, I'm sure my name
Would live.. in the streets

[Chorus]

I just can't say goodbye

I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

You can take the man out the streets,
But you can't take the streets out the man
