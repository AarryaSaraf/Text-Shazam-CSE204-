Just kick a lil' somethin' for them cars that be bumpin'
Yeah, alright, but we need a beat that can front too
Oh, that work
Be funky, you know what I'm sayin'?
Fly ride by, fly ride by with the boomin' system
Fly ride by with the boomin' system (Funky)
Fly ride by
For all the cars out there (Fly ride by)
And all the brothers that like to front your eye (Fly ride by)
Check this out

You know it's funky, funky, funky, 'cause you heard it from hearsay
A jam, that your mother don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around
Twelve o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights blinkin', 'cause your battery's drained
All my all on your tires and that big old chain
Parkin' outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the EQ and play connect the dots
Leanin' to the side, people everywhere
Trunk full of amps, it's ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in the back
All the Sadiddy, motherfuckers catch a heart attack
'Cause they don't understand why I act this way
Pump went up the funky beat, until the bread today
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by
And the bitches on my dick, 'cause I'm Soopafly

Fly ride by with the boomin' system
Fly ride by (Yo, just front)
Fly ride by with the boomin' system
Fly ride by

Bitches wanna ride with a nigga like me
'Cause they be hearin' me gettin' funky, frequently
They tell me "Don't drink and drive", I say "What is this?"
Pass the Moet and mind your business
Roll up a blunt, pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People outside see me boppin' my head
While I'm checkin' out the rapper and the rhymes that he said
I'm pimpin', and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car's like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise, it's three o'clock
The girl is a smile, she see me comin'
I'm steady hummin', I got the funky drummer drummin'
My trunk be chicken, vibratin' and rattlin'
Poppin' so loud, all the shorties be battlin'
My right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get, I'm showin' off my rings
I can keep it up, until the break of dome
'Cause I'm frontin' in my ride, and my word is bond

Fly ride by with the boomin' system (You know what I mean?)
Fly ride by (Frontin')
Fly ride by with the boomin' system
Fly ride by

Sunroof open, so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if you crash my back window
Y to the O, to the U, to the G
To the O, to the T, to the T to the A
To the D, to the O, to the I, to the T
To the period, that means I'm pimpin'
Like Snoop Dogg said, I leave a bitch for dead
Don't fuck up my lap and don't get too cozy
I got the gangster taste in the place
Like a bass-head would say, I want bass
I wanna hit, I wanna dose
You rollin' up, smilin', but you can't come close
'Cause my system is pumpin' loud
Like Rakim said, I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up, but can't fight the power with P.E
Tell the cops he gots to chill with EPMD
This is somethin' devastatin', vibratin' the trunk
Every minute Soopafly is like a fuser of the funk

Fly ride by with the boomin' system (You know what I mean?)
Fly ride by (Word)
Fly ride by with the boomin' system
Fly ride by ('Til the next time you are)
Fly ride by with the boomin' system (Ridin' in your shit)
Fly ride by (Pumpin' your shit)
Fly ride by with the boomin' system (Just remember)
Fly ride by (It's cool, peace)
