Album: Palomino

// In His Arms //

I've seen El Paso when the sky was on fire
Lost a night in Juarez a couple of times
Danced with a cowboy on a straight tequila high
I wish I was in his arms tonight

I've been a rolling stone, a tumbleweed
Looking for the right one to come find me
But the wrong one always set me free
I wish I was in his arms tonight

Is he playing in some house band in Dallas?
Is he breaking horses in San Antone?
Is he all alone in the neon light?
I wish I was in his arms tonight

Is he praying for rain out in West Texas?
Is he lost in the Marfa lights?
Is he out there looking for me?
Wishing I was in his arms tonight

I wish I was in his arms tonight

// Waxahachie //

Nobody ever left New Orleans as mad as I was
I wrote a lipstick letter on the mirror with a bourbon buzz
You were right, it got about as bad as it gets
I'm not lookin' for a turnaround tempo on the rubble strips

Waxahachie
Are you still on 35?
Are you still an all-night drive
From Louisiana?
Waxahachie
I can be there by 4 a.m.
Lookin' for a long-lost friend
That's what you've always been
Waxahachie
Ooh
Waxahachie

If I could just get down the road a beat
It won't be that hard
I can run from the demons like the devil in a speedin' car
I've got enough gasoline, memories and nicotine
Freedom's overrated, guess I underestimated the truth
And you

Waxahachie
Are you still on 35?
Are you still an all-night drive
From Louisiana?
Waxahachie
I can be there by 4 a.m.
Lookin' for a long-lost friend
That's what you've always been
Waxahachie
Ooh
Waxahachie

Waxahachie
Are you still on 35?
Are you still an all-night drive
From Louisiana?
Waxahachie
It's comin' on 4 a.m.
I need to be in your arms again
Lookin' for my long-lost friend
Waxahachie
Ooh
Waxahachie

// Geraldene //

I could see you coming all the way from Amarillo
Truck stop red lips pullin' on some nicotine
Shining like the spokes on a brand new El Dorado
You're trailer park pretty, but you're never gonna be Jolene

Geraldene, Geraldene
Why you gotta make memean
Don't make me cause a scene now, Geraldene
Geraldene, Geraldene
You get 'em all on their knees
But you can't take a man from me
Geraldene

If I was a man I'd make you my Dallas Alice
I'd put a leftover pawn shop ring on your left hand
You're never gonna be the backstage babe at the Crystal Palace
You're too late baby, I'm the only bitch in the band

Geraldene, Geraldene
Why you got to be so mean
Don't make me cause a scene now, Geraldene
Geraldene, Geraldene
You got 'em all on their knees
But you can't take a man from me
Geraldene

Geraldene, Geraldene
Why you got to be so mean
Don't make me cause a scene now, Geraldene
Geraldene, Geraldene
You got 'em all on their knees
But you can't take a man from me
Geraldene

Geraldene, Geraldene
Geraldene, Geraldene
Geraldene, Geraldene

// Actin' Up //

Mirror, mirror on the saddle, hear my rhinestones rattle
Actin' up
Billy Bob Texas pickin' out new exes
Actin' up
If you really wanna want me, I'll be riding on my pony
Just a-singing "Mony Mony"
'Cause I'm, mmmm, I'm actin' up

Even Tiger Woods couldn't swing it this good
I'm actin' up
My McQueen Mustang, hundred dollars in the tank
Gas it up
I'm out in the Mojave, call me Ricky, call me Bobby
Call me hotter than wasabi
'Cause I'm, mmmm, I'm actin' up

I want a sunset ride, a velvet rodeo
A Colorado high, a California glow
I want to see the desert from a painted palomino
Senorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up

Looking for the lightning, when I find it then I rhyme it
Actin' up
Little lone star Elvis, gonna get a little selfish
Shackin' up
With my microphone money bought my own milk and honey
Got my own kind of country, kinda funky
Turn it up

I want a sunset ride, a velvet rodeo
A Colorado high, a California glow
I want to see the desert from a painted palomino
Senorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up

I got a heart on fire, boy, don't you want to hold it?
I'm a really good trip, don't you wanna go on it

I want a sunset ride, a velvet rodeo
A Colorado high, a California glow
I want to see the desert from a painted palomino
Senorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up

I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up

// Scenes //

I met a trucker named Dwayne south of the 10
Got a gin and juice at the Satellite Inn
I was gettin' loose, making new friends
Anything to forget about you

Then I moved on to the KOA
Met an old hippie named Katie with a K
Went skinny dipping in Havasu Lake
Anything to forget about you

Another Fleetwood dream
Another sunset scheme
Another turn a new leaf
Movin' right along to the next scene
Another motel room
Another crescent moon
Between me and you
Movin' right along to the next scene

I hit the badlands fast I was zig zag rollin'
High on a Harley didn't care where I was going
Said "call me the Queen of South Dakota"
Anything to forget about you

Took my time on the way down to Reno
Jumped in the back of a black El Camino
Won fun money at the Gold Casino
Anything to forget about you

Another Fleetwood dream
Another sunset scheme
Another turn a new leaf
Movin' right along to the next scene
Another motel room
Another crescent moon
Between me and you
Movin' right along to the next scene

Another Fleetwood dream
Another sunset scheme
Another turn a new leaf
Movin' right along to the next scene
Another motel room
Another crescent moon
Between me and you
Movin' right along to the next scene

Santa Monica coaster
Put me on a poster
That's all she wrote, sir
Movin' right along to the next scene

// Tourist //

I'm sunny-side and over easy
Hundred miles from Alameda
Stopping by and taking in the view
Just pickin' up a souvenir
Swap a story, share a beer
Feel the itch that makes me wanna move

'Cause there's always been a stranger in my soul
Who loves a good goodbye and a good hello

I'm just a tourist
I don't know where I belong, it might sound foolish
Yeah, but nowhere feels like home
So I roam from town to town
Taking snapshots of the world
And I laugh away the lonely
And give a local bar a whirl
And I wanna see it all so I keep movin'
I'm just a tourist

I'm the guitar case and a denim jacket
If I don't need it I don't pack it
Mama always told me, "Travel light"
I'm better on the interstate
I'll hitch a ride or take a train
Always one more postcard I can write

I guess Hohenwald is my hometown for now
I'll sit a spell but I won't hang around

'Cause I'm just a tourist
I don't know where I belong, it might sound foolish
Yeah, but nowhere feels like home
So I roam from town to town
Taking snapshots of the world
And I laugh away the lonely
And give the local bar a whirl
And I wanna see it all so I keep movin'
I'm just a tourist

I'll take a couple memories but I won't stay behind
I'll never be a number on a population sign

'Cause I'm just a tourist
I don't know where I belong, it might sound foolish
Yeah, but nowhere feels like home
So I roam from town to town
Taking snapshots of the world
And I laugh away the lonely
And give a local bar a whirl
And I wanna see it all so I keep movin'
I'm just a tourist
I'm just a tourist

Mighty nice to meet ya
See you when I see ya

// Music City Queen //

She was the Belle of Biloxi back in her day
Shreveport sailing all the way to the bank
She was fish net fancy for a buffet line
Had the same red carpet since '79
She was ha-ha staying alive

Rolling down the river on the Music City Queen
Cumberland water, yeah life is but a dream
Show boat baby, gonna make a little green
Rolling down the river on a Music City Queen

Rolling down the river
Yeah, we're rolling down the river

Terry kinda thinks he's Jerry Lee Lewis
Plays "Great Balls of Fire" like there ain't nothing to it
Tina never quite had a Hollywood body
But she makes a damn good look-alike Dolly (Wooh, Dolly)
Working 9 to 5

But 'round about 10:30 (10:30)
All the jokes
They get dirty (That's dirty)
And the waitress
She gets flirty (You're flirty)
In the right light
She kinda purty
Everybody just

Rolling down the river on the Music City Queen
Cumberland water, yeah life is but a dream
Show boat baby, gonna make a little green
Rolling down the river on a Music City Queen
Music City Queen

If your heyday is faded
You can still be a star
Get to boozin' and cruisin'
Maritime is a charm
Didn't make it in Vegas
If the magic is gone
If your flashy and trashy
Come on and get on
Get on

And we're rolling down the river on the Music City Queen
Cumberland water, yeah life is but a dream
She's a show boat baby, no it ain't high seas
Rolling down the river on a Music City Queen
Get on

She's a show boat baby
And we're rolling down the river
A rockin' river lady
Yeah, we're rolling down the river
It's a dream
Yeah, we're rolling down the river
Come on, get on

// Strange //

Coyotes on my left and wolves on my right
Sun keeps shining in the middle of the night
Urban feels suburban, Main Street ain't main, yeah
And times like these make me feel strange

A Lincoln came and a Jefferson went
Money on a Maytag and the thing won't spin
Couple hundred dollars feels more like change, yeah
And times like these make me feel strange

Have a smoke, buy a round
Get on a jet liner going anywhere bound
Pick a string, sing the blues
Dance a hole in your shoes
Do anything to keep you sane
'Cause times like these make me feel strange
Times like these make me feel strange

Country don't twang, rock 'n' roll ain't loud
Every elevator only ever goes down
Everybody's looking for a little cheap fame, yeah
And times like these make me feel strange

Have a smoke, buy a round
Get on a jet liner going anywhere bound
Pick a string, sing the blues
Dance a hole in your shoes
Do anything to keep you sane
'Cause times like these make me feel strange
Times like these make me feel strange

Have a smoke, buy a round
Get on a jet liner going anywhere bound
Pick a string, sing the blues
Dance a hole in your shoes
Do anything to keep you sane

If Monday didn't bring you a grin that's alright
Pour you up a little something 'cause tomorrow might
Play a guitar as you're rollin' away singin'
Times like these make me feel strange
Times like these make me feel strange

Ain't it strange?
Ain't it strange?

// Wandering Spirit //

When all twelve of the Apostles try to ring me on the phone
Take a message but I won't return their call
For I have no eyes to see him and I thought I lost my way
And I know I've lost the keys to the door

And I climbed the highest mountain and I looked down at the sea
And I saw a ship a-sailing to the shore
I took a passage to the East and then I journeyed to the West
And I made love from Battambang to Baltimore

And I said, oh, am I running in a race?
I said, oh, am I getting anyplace?
And I said, oh, can I make it?

I'm a wandering spirit
Wandering spirit, yeah
Wandering spirit
And I'm a restless soul

I was a glutton at the banquet and I spilt the finest wine
Trod the pyramids and ruins of Angkor
And I kissed the Mona Lisa and had breakfast with the king
And I touched the nerves of nature in the raw

And I said, oh, am I running in a race?
I said, oh, am I getting anyplace?
And I said, oh, can I make it?

I'm a wandering spirit
Wandering spirit, yeah
Wandering spirit
And I've no place to call my own

I said, oh, am I running in a race?
And I said, oh, am I getting anyplace?
And I said, oh, can I make it?
I can't make it

I'm a wandering spirit
Wandering spirit, yeah
I'm a wandering spirit
Wandering spirit, yeah
I'm a wandering spirit
Wandering spirit, yeah
Wandering spirit
Yeah, and I've no place to call my home

// I'll Be Lovin' You //

Every highway
Every stranger that I met
Well, I went my way
But I never really left
And when I'm lonely
And I'm needing something new
When I'm lost in the mazes and turning the phrases and looking for something true

I'll be lovin' you
No matter where I roam
I'll be lovin' you
You're at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I'll do the only thing I know to do
I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you

Tried to find it
In the roses in the snow
Tried to climb it
In a Rocky Mountain low
I couldn't hide it
Like the bottle in my boot
When I'm deep in the dark and I look in my heart and I'm looking for something true

I'll be lovin' you
No matter where I roam
I'll be lovin' you
You're at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I'll do the only thing I know to do
I'll be lovin' you

Through the joy and the pain and the Mandolin Rain and the nights with the man in the moon
You'll always belong at the end of my song
Even if I'm out of tune

I'll be lovin' you
No matter where I roam
I'll be lovin' you
You're at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I'll do the only thing I know to do
I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you

// That's What Makes The Jukebox Play //

For the stranger drinking anger on the rocks at the end of the bar
For the Carolines sipping their wine hoping this is where the good ones are
For the lovers making out in a corner booth
For the one over there, don't think I didn't notice you

That's what makes the jukebox play
When you live like neon
There's a song you can lean on
That's what makes the jukebox play
When the night won't end
'Cause it plays over and over and over again

For the belt buckle shiner, she's starting all the fires in her Levi jeans
For the one who doesn't come here anymore 'cause he's getting over me
For the one stirring up her emotions in the ice with her fingertips
She showed up with somebody but that ain't who she's leaving with

That's what makes the jukebox play
When you live like neon
There's a song you can lean on
That's what makes the jukebox play
When the night won't end
'Cause it plays over and over and over again

For my old dive bar with the hand drawn heart. hanging lonely on the bathroom door
For the old dance hall with the mirror ball throwing starlight on the floor

That's what makes the jukebox play
When you live like neon
There's a song you can lean on
That's what makes the jukebox play
When the night won't end
'Cause it plays over and over and over again

It plays over and over and over

// Country Money //

Connie Johnson got a farm in Wisconsin
And a diesel in the drive and her air horn's honking
Got a pocket full of Benji's and her new Luccheses
And the best beef in the cheese state, baby

Carol Jean, she's the chicken egg queen
Yeah, she started with a dozen, now she's living the dream
She's a bad mother clucker with a house on the hill
Rides her hens around town in a Coup de Ville

Making country money
Making that country money
Down in Cash Cow County where the bills really grow on trees
Making that country money
Dripping like local honey
You can't tell by her britches, but she's one rich S.O.B

Carter Sisters got the good corn liquor
Get the one with the peaches, it'll get you there quicker
Guess their moonshine mama taught 'em the deal
'Cause there's gold dripping out of that still

They're making that country money
Making that country money
Down in Cash Cow County where the bills really grow on trees
Making that country money
Dripping like local honey
You can't tell by her britches, but she's one rich S.O.B

Making it rain on the cornfield
Raking it in with the windmill
While the combine's kicking up nickels right out of the dirt

Making that country money
Making that country money
Down in Cash Cow County where the bills really grow on trees
Spending that country money
Dripping like local honey
You can't tell by her britches, but she's one rich S.O.B

// If I Was A Cowboy //

Ridin' off in the sunset, blue eyes under my Stetson
A little lady on the front porch wishin' my heart would start settling
Big iron hips with the holsters
I'd be lookin' mighty fine on a poster
Wanted by the law but the laws don't apply to me

If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free
Rollin' around these towns like tumbleweeds
I'd be a legend at loving and leaving
Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings
You thought the West was wild but you ain't saddled up with me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be the queen

Sittin' pretty on the prairie, baby, I'm your huckleberry, let me hold ya
This six-gun sugar's got a hairpin trigger, like I told ya
And this dove never really gets lonesome
I never begged, never borrowed but I stole some
Wanted by the law but the laws don't apply to me, baby

If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free
Rollin' around these towns like tumbleweeds
I'd be a legend at loving and leaving
Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings
You thought the West was wild but you ain't saddled up with me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be the queen

So mamas if your daughters grow up
To be cowboys, so what

If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free
Rollin' around these towns like tumbleweeds
I'd be a legend at loving and leaving
Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings
You thought the West was wild but you ain't saddled up with me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be the queen, oh
I'd be the queen

// Pursuit Of Happiness //

Took a heartbreak off the coast of Maine
Came up short and I tried again
Then New York stole the heart right off my sleeve
Fell asleep with a broken wheel
And something kept me rolling still
Both eyes closed waiting for the American dream

Yeah, I'm runnin' just as fast as my heart can
Some call me a fool and some just call it restlessness
But I keep on runnin'
Changing tires and changing plans
I call it my pursuit of happiness

Found a song in Carolina
Left a tip at every diner
Always running late on Eastern time
Put a hundred in the offering plate
And wondered if those pearly gates
Would open if I found the perfect rhyme

Yeah, I'm runnin' just as fast as my heart can
Some call me a fool and some just call it restlessness
But I keep on runnin'
Changing tires and changing plans
I call it my pursuit of happiness

It's a stranger, it's a dollar, it's my name on a big marquee
It's a million miles away, and it's right in front of me

Yeah, I keep on runnin' just as fast as my heart can
Some call me a fool and some just call it restlessness
But I keep on runnin'
Changing tires and changing plans
I call it my pursuit of happiness

Yeah, it's all just my pursuit of happiness

// Carousel //

Pretty Elaina
My fair lady
She walked the high wire back in the 80's
Feathers and sequins
She shined like a chandelier
Hanging from the top tent rafters
Till the spotlight disappeared

Harlan Giovanni
What a sight to see
The way he earned her trust was on a 20-foot trapeze
She fell so hard because he always let her fly
Till he left her heart suspended
In a cotton candy sky
She still don't know why

Every show must end
Every circus leaves town
You don't know the magic's gone
Until the lights go down
Now she's back in Nacogdoches
And I hear she's doing well
She only misses Harlan when she hears a carousel

Pretty Elaina
Made herself a nest
Her sequins and her secrets
Buried in her cedar chest
No one around here knows about her other life
Johnny Davis went and made her a mama and a wife
And maybe that's alright

'Cause every show must end
Every circus leaves town
You don't know the magic's gone
Until the lights go down
Now she's back in Nacogdoches
And I hear she's doing well
She only misses Harlan when she hears a carousel

Smith County Fair
Mid-September
She walks the midway
And smiles when she remembers

Every show must end
Every circus leaves town
I didn't know the magic left
Till all the lights went down
Now I'm back in Nacogdoches
And I swear I'm doing well
I only miss my Harlan when I hear a carousel
I only miss my Harlan when I hear a carousel
