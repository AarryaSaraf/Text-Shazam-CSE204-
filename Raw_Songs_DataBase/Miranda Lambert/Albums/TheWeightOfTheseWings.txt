// Runnin' Just In Case //

There's trouble where I'm going, but I'm gonna go there anyway
I hate Sunday mornings cause they always seem to start this way

I'm looking for a lighter, I already bought the cigarettes
Guess I picked me up a habit on my way out of Lafayette

Eastbound and down
I turn it up cause thats sure how I feel

My mind is racing through the pines
My hands are shaky on the steering wheel

I'm going north on 59, but I know good and well I'm heading south
Cause me and Birmingham don't have a history of working out

What I lost in Louisiana
I found back in Alabama
But nobody ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm runnin' just in case

I ain't unpacked my suitcase since the day that I turned 21
It's been a long ten years since then, It's getting kind of cumbersome

The first one, and the last one, and the one thats got my name in ink
The smoker, and the fighter, and the one in every song I sing

What I lost in Lubbock Texas
I look for in all the rest
But I guess no one ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm runnin' just in case

I carry them around with me, I don't mind having scars
Happiness ain't prison, but there's freedom in a broken heart

// Highway Vagabond //

I wanna go somewhere where nobody knows
I wanna know somewhere where nobody goes
Following gold lines on the ground, northbound, southbound
There's something 'bout the way I feel when the wheels go round and round and round

Highway vagabonds, living like hippies
Moving right along to the next big city
Okay, jump off the exit
Truck stop, rest stop, next stop Texas
Caravan like a wild west show
I don't care, man, as long as we go
My way
Get off one and get on the other
Highway, vagabonds

Daddy was a drifter, mama died young
I still don't know where I come from
On the map and off the grid with all my friends
Roaming town and town like Willie did when he was a kid, on the road again

Highway vagabonds, living like hippies
Moving right along to the next big city
Okay, jump off the exit
Truck stop, rest stop, next stop Texas
Caravan like a wild west show
I don't care, man, as long as we go
My way, singing for your supper
Get off one and get on the other
Highway, vagabonds

But if we ain't broke down then we ain't doing something right
But if we ain't broke down then we ain't slowing down tonight

Highway vagabonds, living like hippies
Moving right along to the next big city

Highway vagabonds, living like hippies
Moving right along to the next big city
Okay, jump off the exit
Truck stop, rest stop, next stop Texas
Caravan like a wild west show
I don't care, man, as long as we go
My way, singing for your supper
Get off one and get on the other
Highway, vagabonds

Highway vagabonds
Highway vagabonds
Living like hippies (highway vagabonds)
Moving right along to the next big city
Living like hippies (highway vagabonds)
Moving right along to the next big city (highway vagabonds)
Living like highway vagabonds (highway vagabonds)

// Ugly Lights //

I don't remember when the liquor started kicking in
It's been awhile since I've been off the stuff

I really hate to say I'm turning into a cliche
I'm hoping that nobody brings it up

I left my car behind the bar again last Sunday night
I did the Monday morning drive of shame

In last nights clothes they smell like smoke
But I don't know how I got home
But I do know my head will hurt all day

But I'm still going to stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeo's and Juliet's have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on

Well everybody's got a spark
It's easy hiding in the dark
In a crowded room with pockets full of rings

I sit and watch the whiskey pour
The married men, the exit door
The beginning of another matchbook flame

And I don't try to justify the reason I'm not livin' right
I wear my sadness like a souvenir

I drink too much to fall apart
That's how I fight this broken heart
So what, if I feel comfortable in here

But I'm still going to stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeo's and Juliet's have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on

Hey!

// You Wouldn't Know Me //

You wouldn't know me if you saw me here
Wake up at your front door no more
You'll never know me by asking how I've been
You'll never keep up that way

Stop sign, stop sign
That's all she threw at me
'Til I don't feel like home no more

Wings on fire I caught side of a brand new home 
Married in your heels

I told her you wouldn't know me if you saw me here
Wake up at your front door no more
You'll never know me by asking how I've been
You'll never keep up that way
That's what I say

Bad news is better than what you've been handing me
What's gone wrong with you my friend
Promise me, promise me 
Don't laugh out at me now
Won't you just send me some word

I told her you wouldn't know me if you saw me here
I'm changing day to day, that's right
You'll never know me by asking how I've been
You'll never keep up that way
That's what I say

I told her you wouldn't know me if you saw me here
I'm changing day to day, that's right
You'll never know me by asking how I've been
You'll never keep up that way

Well you wouldn't know me 
You wouldn't know me

// We Should Be Friends //

If your mind's as cluttered as your kitchen sink
If your heart's as empty as your diesel tank
If all your white t-shirts have stains
If you've got some guts and got some ink
Well then, we should be friends

If you borrow dresses like you borrow time
If you dream all day and drink all night
If you're looking for love but willing to fight
Over men and momma's and Miller Lite
Well then, we should be friends

I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I read the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

If you paint your nails while you cut your loss
If you like acting like you're the boss
If everything your daddy says
Is something you can put stock in
Well then, we should be friends

I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I wrote the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

One, two, three..

If you use alcohol as a sedative
And bless your heart as a negative
If you ride your white horse like the wind
If what you see is what you get
Well then, oh, we should be friends
(Alright)

Well then, oh, we should be friends
Well then, oh, we can be friends

// Pink Sunglasses //

I put 'em on when ever I sit down to read the paper
Can't explain the way they seem to work like magic

I put 'em on to keep it positive
Don't mean to tell you how to feel
But I'm a firm believer in the power of the plastic
Positive plastic

In my pink sunglasses
Always makes the world look a little bit better
In my pink sunglasses
You can try'em anytime you need a change of the weather
9.99 I'm perfectly disguised
When I'm walking by I wanna roll my eyes
In my Pink sunglasses
Pink sunglasses
Ahh-uhh-uhh

I was looking for some tortoise shells
But these were on sale, next to the disposable cameras
Tried 'em on and suddenly it occurred to me
Buying Little Debbie's felt a little more glamorous
In the check out line
Don't I look good
Uh 

In my pink sunglasses
Always makes the world look a little bit better
In my pink sunglasses
You can try'em anytime you need a change of the weather
9.99 I'm perfectly disguised
When I'm walking by I wanna roll my eyes
In my Pink sunglasses
Pink sunglasses
Ahh-uhh-uhh
Ahh-uhh-uhh

I can leave 'em on a beach, at a bar, a boat
But they always reappear in the pocket of my coat
I cant find 'em
They always find me

My pink sunglasses
Always makes the world look a little bit better
In my pink sunglasses
You can try'em anytime you need a change of the weather
9.99 completely polarized
Sometimes I accidentally go to bed at night
In my Pink sunglasses
My pink sunglasses
Ahh-uhh-uhh
Pink sunglasses
Ahh-uhh-uhh
In my pink sunglasses
Uhh
Pink sunglasses

// Getaway Driver //

When she's feeling reckless
Tangled in her messes
Wild eyes lookin' for a chase
There's nothing white lines can't erase

So I keep the engine running
She'll be my gasoline
She treats my heart like a stolen car
All the while she had the keys
Standing in the line of fire
I'll be right beside her
I'm her getaway driver
Her getaway driver

Miles were the only thing that saved us
Headlights were our only traces
No rearview mirror, no looking back
Desert horizon as our map

So I keep the engine running
She'll be my gasoline
She treats my heart like a stolen car
All the while she had the keys
Standing in the line of fire
I'll be right beside her
I'm her getaway driver
Her getaway driver

A lover and a fighter
Bonnie and Clyde reminder
I'm her getaway driver
Her getaway driver

// Vice //

Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice

All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely

It's gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice

Another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

I'll wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me

Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice

Another town, where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mmm, another vice

Standing at the sink not looking in the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Mmm another vice
Yes, another vice
Ooh, another vice
Another vice
Another vice
Another vice

// Smoking Jacket //

I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a deeper pocket with money to burn
I want a man who knows his status
And he makes a habit of loving me 'til it hurts

He might be heavy on the pedal
But he knows how to take it slow
He might be quite continental 
But he's sure gonna take me home, yes he is 

I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a car that's classic living bourgeoisie
I want a man who's heart is tragic
But he makes his magic every night on me

We go together just like nicotine and Chanel
And when he lights up I'm his Lucky Strike 
Waiting for him to exhale

I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a deeper pocket with money to burn
I want a man who knows his status
And he makes a habit of loving me 'til it hurts

I don't need a diamond
I like wearing his smoke rings

I want a man, I want a man

I want a man

I want a man with a smoking jacket
And he lights his matches with kerosene

I want a man, I want a man
I want a man with a smoking jacket

I want a man, I want a man
I want a man with a smoking jacket

// Pushin' Time //

Are we fools for rushin' in,
'Cause I already dread the end.
Lonely ain't no place to start;
I guess that's just where we are.

Oh, how I remember well 
Sunset on September 12.
I disappeared to get a drink; 
You still kept your eyes on me

Sometimes love acts out of spite,
And good things happen overnight.
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushing time

I didn't plan on fallin' fast;
I didn't know I could be kissed like that.
Now I'm tradin' miles for minutes.
This bed's too big without you in it.

Sometimes love acts out of spite,
And good things happen overnight.
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time

You and I are pushin' time

And they say only time can tell,
You already know me well.
If it has to end in tears, 
I hope it's in sixty years.

Sometimes love acts out of spite,
And good things happen overnight.
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time.
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time.

// Covered Wagon //

Get that lead out momma
Pack up everything we own
Smog's about to get me
And I've got a mind to roam
In my covered wagon
Honey down the road we go
On down the road we
On down the road we go

Got an itch to ramble
And I got no place to be
The people in the city
They ain't got no use for me
In my covered wagon
Momma down the road we go
On down the road we go
On down the road we go
Alright

Baby down the road we go
On down the road we go
On down the road we go

I'm headed for the country
Can't nothing keep me here
I feel so free and easy
Like a funky pioneer

In my covered wagon
Imma down the road we go
On down the road we go
In my covered wagon
Baby on down the road we go
On down the road we go
Down the road we go
On down the road we go
Baby down the road we go
On down the road we go
Baby down the road we go
On down the road we go
Honey down the road we go

Down the road I go
Down the road I go
Down the road I go
On down the road we go
Down the road I go
On down the road we go
Thats right

// Use My Heart //

I can't throw a line but I can reel it in
I can throw a dart but I can't make it stick
The thought of loving you just makes me sick
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
I don't have the nerve to use my heart

I can write the line but I can't sing the song
I can call my momma but I won't go home
The thought of loving you just makes me sick
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
I don't have the nerve to use my heart

I won't throw a punch but I will turn my cheek
I don't go to church no more but that's what I believe

I don't give two shits no more or so I say
It wouldn't make a difference to you anyway
The thought of loving you just makes me sick
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
I don't have the nerve to use my heart

I don't have the nerve to use my heart
I don't have the nerve to use my heart

I don't have the nerve to use my heart

Use my heart

// Good Ol' Days //

Oh southern breeze
Knock me to my knees
I believe you're the only one who can

The religious and the rest
They've all tried their best
Well I guess somethings you just don't understand

Oh Lord when will the road run out
I'm on the roll but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why
But still I second guess my place
What I stand to lose for winning
To find the truth I'm willing
Start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days

Oh southern pine
Reaching for a sky
I'm convinced that I can fly beneath your shade

And it's all overdue
Spendin' time just me and you
Mmm, the pulpit and pew where I was saved

Oh Lord when will the road run out
I'm on a roll but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why
But still I second guess my place
What I stand to lose for winning
To find the truth I'm willing
Start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days
Yeah

Oh Lord when will the road run out
I'm on a roll but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why
But still I second guess my place
What I stand to lose for winning
To find the truth I'm willing
Start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days

Oh southern breeze
Knock me to my knees
I believe you're the only one who can

// Things That Break //

I was born a bull in a china cabinet
Drawn to the delicate like it's a magnet
Perfume bottles on a mirror tray
Tempered glass on a window pane
Timeless face on a pocket watch
Time is ticking

I leave it all in ruins
Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break

Can't make a man a promise with the best of intentions
Or drive 200 miles on a rundown engine
Put a blanket underneath a hollow tree
When the wind blows hard it will fall on me
Stick around long enough and you will see
Time is ticking

I leave it all in ruins
Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break

Me I don't ever wanna get too close
Or be held responsible
For all the pain that you can't see
Somebody once broke me

I leave it all in ruins
Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break

// For The Birds //

I'm against the days
When skies stay bummer gray
And the cake taste just okay, okay?
Well I guess I'm anti-yuck
Against the stuff that sucks
The life out of your soul and shuts it down

I'm against the thought
Letting good tomatoes rot
Being someone that you're not, when you're not
Well I guess I'm anti-hate
Cause that ain't what it takes
It's love that makes this crazy world go round

I'm for the sun
I'm for the breeze
Old dogs sleeping at your feet
I'm for the girls with curls and the curves
I'm for questions
I'm for freedom
Celebrating every season
For the bees, and the trees, and the dirt
I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds

I'm against the notion
Of drinking with cheap potion
And causing big commotion
You know son?
I guess I'm anti confrontation
I'd rather have a conversation
About nothing in particular at all

I'm against them feelings
The ones that get revealing
Slamming hearts right into ceilings, Ya feel me?
And I guess I'm anti tears
I'd rather sip an ice cold beer
Listen to some country music until dawn

Cause I'm for the sun
I'm for the breeze
Old dogs sleeping at your feet
I'm for the girls with the curls and the curves
I'm for questions
I'm for freedom
Celebrating every season
For the trees, and the bees, and the dirt
I'm for feathers, I'm for wings, I'm for twiddle-le-de-de
For what it's worth, for what it's worth
I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds
I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds
I'm for the birds
Twiddle-le-de-de

// Well-Rested //

Well this moment is heavy
For me I'm not ready
Like a caged bird barely set free
Forgive me I'm finding my wings

While my body is present
My heart is absent
And my mind is racing
And my feet are pacing

It's your tail you're chasing
It's the past I'm erasing
And your heart can't be tested
When it ain't well-rested

My gears are grinding
I'm leaving, you're arriving
It's a matter of timing
I guess loving ain't surviving

It's your tail that you're chasing
It's the past I'm erasing
And a heart can't be tested
When it ain't well-rested

It's your tail that you're chasing
It's the past I'm erasing
And a heart can't be tested
When it ain't well-rested

Don't waste your investment
If a heart ain't well-rested
My heart ain't well-rested

// Tomboy //

Tomboy, Hail Mary
Never needs a dress to make her pretty
She's a killjoy, such as let down
Daddy tried to raise a southern belle
Well he got a tomboy

Tomboy in between
Dirt in her nails and holes in her jeans
She'll destroy all your dreams
And ride out like a rodeo queen
Know what I mean
She's a tomboy

Tangled hair and bruises on her knees
She wears her scars outside her sleeves
Always has a way of saying 'no way'
Some people don't get her but thats okay

Move along boy
She's a tomboy

Barfly, bad betty
Band of brothers that got her back
She's unlady like
Like a scout fire
Got her own constellation in the zodiac
Well, who can say that
A tomboy

Tangled hair and bruises on her knees
Shes hard to love and hard to please
Always has a way of saying 'no way'
Some people don't get her but thats okay

Move along boy
She's a tomboy

She's got a softer side she'll never let you see
With tears in her eyes she'd rather be caught dead
Sweet contradiction with no guarantees
She is what she is
You get what you get

Move along boy
She's a tomboy
Or go along with it boy
You got a tomboy

// To Learn Her //

To love her is to learn her
And see her at her worst
Dance with her when she's drinkin'
Hold her when she hurts
She'll be happy, you'll be sorry
Well, that's just how it works
To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn

You'll meet her momma
You'll love her daddy
You'll know how much she's worth
You'll have thanksgiving dinners
And Sunday morning church
You'll be true and you'll be tried
But the tables always turn
To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn

It's a lesson, it's a blessing
You don't know everything
If you take her you might hate her
And be left with just a ray

To love her is to lose her
Hey, that's just how it works
To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn

Oh to love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn

// Keeper Of The Flame //

I'm walking in their footsteps
I'm singing their old songs
Somebody blazed this trail
I'm treadin' on
I'm bent, but I'm not broken
I'm stronger than I feel
I'm made of flesh and bone
Not made of steel

I'm the keeper of the flame
The teller of the story
Keeper of the flame
For the ones that came before me
For the little pilot lights waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
Keeper of the flame

I've been burned out to ashes
Waiting for a wind
To carry me and start a fire again
Sometimes I'm just a flicker
A candle in your eye
But I swear to God
I'll never let it die

I'm the keeper of the flame
The teller of the story
Keeper of the flame
For the ones that came before me
For the little pilot lights waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
Keeper of the flame

When I'm drowning
When I'm fighting
When I'm screaming
When I'm hiding
When I'm losing
When I'm winning
I go back to
The beginning

Keeper of the flame
The teller of the story
Keeper of the flame
I'm not doing it for the glory
But for those little pilot lights waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
Keeper of the flame
I'm the keeper of the flame
Ooooh, oooh
I'm the keeper of the flame
Ooooh, oooh

// Bad Boy //

Saturday's gonna keep you up all night
'Cause Sunday morning ain't your style
It's been a while since I've seen the sun rise
I'm not sure how you make a living
You can buy me one of whatever you're drinking
I'm thinking my mama warned me about your kind
Sure, you can light my cigarette
Don't think you can light my heart
Don't think I haven't figured you out from the start

Giving in to bad boys like you never got me very far
It's trouble now, baby drink it down
You should have seen it coming

Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, for you
Bad boy, maybe it's a bad choice
I've got it bad boy for you

The more I hear your silence speak
The more my curiosity peaks
The more I don't wanna leave this bar alone
The whisky's making me wonder why
You wear your hat down low, but your walls are high
How long you gonna hide behind them walls of stone?
Sure, you can buy me one more round
Don't think you can buy my heart
Don't think I haven't figured you out from the start

Giving in to bad boys like you never got me very far
It's trouble now, baby drink it down
You should have seen it coming

Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, for you
Bad boy, maybe it's a bad choice
I've got it bad boy, bad boy, for you

You should have seen it coming
Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, for you
Bad boy, maybe it's a bad choice
I've got it bad boy, bad boy
Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, bad boy

// Six Degrees Of Separation //

Thought that I was safe down in New Orleans
'Til I picked up a quarter from 1979
Stuck it in the back pocket of these jeans
Worn in boyfriend button down Levis
In the saints town I can't seem to figure out
How to get around, but I ain't moving on
Threw the quarter in an old street case
And I'll be damned, he started playing our song

Six degrees of separation
You're all over this damn nation
But I'm out of your reach geographically
But you still find a way to get a hold on me
And it's six degrees of separation

Hailed a cab up in NYC
Saw an ad for a litigation lawyer on a bus stop bench
Sitting waiting for the red light to turn green
Smoke-breakers flirting on the steps of Merrill Lynch
Hit the Roosevelt, took it to the 12th
Got a funny feeling as I put my key in the door
Never seen the likes of these city lights
I swear to god, son I've been here before

Six degrees of separation
You're all over this damn nation
I'm out of your reach geographically
You still find a way to get a hold on me
And it's six degrees of separation

Well, it's six degrees of separation
Yeah, it's six degrees of separation

Thought that I was safe down in New Orleans
'Til I picked up a quarter from 1979

// Dear Old Sun //

Dear old sun
How you holding up
Through the winter cold
Up there all alone
February's been hard on a heart
But we're near the end
And it's almost march
Though the sky's been grey
And in our way I still see your light

Well, you melt the snow
And you grow the roses
And you dry the tears
And you freckle noses
Our little world
Revolves around you
Coming up and going down

Oooooo

Dear old sun
Lets call it a day
And I watch you set
I'll let you rest
But wait for you
At mornings due
Till I see your light

Oooooo

I still see your light
I still see your light
Heaven shining down tonight
I still see your light


I still see your light
I still see your light
Heaven shining down tonight
I still see your light

Oooooo

// I've Got Wheels //

Sometimes these wings
Get a little heavy
I can't stay between the lines but I'm rocking steady
When I can't fly, I start to fall
But I've got wheels
I'm rolling on

I can't count time
I can't count money
But I've been counting every mile for a month on sunday
Whatever road, however long
I've got wheels
I'm rolling on

Sometimes these wings
Get a little heavy
And I can't stay between the lines but I'm rocking steady
When I can't fly, I start to fall
But I've got wheels
I'm rolling on

And when I find a place to rest
I'll stay just long enough to catch my breath
This life with you will keep me strong
Damn these wheels
I'm rolling on

Sometimes these wings
Get a little heavy
And I can't stay between the lines but I'm rocking steady
When I can't fly, I start to fall
But I've got wheels
I'm rolling on

I've got wheels
I've got wheels
I've got wheels
I've got wheels
I've got wheels
I've got wheels
