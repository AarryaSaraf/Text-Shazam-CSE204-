Carrying the weight
On the end of a limb
You're just waitin' for somebody
To pick you up again

Shaded by a tree
Can't live up to a rose
All you ever wanted
Was a sunny place to grow

Pretty little thing
Sometimes you gotta look up
And let the world see
All the beauty that you're made of

'Cause the way you hang your head
Nobody can tell
You're my Virginia Bluebell
My Virginia Bluebell

Even through a stone
A flower can bloom
You just need a little push
Spring is coming soon

Umbrella in the rain
Let it roll off your back
Weather what you can
Realize what you have

Pretty little thing
Sometimes you gotta look up
And let the world see
All the beauty that you're made of

'Cause the way you hang your head
Nobody can tell
You're my Virginia Bluebell
My Virginia Bluebell

Put a little light in the darkest places
Put a little smile on the saddest faces

Pretty little thing
Sometimes you gotta look up
And let the world see
All the beauty that you're made of

'Cause the way you hang your head
Nobody can tell
You're my Virginia Bluebell
My Virginia Bluebell
