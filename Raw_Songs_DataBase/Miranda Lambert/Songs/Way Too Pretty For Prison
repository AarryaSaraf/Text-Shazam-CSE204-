They don't have rhinestone ball and chains
Lunch trays don't come with Chardonnay
The bars there ain't got boys to buy us drinks

We'd stick out like two bottled blondes
I must admit it don't sound fun
For fifteen girls to have to share one sink

He cheated, he's a villain
And you know I'd help you kill him

But we're way too pretty for prison
Hard time ain't our kind of living
And I don't want to talk about
The way those jumpsuits wash us out
We're way too pretty for prison

Antifreeze and Gatorade
Arsenic in his lemonade
Takes just one snip to bleed his brakes
But we ain't gonna do it
(She ain't gonna do it)

Yeah, we've been watching too much TV
You ain't Thelma, I ain't Louise
But if we ask 'em they'd both agree
We should put him through it
(Don't put him through it)

He cheated, he's a villain
So let's hire somebody to kill him

'Cause we're way too pretty for prison
Yeah, hard time ain't our kind of living
And I don't want to talk about
The way those jumpsuits wash us out
We're way too pretty for prison

La de da da da
(La de da da da)
La de da da da
(La de da da da)
La de da da
La de da da
La de da da da

Well, the state won't pay for lash extensions
No Sun Tan City, not to mention
That lack of waxing situation
Oh oh

'Cause we're way too pretty for prison
Hard time ain't our kind of living
I don't want to talk about
The way those jumpsuits wash us out
We're way too pretty for prison

La de da da da
(La de da da da)
La de da da da
(La de da da da)
La de da da
La de da da
La de da da da

La de da da da
La de da da da
La de da da
La de da da
