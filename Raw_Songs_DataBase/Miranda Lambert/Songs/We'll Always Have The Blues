Jukebox serenade
Sawdust under my Luccheses
Finally in each other arms
Singing "Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star"

It's only for tonight
It's almost closing time
Maybe one more dance for two
We can't have each other
But we'll always have the blues

It's not trouble, it's just dancin'
Just a couple second glances
You can't have me, I can't have you
That's why we'll always have the blues

If only for tonight
It's almost closing time
Maybe one more dance for two
We can't have each other
We'll always have the blues

If only for tonight
It's almost closing time
Give us one more dance for two
We'll never have each other
But we'll always have the blues

We can't have each other
But we'll always have the blues
