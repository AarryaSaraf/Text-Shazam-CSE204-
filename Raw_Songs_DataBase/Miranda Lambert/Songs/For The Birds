I'm against the days
When skies stay bummer gray
And the cake taste just okay, okay?
Well I guess I'm anti-yuck
Against the stuff that sucks
The life out of your soul and shuts it down

I'm against the thought
Letting good tomatoes rot
Being someone that you're not, when you're not
Well I guess I'm anti-hate
Cause that ain't what it takes
It's love that makes this crazy world go round

I'm for the sun
I'm for the breeze
Old dogs sleeping at your feet
I'm for the girls with curls and the curves
I'm for questions
I'm for freedom
Celebrating every season
For the bees, and the trees, and the dirt
I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds

I'm against the notion
Of drinking with cheap potion
And causing big commotion
You know son?
I guess I'm anti confrontation
I'd rather have a conversation
About nothing in particular at all

I'm against them feelings
The ones that get revealing
Slamming hearts right into ceilings, Ya feel me?
And I guess I'm anti tears
I'd rather sip an ice cold beer
Listen to some country music until dawn

Cause I'm for the sun
I'm for the breeze
Old dogs sleeping at your feet
I'm for the girls with the curls and the curves
I'm for questions
I'm for freedom
Celebrating every season
For the trees, and the bees, and the dirt
I'm for feathers, I'm for wings, I'm for twiddle-le-de-de
For what it's worth, for what it's worth
I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds
I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds, I'm for the birds
I'm for the birds
Twiddle-le-de-de
