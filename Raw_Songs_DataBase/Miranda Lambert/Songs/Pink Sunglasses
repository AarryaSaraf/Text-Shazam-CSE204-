I put 'em on when ever I sit down to read the paper
Can't explain the way they seem to work like magic

I put 'em on to keep it positive
Don't mean to tell you how to feel
But I'm a firm believer in the power of the plastic
Positive plastic

In my pink sunglasses
Always makes the world look a little bit better
In my pink sunglasses
You can try'em anytime you need a change of the weather
9.99 I'm perfectly disguised
When I'm walking by I wanna roll my eyes
In my Pink sunglasses
Pink sunglasses
Ahh-uhh-uhh

I was looking for some tortoise shells
But these were on sale, next to the disposable cameras
Tried 'em on and suddenly it occurred to me
Buying Little Debbie's felt a little more glamorous
In the check out line
Don't I look good
Uh 

In my pink sunglasses
Always makes the world look a little bit better
In my pink sunglasses
You can try'em anytime you need a change of the weather
9.99 I'm perfectly disguised
When I'm walking by I wanna roll my eyes
In my Pink sunglasses
Pink sunglasses
Ahh-uhh-uhh
Ahh-uhh-uhh

I can leave 'em on a beach, at a bar, a boat
But they always reappear in the pocket of my coat
I cant find 'em
They always find me

My pink sunglasses
Always makes the world look a little bit better
In my pink sunglasses
You can try'em anytime you need a change of the weather
9.99 completely polarized
Sometimes I accidentally go to bed at night
In my Pink sunglasses
My pink sunglasses
Ahh-uhh-uhh
Pink sunglasses
Ahh-uhh-uhh
In my pink sunglasses
Uhh
Pink sunglasses
