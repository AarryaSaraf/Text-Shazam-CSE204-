Every highway
Every stranger that I met
Well, I went my way
But I never really left
And when I'm lonely
And I'm needing something new
When I'm lost in the mazes and turning the phrases and looking for something true

I'll be lovin' you
No matter where I roam
I'll be lovin' you
You're at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I'll do the only thing I know to do
I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you

Tried to find it
In the roses in the snow
Tried to climb it
In a Rocky Mountain low
I couldn't hide it
Like the bottle in my boot
When I'm deep in the dark and I look in my heart and I'm looking for something true

I'll be lovin' you
No matter where I roam
I'll be lovin' you
You're at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I'll do the only thing I know to do
I'll be lovin' you

Through the joy and the pain and the Mandolin Rain and the nights with the man in the moon
You'll always belong at the end of my song
Even if I'm out of tune

I'll be lovin' you
No matter where I roam
I'll be lovin' you
You're at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I'll do the only thing I know to do
I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you
