It's hard to see the writing
On the wall that I keep fighting
My eyes are closed
My fists are clenched
Trying to find forgiveness is like breaking into prison
Getting caught up on a razor wire fence
Always give it one more day
Thunder clouds roll away
I already know
Dust ain't ever gonna settle
The wind's just gonna blow

I used to make you love me
Laugh and want to touch me
Now I drink alone and cry at my own jokes
Your halo's in the dresser drawer
And I don't wear my ring no more
Kids and time will learn to love us both
We both hate to see it end
Skies are getting dark again
It's time for me to go
Dust ain't ever gonna settle
The wind's just gonna blow

Sing along storms never last
Bad times, they all pass
For me and you they don't
Dust ain't ever gonna settle
The wind's just gonna blow
