She was the Belle of Biloxi back in her day
Shreveport sailing all the way to the bank
She was fish net fancy for a buffet line
Had the same red carpet since '79
She was ha-ha staying alive

Rolling down the river on the Music City Queen
Cumberland water, yeah life is but a dream
Show boat baby, gonna make a little green
Rolling down the river on a Music City Queen

Rolling down the river
Yeah, we're rolling down the river

Terry kinda thinks he's Jerry Lee Lewis
Plays "Great Balls of Fire" like there ain't nothing to it
Tina never quite had a Hollywood body
But she makes a damn good look-alike Dolly (Wooh, Dolly)
Working 9 to 5

But 'round about 10:30 (10:30)
All the jokes
They get dirty (That's dirty)
And the waitress
She gets flirty (You're flirty)
In the right light
She kinda purty
Everybody just

Rolling down the river on the Music City Queen
Cumberland water, yeah life is but a dream
Show boat baby, gonna make a little green
Rolling down the river on a Music City Queen
Music City Queen

If your heyday is faded
You can still be a star
Get to boozin' and cruisin'
Maritime is a charm
Didn't make it in Vegas
If the magic is gone
If your flashy and trashy
Come on and get on
Get on

And we're rolling down the river on the Music City Queen
Cumberland water, yeah life is but a dream
She's a show boat baby, no it ain't high seas
Rolling down the river on a Music City Queen
Get on

She's a show boat baby
And we're rolling down the river
A rockin' river lady
Yeah, we're rolling down the river
It's a dream
Yeah, we're rolling down the river
Come on, get on
