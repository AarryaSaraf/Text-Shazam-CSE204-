Sometimes you read it like a school kid writing on chalkboard walls
Sometimes it hits you like the water rollin' over Niagara Falls
Cheeks get flushed like the first time buzz on Cabernet
Boots on the bleachers, the edge of the seaters, just watching you entertain

You show up and put a spell on me
Mmm, the nerve

How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love

The needle and the ink, don't need to overthink, it's there for good
Leave me you'd never, this is forever, knock on wood
Tender in my chest, the hell with the rest, we're right as rain
Rough around the edges, walkin' all the ledges, going insane

You show up and put your spell on me
Mmm, the nerve

How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love

You show up and put your spell on me
What's it worth?

How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love

What are we gonna do?
What if we never run away?
We never have to run away
