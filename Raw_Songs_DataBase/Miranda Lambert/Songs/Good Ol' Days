Oh southern breeze
Knock me to my knees
I believe you're the only one who can

The religious and the rest
They've all tried their best
Well I guess somethings you just don't understand

Oh Lord when will the road run out
I'm on the roll but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why
But still I second guess my place
What I stand to lose for winning
To find the truth I'm willing
Start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days

Oh southern pine
Reaching for a sky
I'm convinced that I can fly beneath your shade

And it's all overdue
Spendin' time just me and you
Mmm, the pulpit and pew where I was saved

Oh Lord when will the road run out
I'm on a roll but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why
But still I second guess my place
What I stand to lose for winning
To find the truth I'm willing
Start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days
Yeah

Oh Lord when will the road run out
I'm on a roll but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why
But still I second guess my place
What I stand to lose for winning
To find the truth I'm willing
Start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days

Oh southern breeze
Knock me to my knees
I believe you're the only one who can
