When the moonlight hits the water
The reflection hits your eyes
I can't take it any longer
And this rope is pulling tight

Be my anchor, pull me under
In this river here tonight
'Cause I can't breathe when I'm with you
When I'm with you I can fly

When you give in there's a stillness
And a comfort you can find
When you give up there's salvation
In the sweetest suicide

Be my anchor, pull me under
In this river here tonight
'Cause I can't breathe when I'm with you
When I'm with you I can fly

Be my angel
Come and save me
Come and take me
To the other side
