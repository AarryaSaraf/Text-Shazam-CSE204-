Mirror, mirror on the saddle, hear my rhinestones rattle
Actin' up
Billy Bob Texas pickin' out new exes
Actin' up
If you really wanna want me, I'll be riding on my pony
Just a-singing "Mony Mony"
'Cause I'm, mmmm, I'm actin' up

Even Tiger Woods couldn't swing it this good
I'm actin' up
My McQueen Mustang, hundred dollars in the tank
Gas it up
I'm out in the Mojave, call me Ricky, call me Bobby
Call me hotter than wasabi
'Cause I'm, mmmm, I'm actin' up

I want a sunset ride, a velvet rodeo
A Colorado high, a California glow
I want to see the desert from a painted palomino
Senorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up

Looking for the lightning, when I find it then I rhyme it
Actin' up
Little lone star Elvis, gonna get a little selfish
Shackin' up
With my microphone money bought my own milk and honey
Got my own kind of country, kinda funky
Turn it up

I want a sunset ride, a velvet rodeo
A Colorado high, a California glow
I want to see the desert from a painted palomino
Senorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up

I got a heart on fire, boy, don't you want to hold it?
I'm a really good trip, don't you wanna go on it

I want a sunset ride, a velvet rodeo
A Colorado high, a California glow
I want to see the desert from a painted palomino
Senorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up

I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up
