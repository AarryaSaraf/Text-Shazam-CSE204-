Took a heartbreak off the coast of Maine
Came up short and I tried again
Then New York stole the heart right off my sleeve
Fell asleep with a broken wheel
And something kept me rolling still
Both eyes closed waiting for the American dream

Yeah, I'm runnin' just as fast as my heart can
Some call me a fool and some just call it restlessness
But I keep on runnin'
Changing tires and changing plans
I call it my pursuit of happiness

Found a song in Carolina
Left a tip at every diner
Always running late on Eastern time
Put a hundred in the offering plate
And wondered if those pearly gates
Would open if I found the perfect rhyme

Yeah, I'm runnin' just as fast as my heart can
Some call me a fool and some just call it restlessness
But I keep on runnin'
Changing tires and changing plans
I call it my pursuit of happiness

It's a stranger, it's a dollar, it's my name on a big marquee
It's a million miles away, and it's right in front of me

Yeah, I keep on runnin' just as fast as my heart can
Some call me a fool and some just call it restlessness
But I keep on runnin'
Changing tires and changing plans
I call it my pursuit of happiness

Yeah, it's all just my pursuit of happiness
