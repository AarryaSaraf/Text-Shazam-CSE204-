I'm like a locomotive
I don't run out of steam
I'm headed toward the reservoir
And I'm gonna need a drink

I ain't no Napa Valley
New York City seems okay
I'm a little bit more Tennessee
And there's whiskey in my veins

I'm sweet tea sippin'
On the front porch sittin'
While my hubby fries chicken
And I'm pickin' these strings

I've been down on my luck
But I ain't givin' up
And I totaled his truck
But he loves me just the same
Mmm, he gives me wings
Oh, he gives me wings

I ain't no grand piano
I play a little out of tune
I spent all of my glory days
In a Honky Tonk saloon

Now I'm sweet tea sippin'
On the front porch sittin'
While my hubby fries chicken
And I'm pickin' these strings

I've been down on my luck
But I ain't givin' up
Got a heart like a truck
I'm a hummingbird ready to sing

Mmm, he gives me wings
Oh, he gives me wings

I'm sweet tea sippin'
On the front porch sittin'
While my hubby fries chicken
And I'm pickin' these strings

I've been down on my luck
Got a heart like a truck
So I ain't giving up
I'm a hummingbird ready to sing

Mmm, he gives me wings
Oh, he gives me wings
Oh, he gives me wings
Mmm, he gives me wings
