Sometimes these wings
Get a little heavy
I can't stay between the lines but I'm rocking steady
When I can't fly, I start to fall
But I've got wheels
I'm rolling on

I can't count time
I can't count money
But I've been counting every mile for a month on sunday
Whatever road, however long
I've got wheels
I'm rolling on

Sometimes these wings
Get a little heavy
And I can't stay between the lines but I'm rocking steady
When I can't fly, I start to fall
But I've got wheels
I'm rolling on

And when I find a place to rest
I'll stay just long enough to catch my breath
This life with you will keep me strong
Damn these wheels
I'm rolling on

Sometimes these wings
Get a little heavy
And I can't stay between the lines but I'm rocking steady
When I can't fly, I start to fall
But I've got wheels
I'm rolling on

I've got wheels
I've got wheels
I've got wheels
I've got wheels
I've got wheels
I've got wheels
