Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
Come lay down on my pillow
'Til the dawn comes breaking through
Am I crazy, I don't know
And you just might be, too
Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you

These truck stop bars are lonely
These highways, they don't quit
You might be my one and only
If we keep meeting like this

Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
Come lay down on my pillow
'Til the dawn comes breaking through
Am I crazy, I don't know
You just might be, too
Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you

It's too late to stop drinking
Too early to go home
There's a flashing vacancy sign
Just across the road

Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
Come lay down on my pillow
'Til the dawn comes breaking through
Am I crazy, I don't know
You just might be, too
Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you

My ring is on my key chain
Your diamond's in your purse
It won't feel like cheating
If nobody gets hurt

Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
Come lay down on my pillow
'Til the dawn comes breaking through
Am I crazy, I don't know
You just might be, too
Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
