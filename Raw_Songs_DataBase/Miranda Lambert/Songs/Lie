They say I'm there perfect girl
The kind you take to mama the kind you cant ignore
Did ya laugh it off and just sell her crazy
& I find your datin some girl named stacey
When will this dream come to life

Oh, when ya tell me that you want me 
Tell me that you need me baby
Cause I been sittin here waitin, waitin for you to come save me
Tell me does it feel right under this porch light, look me in the eye
Tell me that you want me even if ya have to even if ya have to lie

I guess I'll give up on fairytales 
Take back all my pennies from that wishing well
Oh, why cant we be Will and Kate? 
I know that we could be that great

When will you see us through my eyes
Oh, maybe tonight
You'll tell me that you want me 
Tell me that you need me baby
Cause I been sitting here waiting 
Waiting for you to come save me
Tell me that it feels right under this porch light
Look me in the eye
Tell me that you want me even if ya have to,
Even if you have to lie

Oh the truth is I don't want the truth
I just wanna be with you so baby believe me this is what we need
This is what I need 

So tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me baby yeah
Cause I been sittin here waitin 
Waitin for you to come save me
Tell me that it feels right under this porch light
Look me in the eye
Tell me that you want me even if ya have to 
Even if ya have to lie
Lieee
