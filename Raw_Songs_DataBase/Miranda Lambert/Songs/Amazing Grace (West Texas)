Out in West Texas it hardly ever rains
When it does its Amazing Grace
You can hear the cattle from a million miles away
To a cowboy's heart it's Amazing Grace

And the church bells ring in the little bitty towns
And the people come from miles and miles around
Just to hear that old piano feed their faith
With the word of God and Amazing Grace

Watching the sunset, drinking whiskey and lemonade
When it falls, it's Amazing Grace
She looks like an angel with the moonlight on her face
When she smiles it's Amazing Grace

And the church bells ring in the little bitty towns
And the people come from miles and miles around
Just to hear that old piano feed their faith
With the Word of God and Amazing Grace

And the church bells ring in the little bitty towns
And the people come from miles and miles around
Just to hear that old piano feed their faith
With the Word of God and Amazing Grace

Out in West Texas it hardly ever rains
But when it does it's Amazing Grace
