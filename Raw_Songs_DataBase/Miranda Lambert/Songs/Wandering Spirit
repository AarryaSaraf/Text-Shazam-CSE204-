When all twelve of the Apostles try to ring me on the phone
Take a message but I won't return their call
For I have no eyes to see him and I thought I lost my way
And I know I've lost the keys to the door

And I climbed the highest mountain and I looked down at the sea
And I saw a ship a-sailing to the shore
I took a passage to the East and then I journeyed to the West
And I made love from Battambang to Baltimore

And I said, oh, am I running in a race?
I said, oh, am I getting anyplace?
And I said, oh, can I make it?

I'm a wandering spirit
Wandering spirit, yeah
Wandering spirit
And I'm a restless soul

I was a glutton at the banquet and I spilt the finest wine
Trod the pyramids and ruins of Angkor
And I kissed the Mona Lisa and had breakfast with the king
And I touched the nerves of nature in the raw

And I said, oh, am I running in a race?
I said, oh, am I getting anyplace?
And I said, oh, can I make it?

I'm a wandering spirit
Wandering spirit, yeah
Wandering spirit
And I've no place to call my own

I said, oh, am I running in a race?
And I said, oh, am I getting anyplace?
And I said, oh, can I make it?
I can't make it

I'm a wandering spirit
Wandering spirit, yeah
I'm a wandering spirit
Wandering spirit, yeah
I'm a wandering spirit
Wandering spirit, yeah
Wandering spirit
Yeah, and I've no place to call my home
