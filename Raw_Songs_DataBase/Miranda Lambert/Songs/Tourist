I'm sunny-side and over easy
Hundred miles from Alameda
Stopping by and taking in the view
Just pickin' up a souvenir
Swap a story, share a beer
Feel the itch that makes me wanna move

'Cause there's always been a stranger in my soul
Who loves a good goodbye and a good hello

I'm just a tourist
I don't know where I belong, it might sound foolish
Yeah, but nowhere feels like home
So I roam from town to town
Taking snapshots of the world
And I laugh away the lonely
And give a local bar a whirl
And I wanna see it all so I keep movin'
I'm just a tourist

I'm the guitar case and a denim jacket
If I don't need it I don't pack it
Mama always told me, "Travel light"
I'm better on the interstate
I'll hitch a ride or take a train
Always one more postcard I can write

I guess Hohenwald is my hometown for now
I'll sit a spell but I won't hang around

'Cause I'm just a tourist
I don't know where I belong, it might sound foolish
Yeah, but nowhere feels like home
So I roam from town to town
Taking snapshots of the world
And I laugh away the lonely
And give the local bar a whirl
And I wanna see it all so I keep movin'
I'm just a tourist

I'll take a couple memories but I won't stay behind
I'll never be a number on a population sign

'Cause I'm just a tourist
I don't know where I belong, it might sound foolish
Yeah, but nowhere feels like home
So I roam from town to town
Taking snapshots of the world
And I laugh away the lonely
And give a local bar a whirl
And I wanna see it all so I keep movin'
I'm just a tourist
I'm just a tourist

Mighty nice to meet ya
See you when I see ya
