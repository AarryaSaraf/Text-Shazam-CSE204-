If you ever get time to two-step down to Texas
Find yourself down 'round Austin way
I'll be waiting every time with my cowboy hat and wine
If you two-step down to Texas and go steppin' out with me

Take you down to the Broken Spoke and we'll dance the night away
'Round and 'round we'll go for broke 'til the Lone Star light of day
Honey, if we get the blues we'll look for Stevie Ray
If we fall Asleep at the Wheel, well baby that's okay

If you ever get time to two-step down to Texas
Find yourself down 'round Austin way
I'll be waiting every time with my cowboy hat and wine
If you two-step down to Texas and go steppin' out with me

Mosey down to the Continental or the Carousel
Catch last call for alcohol at the old Lone Star Motel
Migas at the old Magnolia, then we'll drive a spell
And do shady things in Dripping Springs, honey I don't kiss and tell

If you ever get time to two-step down to Texas
Find yourself down 'round Austin way
I'll be waiting every time with my cowboy hat and wine
If you two-step down to Texas and go steppin' out with me

Well, if you ever get time to two-step down to Texas
Find yourself down 'round Austin way
I'll be waiting every time with my cowboy hat and wine
If you two-step down to Texas and go steppin' out with me
If you two-step down to Texas and go steppin' out with me

Bye, Y'all
