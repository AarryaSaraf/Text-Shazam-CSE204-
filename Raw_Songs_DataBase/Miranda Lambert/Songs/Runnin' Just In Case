There's trouble where I'm going, but I'm gonna go there anyway
I hate Sunday mornings cause they always seem to start this way

I'm looking for a lighter, I already bought the cigarettes
Guess I picked me up a habit on my way out of Lafayette

Eastbound and down
I turn it up cause thats sure how I feel

My mind is racing through the pines
My hands are shaky on the steering wheel

I'm going north on 59, but I know good and well I'm heading south
Cause me and Birmingham don't have a history of working out

What I lost in Louisiana
I found back in Alabama
But nobody ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm runnin' just in case

I ain't unpacked my suitcase since the day that I turned 21
It's been a long ten years since then, It's getting kind of cumbersome

The first one, and the last one, and the one thats got my name in ink
The smoker, and the fighter, and the one in every song I sing

What I lost in Lubbock Texas
I look for in all the rest
But I guess no one ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm runnin' just in case

I carry them around with me, I don't mind having scars
Happiness ain't prison, but there's freedom in a broken heart
