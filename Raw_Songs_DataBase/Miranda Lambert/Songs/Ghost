I burned your Levi's and your pearl snap shirts
Ashes to ashes and dirt to dirt
Buried our love in a deep dark hole
Now you're just a ghost

If you're such a poet, write an epitaph
You and I both know you ain't coming back
I sure loved you but I let you go
Now you're just a ghost
Honey, now you're just a ghost

My spirit's high, so don't you hang around
Silver-tongued devil, you can't hold me down
Silly boy, only heaven knows
That I ain't afraid of ghosts

I replaced the headboard with a chiseled stone
Here lies the meanest man I've ever known
Go rest in peace with every lie you ever told
'Cause now you're just a ghost
Honey, now you're just a ghost

My spirit's high, so don't you hang around
Silver tongued devil, you can't hold me down
Silly boy, even heaven knows
That I ain't afraid of ghosts

I've got 10, 000 angels here to pull me through
I've cried the last tear that I'll cry for you
You're just a shell of a man that I used to hold
Now you're just a ghost
Honey, now you're just a ghost
And I ain't afraid of ghosts
