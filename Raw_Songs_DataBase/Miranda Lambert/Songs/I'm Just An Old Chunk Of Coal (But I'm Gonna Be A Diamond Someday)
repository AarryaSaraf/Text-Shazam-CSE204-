Hey, I'm just an old chunk of coal
But I'm gonna be a diamond someday
I'm gon' grow and glow till I'm so blue, pure, perfect
And put a smile on everybody's face
I'm gonna kneel and pray every day
Lest I should become vain along the way
I'm just an old chunk of coal, oh, Lord
But I'm a-gonna be a diamond some day

I'm gonna learn the very best way to walk
I'm gonna search and find a better way to talk
And I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
Till I get rid of every single flaw
I'm gonna be the world's best friend
I'm gonna go around shaking everybody's hand
Hey, I'm gonna be the cotton pickin' rage of the age
And I'm a-gonna be a diamond some day
Alright

Now I'm just an old chunk of coal
Ooh, and I'm gonna be a diamond some day
I'm gon' grow and glow till I'm so blue, pure, perfect
I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
I'm a-gonna kneel and pray every day
Lest I should become vain along the way
Hey, I'm just an old chunk of coal, oh, Lord
And I'm gonna be a diamond some day

Yeah, I'm gonna be the cotton picking' rage of the age
Yeah, I'm a-gonna be a diamond some day
Here we go
