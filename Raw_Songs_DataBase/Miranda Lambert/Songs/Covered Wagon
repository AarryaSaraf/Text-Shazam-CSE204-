Get that lead out momma
Pack up everything we own
Smog's about to get me
And I've got a mind to roam
In my covered wagon
Honey down the road we go
On down the road we
On down the road we go

Got an itch to ramble
And I got no place to be
The people in the city
They ain't got no use for me
In my covered wagon
Momma down the road we go
On down the road we go
On down the road we go
Alright

Baby down the road we go
On down the road we go
On down the road we go

I'm headed for the country
Can't nothing keep me here
I feel so free and easy
Like a funky pioneer

In my covered wagon
Imma down the road we go
On down the road we go
In my covered wagon
Baby on down the road we go
On down the road we go
Down the road we go
On down the road we go
Baby down the road we go
On down the road we go
Baby down the road we go
On down the road we go
Honey down the road we go

Down the road I go
Down the road I go
Down the road I go
On down the road we go
Down the road I go
On down the road we go
Thats right
