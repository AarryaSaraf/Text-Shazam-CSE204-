Pick a switch, read the bible.
Hunt fish for survival.
Plant a seed, watch it grow.
Learn to trust which way the wind blows.
Let your mama know you love her, you will never have another.

Daddy, I have not forgotten lessons learned under the light of a southern, starry sky.
Family's the light that guides us, blessed be the ties that bind us.
Sweet by and by, sweet by and by.

Tell the truth, earn your dollar.
Let not your heart asunder.
Save yourself, believe in faith.
Good things come to those who wait.
Let your daddy know you love him, you will never have another.

Mama, I have not forgotten lessons learned under the light of a southern, starry sky.
Family's the light that guides us, blessed be the ties that bind us.
Sweet by and by, sweet by and by.

Daddy, I have not forgotten lessons learned under the light of a southern, starry sky.
Mama, I have not forgotten lessons learned under the light of a southern, starry sky.
Sweet by and by, sweet by and by.
