If your life is like a tornado
You've been living in black and white
All you need is a smoke and a rainbow
Honey, let me give you a light
Alright
Let me give you a light

Yes queen, go queen
Dip it like a Dairy Queen
Put your inhibitions in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies?
Out in the country honey, y'all means all
Y'all means all
Mmm, y'all means all
Hey

Maybe there's a little scratch in your reflection
Maybe your rhinestone lost its shine
Just count on love and count your blessings
Count on me, come on let's ride
Mmm
I got a big ol' bus so jump on and ride

Yes queen, go queen
Dip it like a dairy queen
Put your inhibitions in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies?
Out in the country honey, y'all means all
Y'all means all

You can be born in Tyler, TX
Raised with the Bible Belt
If you're torn between the why's and exes
You ain't gotta play with the hand you're dealt

Yes queen, go queen
Dip it like a Dairy Queen
Put your inhibitions in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies?
Out in the country honey, y'all means all
Honey, y'all means all

Yes queen, go queen
Dip it like a Dairy Queen
Put your inhibitions in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies?
Out in the country honey, y'all means all
Honey, y'all means all
Honey, y'all means all
Hey
