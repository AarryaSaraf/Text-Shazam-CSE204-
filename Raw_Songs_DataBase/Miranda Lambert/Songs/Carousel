Pretty Elaina
My fair lady
She walked the high wire back in the 80's
Feathers and sequins
She shined like a chandelier
Hanging from the top tent rafters
Till the spotlight disappeared

Harlan Giovanni
What a sight to see
The way he earned her trust was on a 20-foot trapeze
She fell so hard because he always let her fly
Till he left her heart suspended
In a cotton candy sky
She still don't know why

Every show must end
Every circus leaves town
You don't know the magic's gone
Until the lights go down
Now she's back in Nacogdoches
And I hear she's doing well
She only misses Harlan when she hears a carousel

Pretty Elaina
Made herself a nest
Her sequins and her secrets
Buried in her cedar chest
No one around here knows about her other life
Johnny Davis went and made her a mama and a wife
And maybe that's alright

'Cause every show must end
Every circus leaves town
You don't know the magic's gone
Until the lights go down
Now she's back in Nacogdoches
And I hear she's doing well
She only misses Harlan when she hears a carousel

Smith County Fair
Mid-September
She walks the midway
And smiles when she remembers

Every show must end
Every circus leaves town
I didn't know the magic left
Till all the lights went down
Now I'm back in Nacogdoches
And I swear I'm doing well
I only miss my Harlan when I hear a carousel
I only miss my Harlan when I hear a carousel
