We'll smoke like a couple in the 1960s
Lit up like a pair of Woodstock hippies
Looking down on a town where it don't seem wrong
To be a bonfire blaze where it don't belong

Meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
Don't let me wait
I wanna start up this flame
Meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
When the building's burning
Baby, we're to blame

Downtown bar bands bouncing off the brick walls
Half pint lovers rolling out with their last calls
The street lights down on Lafayette
Ain't seen nothing like you and me yet

Oh, meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
Don't let me wait
I wanna start up this flame
Meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
When the building's burning
Baby, we're to blame
Baby, we're to blame

We'll smoke like a couple in the 1960s
Up all night like New York City

Oh, meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
Don't let me wait
I wanna start up this flame
Meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
When the building's burning
Baby, we're to blame
