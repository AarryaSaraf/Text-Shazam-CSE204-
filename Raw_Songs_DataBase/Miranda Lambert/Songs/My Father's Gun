From this day on, I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down, below the southern land
What I'd do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
Wear the color of the grey's and join the fight again
I will not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die, I'll wear my father's gun

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well that's just fine, alright
'Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men
(Oh, woah)
Slip us a rope and sail around the bend

As soon as this is over, we'll go home
Plant the seeds of justice in our bones
We'll watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter there when the bells of freedom ring

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well that's just fine, alright
'Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men
(Oh, woah)
Slip us a rope and sail around the bend
Oh, I'd like to know where the riverboat, riverboat sails tonight
I'd like to know where the riverboat, riverboat sails tonight
Mmm, I'd like to know where the riverboat, riverboat sails tonight
'Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men
(Oh, woah)
Slip us a rope and sail around the bend
