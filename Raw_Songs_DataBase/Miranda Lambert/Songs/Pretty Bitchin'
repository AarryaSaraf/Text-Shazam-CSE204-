I got a pretty new truck
Had some pretty good luck
And some pretty red wine I'm sippin'
Got a pretty guitar
With a white pickguard
And a pretty good song if you're listenin'
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

Got a pretty Airstream rollin' down the road
You oughta see the pretty white walls spinnin'
Pretty pink carpet on the floor
No lock on the door
Help yourself to the Tito's in the pretty kitchen
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

I use what I got
I don't let it go to waste
I'm pretty from the back
Kinda pretty in the face
I hate to admit it
But it didn't stop me, did it

Yeah, life's pretty weird, life's pretty great
Life's pretty good if you live it
1, 2, 3 Mississippi
Sitting pretty damn pretty
On this pretty life I've been given
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

Well, I'm a pretty hot mess
But hell, I guess
I'm pretty sure it's a family tradition
I got a pretty good time in the checkout line
With all the free press I've been gettin'
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

'Cause I use what I got
I don't let it go to waste
I'm pretty from the back
Kinda pretty in the face
I hate to admit it
But it didn't stop me, did it

Yeah, life's pretty weird, life's pretty great
Life's pretty good if you live it
1, 2, 3 Mississippi
Sitting pretty damn pretty
On this pretty life I've been given
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

I've had pretty good day
I'm in a pretty good place
I'd say pretty much I'm winnin'
I gotta pretty good band
Pretty damn good fans
And this pretty good life I'm livin'
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'
