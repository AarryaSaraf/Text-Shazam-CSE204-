I don't remember when the liquor started kicking in
It's been awhile since I've been off the stuff

I really hate to say I'm turning into a cliche
I'm hoping that nobody brings it up

I left my car behind the bar again last Sunday night
I did the Monday morning drive of shame

In last nights clothes they smell like smoke
But I don't know how I got home
But I do know my head will hurt all day

But I'm still going to stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeo's and Juliet's have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on

Well everybody's got a spark
It's easy hiding in the dark
In a crowded room with pockets full of rings

I sit and watch the whiskey pour
The married men, the exit door
The beginning of another matchbook flame

And I don't try to justify the reason I'm not livin' right
I wear my sadness like a souvenir

I drink too much to fall apart
That's how I fight this broken heart
So what, if I feel comfortable in here

But I'm still going to stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeo's and Juliet's have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on

Hey!
