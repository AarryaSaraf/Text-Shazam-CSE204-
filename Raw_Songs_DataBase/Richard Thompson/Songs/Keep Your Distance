If I cross your path again
Who knows where, who knows when
On some morning without number, on some highway without end
Don't grasp my hand and say
"Fate has brought you here today"
Oh, fate is only fooling with us, friend

Keep your distance, oh, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me, what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, keep your distance
Ah with us it must be all or none at all

It's a desperate game we play
Throw our souls, our lives, away
Wounds that can't be mended and debts that can't be paid
Oh, I played and I got stung
Now I'm biting back my tongue
I'm sweeping out the footprints where I strayed

Keep your distance, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, oh, keep your distance
With us it must be all or none at all

Keep your distance, oh keep your distance
When I feel you close to me what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, oh, keep your distance
With us it must be all or none at all
With us it must be all or none at all
With us it must be all or none at all
