When I am laid, am laid in earth, may my wrongs create
No trouble, no trouble in thy breast
When I am laid, am laid in earth, may my wrongs create
No trouble, no trouble in, in thy breast
Remember me, remember me, but ah!
Forget my fate
Remember me, but ah!
Forget my fate
Remember me, remember me, but ah!
Forget my fate
Remember me, ah!
Forget my fate
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, mmm, mmm
