Tell me why have my loved ones gone
Like dew 'neath the early sun?
Why am I left all alone
While all their troubles here are gone?
My days of youth have passed away
And the shades of life are near
But still I remain to mourn the happy days
Where dear departed friends were here

Tell me why have my loved ones gone?
Gone to return no more
Calmly gliding o'er a summer sea
While I'm left plodding on the shore?

Tell me why have my loved ones gone
While springtime is on the breeze?
Gilding the hillside farm
And breathing music through the trees
The birds are singing in the air
And the flowers are in their bloom
All things around are beautiful and fair
But still my spirit lies in gloom

Tell me why have my loved ones gone?
Gone to return no more
Calmly gliding o'er a summer sea
While I'm left plodding on the shore?
Why have my loved ones gone?
Gone to return no more
Calmly gliding o'er a summer sea
While I'm left plodding on the shore?

I've got a favorite version of this at home. A duet between Hoagy Carmichael and Louis Armstrong which is about as good as it gets.
