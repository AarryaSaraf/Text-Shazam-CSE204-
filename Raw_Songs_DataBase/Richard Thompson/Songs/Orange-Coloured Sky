I was walking along minding my business
When out of an orange-colored sky
Flash, crash, alakazam
Wonderful you walked by

I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange-colored view
Flash, crash, alakazam
I got a look at you

One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
This is it, this is it, this is it
I've been hit!

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, crash, alakazam
Out of an orange-colored sky

One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
This is it, this is it, this is it
I've been hit!

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, crash, alakazam
Out of an orange-colored, candy-striped
Fruity green polka-dot sky
Flash, crash, alakazam
And goodbye

I never knew love was so loud when it's really disturbing noise
