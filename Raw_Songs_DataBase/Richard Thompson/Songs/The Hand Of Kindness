Well I wove the rope and I picked the spot
Well I struck out my neck and I tightened the knot
O, stranger stranger, I'm near out of time
You stretch out your hand, I stretch out mine

O maybe just a hand of kindness
Maybe just a hand of kindness
Maybe just a hand
Stranger, will you reach me in time? In time?

Well, I scuppered the ship and I bent the rail
Well, I cut the brakes and I ripped the sail
And they called me a Jonah, it's a sin I survived
And you stretch out your hand, I stretch out mine

Maybe just a hand of kindness
Well, maybe just a hand of kindness
O maybe just a hand
Stranger, will you reach me in time? In time?

O shoot that old horse and break in the new
O the hung are many and the living are few
I see your intention, there's my neck on the line
You stretch out your hand, I stretch out mine

Well, maybe just a hand of kindness
O maybe just a hand of kindness
Well, maybe just a hand
Stranger, will you reach me in time? In time?

O maybe just the hand of kindness
Well, maybe just the hand of kindness
Well, maybe just a hand
Stranger will you reach me in time? In time?
