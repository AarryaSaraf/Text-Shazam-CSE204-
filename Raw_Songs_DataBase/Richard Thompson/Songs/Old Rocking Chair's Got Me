Old rockin' chair's got me
Cane by my side
Fetch me that gin, son
'Fore I tan your hide
I can't leave this cabin
I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm sittin' here grabbin'
Flies 'round this rockin' chair
Oh sweet aunt Harriet
How long in Heaven you be?
Send out a sweet chariot
For an end of the troubles I've seen
Old rockin' chair's got it
Ain't goin' nowhere
Trapped in my rockin' chair

Oh sweet aunt Harriet
How long in Heaven you be?
Send out a sweet chariot
For an end of the troubles I've seen
Mmm, old rockin' chair's got me
I'm goin' nowhere
Trapped in my rockin' chair
Trapped in my rockin' chair
