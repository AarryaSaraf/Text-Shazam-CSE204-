In Sunnyvista all your dreams are reality
It's the smart place to be
For all the family
Oh Sunnyvista, where you always wanted to stay
We'll dance the happy hours away

Now the work is very clean
You'll be helped by this machine
And the hours are very short
More time at home with the little dears
All the houses are the same
It's a standard we maintain
Any problems please report
And we will soon allay your fears

It's a smashing place for kids
You really are well rid
They'll be off your hands all day
In the camps they'll play and play
For kids of other ages
Yes, dad and granddad too
The leisure time facilities
Will keep them smiling through

In Sunnyvista all your dreams are reality
It's the smart place to be
For all the family
Oh Sunnyvista, where you always wanted to stay
We'll dance the happy hours away

Oh the old folks will love it
Our staff are very kind
There's community singing
Helps to stimulate the mind
The cemetery is most discreet
All done without a fuss
For all life's little grievances
Just leave it all to us

Oh there's parks and there's bingo
There's contests and there's games
And everybody's friendly
'Cause we're all just the same
There's chances for promotion
For the right kind of chap
Who's smart and keen and go ahead
We'll put him on the map

Oh Sunnyvista, where you always wanted to stay
We'll dance the happy hours away
We'll dance the happy hours away
