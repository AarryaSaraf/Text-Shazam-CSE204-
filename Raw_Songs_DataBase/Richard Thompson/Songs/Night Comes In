Night comes in like some cool river
How can there be, be another day?
Take my hand, oh, real companion
And we'll dance, we'll dance till we fade away

Oh, the songs pour down like silver
They can only, only break my heart
Drink the wine, the wine of lovers
Lovers tired of being apart

Dancing till my feet don't touch the ground
I lose my mind and dance forever
Lose my mind and dance forever
Turn my world around
Turn my world around

Oh, this night is like no other
And this room is ringing in my ears
And these friends will never leave me
And these tears are like no other tears

Dancing till my feet don't touch the ground
I lose my mind and dance forever
Lose my mind and dance forever
Turn my world around
Turn my world around

Well, I may find that street tomorrow
Leave the shadow of my lonely room
See my one, my one and only
Heart and soul, I'm coming soon
