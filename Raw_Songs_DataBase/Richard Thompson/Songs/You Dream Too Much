She came down the stairs in her cocktail dress
She fell on her food like a lioness
There was ringing in my ears like an SOS

She said, you dream too much
If you think I've a thing for you
You dream too much and it's going to end bad

The boom box was sounding sweet
We were dancing to a jungle beat
Just when our lips were about to meet

She said, you dream too much
Who's that girl in your dreams with you
You dream too much and it's going to end bad

You'll stumble going through life the way that you do
I hope I'm somewhere else the day that you do
The way that you do...

She had a chassis like an XJS
Skull necklace just like a high priestess
I thought maybe just one caress

She said you dream too much
You're dreaming now while I'm talking to you
You dream too much and it's going to end bad, oh it's going to end bad

All my life I've been like this
I start thinking of the perfect kiss
Velvet dream on an iron fist

She said, you dream too much
Even this isn't really true
You dream too much and it's going to end bad...
