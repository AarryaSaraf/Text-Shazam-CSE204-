Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Away you rollin' river
Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Away, I must away
Across the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Away, you rollin' river
Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Away, I must away
Across the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I took a notion
Away you rollin' river
Oh Shenandoah, to cross the ocean
Away, I must away
Across the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I'm bound to leave you
Away you rollin' river
Oh Shenandoah, I'll not deceive you
Away, I must away
Across the wide Missouri

Thank you
