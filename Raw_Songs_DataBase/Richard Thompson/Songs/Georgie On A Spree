Me Mammy told me "Isabel, now don't stay out too late
One day they'll throw you out of school, so get yourself a steady date"
But Georgie meets me every night we go out and we have a bite
Eyes of blue, and money too, he's rattling the garden gate
And I can hardly wait

When Georgie's on a spree all the girls are jealous of me
'Cause I'm the one he spends his money on, we spend it one, two, three
Driving in his Chevrolet I'm perfect company
He's the king and I'm his queen when Georgie's on a spree

We don't see bad company, we mix it with the best
Rubbing shoulders with the rich and no time for the rest
When I see something that I need my Georgie buys the street for me
And when we're tired of the Ritz he's got a little nest
Where I put him to the test

When Georgie's on a spree all the girls are jealous of me
'Cause I'm the one he spends his money on, we spend it one, two, three
Driving in his Chevrolet I'm perfect company
He's the king and I'm his queen when Georgie's on a spree

One day Georgie hung his head and sadly he did say
"Little girl, I'm leaving you, I have to go away
But I'll be back in a week or two and I'll be thinking just of you
Sit beside your telephone until that lucky day
When I come home to stay"

When Georgie's on a spree all the girls are jealous of me
'Cause I'm the one he spends his money on, we spend it one, two, three
Driving in his Chevrolet I'm perfect company
He's the king and I'm his queen when Georgie's on a spree
