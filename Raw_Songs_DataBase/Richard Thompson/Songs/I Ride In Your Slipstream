I ride in your slipstream
I wear your reflection
I echo your heartbeat
In the wind

You might say we're lovers
You might say we're strangers
You think you don't know me
But you're wearing my ring

Good road, bad road
Just don't mean a thing
Good dream, bad dream
Just don't mean a thing
Down in the while of the wheels
You'll hear me sing

I'm like a TV eye in the sky but I'm right behind you
I'm like your signed confession but I'm right behind you
I'm like the child you never were but I'm right behind you
Let's ride

I ride in your slipstream
But don't try to touch me
Just trust me to love you
I love you

I ride in your slipstream
I ride in your slipstream
I ride in your slipstream
