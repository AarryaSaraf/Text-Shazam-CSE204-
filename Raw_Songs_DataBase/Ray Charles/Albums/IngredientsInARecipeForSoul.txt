// Busted //

My bills are all due and the baby needs shoes and I'm busted 
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound, but I'm busted 
I got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay 
A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day 
The county's gonna haul my belongings away cause I'm busted. 

I went to my brother to ask for a loan cause I was busted 
I hate to beg like a dog without his bone, but I'm busted 
My brother said there ain't a thing I can do, 
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu, 
And I was just thinking about calling on you 'cause I'm busted. 

Well, I am no thief, but a man can go wrong when he's busted 
The food that we canned last summer is gone and I'm busted 
The fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow, 
Me and my family got to pack up and go, 
But I'll make a living, just where I don't know cause I'm busted. 

I'm broke, no bread, I mean like nothing, It's over

// Where Can I Go? //

Tell me, where can I go?
There's no place I can see.
Where to go, where to go?
Every door is closed to me.
To the left, to the right,
It's the same in every land.
There is nowhere to go
And it's me who should know,
Won't you please understand?
Now I know where to go,
Where my folk proudly stand.
Let me go, let me go
To that precious promised land.
No more left no more right.
Lift your head and see the light.
I am proud, can't you see,
For at last I am free:
No more wandering for me.

// Born To Be Blue //

When there's a yellow moon above me
They say there's moonbeams I should view
But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold
'Cause I was born to be blue

When I met you the world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel, oh well

I guess I'm luckier than some folks
I've known the thrill of lovin' you, lovin' you
And that alone is more than I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue

When I met you the world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel, oh well

I guess I'm luckier than some folks
I've known the thrill of lovin' you, lovin' you
And that alone is more than I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue

// That Lucky Old Sun //

Up in the mornin'
Out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day.
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining, tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

[Instrumental Interlude - First Line Of "Dear Lord"]

Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

// Ol' Man River //

Here we all work 'long the Mississippi
Here we all work while the white folk play
Pullin' them boats
From the dawn till sunset
Gettin' no rest till the judgment day

Don't look up and don't look down
You
Don't das make the boss man frown
Bend your knees and bow your head
And pull that rope until your
Dead

Let me go 'way from the Mississippi 
Let me go 'way from the white man boss
Show me that stream
Called the River Jordan
That's the old stream that I long to cross.

Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River

He don't say nothin', but he must know somethin'
He just keeps rollin', he keeps on rollin' along

He
Don't plant tatters, and he don't plant cotton
And them what plants em, are soon forgotten
But Ol'
Man River, just keeps rollin' along

You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all achin' and racked with
Pain
Tote that barge and lift that bail
You get a little drunk and you lands in jail

I gets weary,
And sick of trying
I'm tired of livin', but I'm scared of dyin'
But Ol' Man River, he just keeps

// In The Evening (When The Sun Goes Down) //

In the evenin', in the evenin', Mama when the sun go down
In the evenin', darlin', I declare when the sun go down
Yeah, it's so lonesome, it's so lonesome, sometimes
I declare when the one you love is not around
When the sun go down

Last night, I were layin' sleepin'
I declare, I was sleepin' all by myself
Last night, I were layin' sleepin', darlin'
And I declare it was all by myself
Yeah but the one that I was really in love with
I declare she was sleepin' some place else
When the sun go down

Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh
And I just, suddenly I wanted baby
Everybody could have a good time before me
When the sun go down

The sun rises in the east
And I declare it sets way over in the west
Sun rises in the east, darlin'
And I declare it sets way over in the west
Yes it's so hard, it's so hard to tell
I declare which one that'll treat you the best
When the sun go down

So goodbye, old sweethearts and pals
Yes I declare I'm goin' away
I may be back to see you again
Little girl some old rainy day
Yes in the evenin', in the evenin'
I declare when the sun go down
When the sun go down

// A Stranger In Town //

There's A New Kid In Town
We're looking for the king, the new Messiah
We're following the star shining brighter.
"Old man, won't you help us if you can,"
He shook his head but he pointed his hand.

There's a new kid in town,
And he's lying in a manger down the road.
There's a new kid in town,
But he's just another baby I suppose,
Heaven knows,
There's a new kid in town,
Here in Bethlehem.

I see you've traveled far bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for the new King's pleasures
I've heard that a king might come
But up till now there hasn't been one.

There's a new kid in town,
And he's lying in a manger down the road.
There's a new kid in town,
But he's just another baby I suppose,
Heaven knows,
There's a new kid in town,
Here in Bethlehem.

There's a new kid in town,
And he's lying in a manger down the road.
There's a new kid in town,
But he's just another baby I suppose,
Heaven knows,
There's a new kid in town,
Here in Bethlehem.
