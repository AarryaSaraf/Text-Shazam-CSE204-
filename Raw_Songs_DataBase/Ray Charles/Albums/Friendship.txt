Album: Friendship

// Two Old Cats Like Us //

[Charles:] Hey, I like to do a little rockin'
[Williams:] Ray, I get a little rowdy myself
[Williams:] See if you can sing the high part, brother
[Charles:] Hank, I can if you give me some help

[Both:]
'Cause we're the kind when we set our minds
We're gonna do it or bust
Hey, we ain't half bad for two old cats like us

[Williams:] There ain't nothin' like honky tonk music
[Charles:] Now
[Williams:] When you get an itching to play

[Charles:] And singing those songs like 'Hey, Good Lookin'
[Charles:] And 'Baby, Tell Me What I Say'
[Williams:] That'll work

[Both:]
We can take it to the limit
Or take it back to the bus
Ain't no problem for two old cats like us

We've been down a whole lot of alleys
Shook a whole lot of cans
Ain't too much about prowlin' or howlin'
That we don't understand
Had a few doors slammed on our tails
We've been kicked and cussed
But everything's cool for two old cats like us

[Williams:] Play a little

[Williams:] Now this younger generation, Ray
[Williams:] Is keepin' us on our toes
[Charles:] That's right
[Charles:] Playing everything from western swing
[Charles:] To that good ol' rock and roll

[Both:]
And here we are smack dab in the middle
But I think we can adjust
Hell, there ain't nothing new for two old cats like us

[Williams:] Tell the truth, now

[Both:]
We've been down a whole lot of alleys
Shook a whole lot of cans
There ain't too much about prowlin' or howlin'
That we don't understand
Had a few doors slammed on our tails
We've been kicked and cussed
But everything's cool for two old cats like us
But everything's cool for two old cats like us

[Williams:] Let's go prowlin'
[Charles:] Alright

// This Old Heart (Is Gonna Rise Again) //

Look down on me if you want to, ooh baby
You can count me out, don't count long
I've lost my taste for love before
It goes away, but it don't stay gone
I feel it in my bones, my bones

This old heart, this old heart
This old heart, this old heart

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again

Well, I cried till I'm all out of teardrops
And I hurt till I'm all out of pain
Then I wait for the first love that comes down the track
Like a hobo waiting for a train, oh

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again

You may wonder just what keeps me going
It's the true love that waits down the line
I know that heartbreak is one more behind me
And true love is getting closer all the time

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again

// We Didn't See A Thing //

Well I swear, I didn't see you with your wife's best girlfriend
Drinkin' beer and a dancin' to that western swing
And I didn't see you kiss her and leave that barroom with her
No I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing

George, I know I didn't hear you tell that blonde that you weren't married, no
I know I didn't see you hidin' your weddin' ring either did I?
And I know I couldn't have heard you call your wife
And tell her that you were working
No, no I didn't see you, I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing

We've got to stick together to keep our stories straight
Now don't forget Ray I was down in Atlanta
Sure you were and I was workin' late
Yeah you know it's always good to see you
George it's good to see you too, yeah
But I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing

Hey Ray by the way do you leave that hundred bucks you owe me
I don't know what you're talkin' about George
Well I'm sure you recall our bet on last night's football game
No I don't but you know if I had seen you, I certainly would've paid ya
But I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing

We've got to stick together to keep our stories straight
Don't forget I was down in Atlanta
And don't you forget I was working late
Oh you know it's always good to see you
George it's good to see you too
But I, I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing

// Who Cares //

Well, your old girlfriend told me your new lover left you
But you're too proud to tell ol' you know who
J., you don't have time to work me in your busy schedule
But I know you're only busy bein' sad and blue

So who cares (who cares) if you're feelin' lonely?
Who cares (who cares) if you're sad and blue?
Who cares (who cares) if you got no one to love you?
Well, who cares? I do, that's who

Well, I heard you were lonely, so I wanted to call you
I thought you'd say that I'm the one you missed
But when you picked up the phone, you pretended not to know me
When I told you I still love you, you replied, Who's this? that's right

Well, who cares (who cares) if you're feelin' lonely?
Who cares (who cares) if you're sad and blue?
Who cares (who cares) if you got no one to love you?
Well, who cares? I do, that's who

Well, you haven't called me up in a whole month of Sundays
So I went out and I found somebody new
You're lying on me, honey
'Cause I got too much pride to spend my life waitin' on your phone call
Now he was gone and I'm alone, but I'm not missin' you

So who cares (who cares) if you're feelin' lonely?
Who cares (who cares) if you're sad and blue?
Who cares (who cares) if you got no one to love you?
Well, who cares? I do, that's who
Yeah, who cares? I do, that's who

// Rock And Roll Shoes //

It seems like yesterday
I heard the people say
Son, you were born to stray
Someday you'll settle down

I guess there'll come a time
Maybe I'll tow the line
But right now I'm doing fine
Rolling from town to town

I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

Guitars and ringing tones
In my blood and in my bones
Show me a bus and I'll call it home
'Cause I don't wanna change

On a lonely day
When they put me in my grave
Ain't a worry you need to save
Just hang up my rock and roll shoes

I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

So let that motor run
Headed out towards the sun
I'm in the mood for moving on
But I'll be back someday

I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

Hang up my rock and roll shoes, Ray
Hang up my rock and roll shoes, yeah
Hang up my rock and roll shoes, I'm gonna
Hang up my rock and roll shoes, let me
Hang up my rock and roll shoes, B.J.
Hang up my rock and roll shoes, why don't you
Hang up my rock and roll shoes, Ray
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

// Friendship //

If you're ever in a jam, here I am
And if you're ever in a mess, S.O.S
And if you ever feel so happy
You land in jail. I'm your bail

It's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships are soon forgot
Ours will still be hot

If you're ever up a tree, just phone to me
If you ever loose your teeth when you're out to dine, borrow mine

It's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships are soon forgot
Ours will still be great

If they ever black you're eyes, put me wise
Well, if they ever cook your goose, then turn me loose
And if they ever put a bullet through your brain, I'll complain

It's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships are soon forgot
Ours will still be it

If you're ever down a well, ring my bell
If you ever loose your mind, I'll be kind
And if you ever loose your shirt, I'll be hurt
If you're ever in a mill and get sawed in half, I won't laugh

It's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships are are up the crick, ours will still be slick

// It Ain't Gonna Worry My Mind //

It's the same old story that they all hand me
The preacher tells me these are troubled times
But I know the Lord's been in tougher scrapes then this one
Ain't gonna worry, ain't gonna worry
Ain't gonna worry my mind

Got no money in the pocket
You don't get rich working overtime
But as long as you can't buy the springtime in Virginia
I ain't gonna worry, no I ain't gonna worry
Ain't gonna worry my mind

Love is all that ever makes you richer
Oh well, if the truth be told
Moonlight's been my only silver
And the sunlight's my only gold, mm hmm

So go on wishin', go on prayin'
Go on sayin' I'll hit better times
How in the world could you love me any better?
Ain't gonna worry
I tell ya I ain't gonna worry no, no more
Ain't gonna worry my mind

// Little Hotel Room //

A one man celebration ain't what I had in mind
As I sit here sippin' on a glass of wine
There's a working telephone beside my bed
The way the calls are coming in, you'd think the line was dead

Oh, there's no place like home
And it's lonesome in this little hotel room

The plaster on the ceiling just about to fall
There's a picture hanging crooked on the wall
The music on the radio plays on
For a moment there, I thought they were playing our song

Oh, there's no place like home
And it's lonesome in this little hotel room

From the window I can see a falling star
I wonder if you see it where you are
And wouldn't it be something if it's true
That you would make the same wish that I do

Oh, there's no place like home
And it's lonesome in this little hotel room

// Crazy Old Soldier //

I've had fame and fortune
Women come knock on my door
I've lived to the limit
And maybe a little bit more

There are so many stories
Of how I got out of control
Some say it's a woman
Some say it's my troubled soul

I'm like a crazy old soldier
Fighting a war all my own
Just me and the whiskey
And the bottles are ten thousand strong

You'd think I'd give up
As many times I've been hit
But like a crazy old soldier
I just don't know when to quit

Barrooms and bedrooms
Are just faces and places and names
Once for the pleasure
And Lord knows, once for the pain

I've tried to forget her
And all of the things that we've done
But as long as there are memories
I'll never hang up my gun

I'm like a crazy old soldier
Fighting a war all my own
Just me and the whiskey
And the bottles are ten thousand strong

(Oh, sing ya) You'd think I'd give up
As many times I've been hit, never
But like a crazy old soldier
I just don't know when to quit

// Seven Spanish Angels //

He looked down into her brown eyes
And said, "Say a prayer for me."
She threw her arms around him,
Whispered, "God will keep us free."

They could hear the riders comin',
He said, "This is my last fight.
If they take me back to Texas,
They won't take me back alive."

There were seven Spanish angels at the altar of the sun.
They were prayin' for the lovers in the valley of the gun.

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the throne,
And seven Spanish angels took another angel home.

She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand.
She said, "Father, please forgive me;
I can't make it without my man."

And she knew the gun was empty,
And she knew she couldn't win,
But her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again.

There were seven Spanish angels at the altar of the sun.
They were prayin' for the lovers in the valley of the gun.

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the throne,
And seven Spanish angels took another angel home.

// Everybody Has The Blues //

Hey Ray, I feel so sad
I guess you think that no one ever felt so bad before

Everybody has the blues
Everybody has the blues
Everybody knows the way that you feel today
And I thought it was just me

Everybody gets to sit and cry
Everybody gets to wonder why
Everybody gets to watch the sky turn gray
And guess what, this may get surprising to you

Some people lose your job
Maybe you lost your girl
Maybe you feel like we're losing your minds
That's not the end of the world, hey

Everybody gets to feel some pain
Everyone got to get caught out in the rain
Everybody got some days that they can't explain

Play the blues, Ray
Alright, here I come

On Dallas, even JR gets the blues
Politicians get the blues
TV anchor people, they get the blues
Everybody, everybody has the blues

// Baby Grand //

Late at night when it's dark and cold
I reach out for someone to hold
When I'm blue, when I'm lonely
She comes through

She's the only one who can
My baby grand is all I need

In my time I've wandered everywhere
Around this world, she would always be there
Any day, any hour
All it takes

Is the power in my hands
This baby grand's been good to me
Alright?

(Alright)

I've had friends, oh, but they've slipped away
And I've had fame, but it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes, spent them fast enough
As for women

They don't last with just one man
But my baby grand is gonna stand by me

Oh, they say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
(What? I don't believe that)
They said melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these, played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on

I've come far from the life I strayed in
And I've got the scars from those dives I played in

Now I'm home and I'm weary
And in my bones

Every dreary one night stand
My baby grand is coming home with me, with me
Ever since this gig began
My baby grand's been good to me
