// I've Got News For You //

You said before me met
That your life was awful tame
Well, I took you to a night club
And the whole band knew your name. Oh,
Well, baby, baby, baby
I've Got News For You
Oh, somehow your story don't ring true,
Well, I've got news for you.
Well, you phoned me you'd be late
Cause you took the wrong express
And then you walked in smiling
With your lipstick all a mess
Oh, let me say to you little mama,
Wo, I've Got News for you
Ah, your story don't ring true lil girl
Yeah, I've got news for you.

[Instrumental - Subdominant Bridge]
[A Section Solo]

Oh, you wore a diamond watch,
Claimed it was from Uncle Joe.
When I looked at the inscription
It said love from Daddy-O.
Oh, well baby, wo lil girl, I wanna say
I've Got News For You.
Ah, if you think that jive will do
Let me tell you, oh,
I've Got News For You
Well, somehow your story don't ring true
Wo, I've Got News For You.

// One Mint Julep //

One early morning as I was walking
I met a woman, we started talking
I took her home to get a few nips
But all I had was a mint julep

I don't remember just how I started
I only know that we should have parted
I stole a kiss and then another
I didn't mean to take it further
One mint julep was the cause of it all

The lights were burning low, there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door up popped her father
He said, "I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter"
I didn't know just what I was doing, I had to marry or face ruin

A mint julep, a mint julep
A mint julep, a mint julep
One mint julep was the cause of it all

Now, I don't want to bore you with my troubles
But from now on I'll be thinking double
I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey
I got six extra children from a-getting frisky

A mint julep, a mint julep
A mint julep, a mint julep
One mint julep was the cause of it all

// I'm Gonna Move To The Outskirts Of Town //

I'm gonna move baby, way out on the outskirts of town
I'm gonna move baby, way out on the outskirts of town
You see I don't need no-body, always hangin' 'round
Let me tell you honey, we gonna move away from here
I don't need no iceman, I'm gonna, get you a Frigidaire
When we move, way out on the outskirts of town
Whoa, you see we won't need no-body, always hangin' 'round

[Keyboard Solo]

It may seem funny honey, funny as can be
If we have a dozen children, you know they AW-LL-all better look like me
When we move, way back 'a town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, we won't need no-body, always hanging around
We don't need nobody baby, AW-LL-always hanging 'round
Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round
