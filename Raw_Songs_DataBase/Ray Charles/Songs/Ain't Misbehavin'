No one to talk with
I'm by my self,
No one to walk with,
But I'm happy on the shelf

Ain't misbehavin' 
I'm savin' my love for you....

I know for certain the one that I love,
I'm through with flirtin' 
Its just you I'm thinkin of
Ain't misbehavin' I'm saving my love for you

I'm like Jack Horner 
Sittin in a corner
Don't go nowhere 
What do I care
Your kisses are worth waitin for

Baby believe me

I don't stay out late I don't care to go,
I'm home about 8 just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin 
I'm savin' my love for you

I'm like jack horner sittin in a corner
I don't go nowhere what do i care
Your kisses are worth waiting for
Baby believe me

I don't stay out late I don't care to go I'm home about 8 
Just me and my radio 

Ain't misbehavin' I'm saving my love for you
