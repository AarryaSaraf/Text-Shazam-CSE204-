Heaven help the boy who never had a home
Heaven help the girl who walks the streets alone
And Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall
Lord, won't you help us all

Mhm
Heaven help the Black man if he struggles one more day
(One more day)
Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away (Back away)
Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl
Oh, Heaven help us all

Heaven help us all (Heaven help us)
Heaven help us all, help us all (Oh, we need You, Jesus)
Heaven help us, Lord (Oh Lord), hear our call (Hear our call)
When we call (Oh, when we call, oh yeah)

Heaven help the boy who won't reach twenty-one
(You tell 'em, Ray)
And Heaven help the man who gave that child a gun
(Shame, shame)
And Heaven help the people with their backs against the wall
Lord, won't You help us all

Heaven help us all (Oh Lord)
Heaven help us all, help us all
Heaven help us, Lord (Oh Lord), hear our call (Hear our call)
When we call (When we call, oh, when we call)

We need You to help us all, ooh, ooh, ooh
I want everybody within the sound of my voice this evening to fall down on your knees and say a prayer, asking for His guidance, His grace, His mercy. You might wanna say, "Lord, oh, oh, Lord have mercy, oh. Now I lay me down before I go to sleep. In a troubled world, I pray the Lord, the Lord to keep. Keep hatred from the mighty, and the mighty from the small. Heaven help us all." Heaven help us

Heaven help us all (Oh, have mercy)
Heaven help us all, help us all (We need You, Jesus)
Heaven help us, Lord (Oh Lord), hear our call (Oh, won't ya)
When we call (Oh, won't you hear me when I call, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Heaven help us all
(Yes, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this thing)
Heaven help us all, help us all (Lord, won't you come by here)
Heaven help us, Lord (Oh Lord), hear our call (Oh, when we call)
When we call (We can't do without you)
Heaven help us all (Oh, ho, ho, ho)
Heaven help us all, help us all (Lord, would you come by here)
Heaven help us, Lord (Oh, won't ya), hear our call
(Oh, won't ya lead us)
When we call
