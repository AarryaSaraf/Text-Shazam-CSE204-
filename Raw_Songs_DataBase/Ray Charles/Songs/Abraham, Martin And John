Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?
Can you tell me where he's gone? Yeah, yeah
He freed a lotta people, but the good, they die young
'Cause I looked around one day and man was gone
What a shame, he was gone
Listen

Anybody here seen my old friend Martin?
Can you tell me where the man gone? Uh-huh, now, now, now
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I turned my head one day, the man was gone
Lord, he's gone

Didn't you love the things they stood for?
Didn't they try to find some good for you and me?
And we'll be free
Some day soon, it's gonna be one day

Has anybody here seen my old friend John?
Ooh, can you tell me where he's gone?
Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee
He freed a lotta people, hm, but it seems the good die young
'Cause I turned around one day and the man was gone
Just like that, he was gone

Didn't you love the things they stood for?
Didn't they try to find some good for you and me?
And we'll be free
Some day soon, it's gonna be one day

Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
Oh, oh, I thought I saw him walking, huh, up over the hill
With old man Abraham (Abraham)
And I believe I saw Martin (Martin)
And his brother, John
