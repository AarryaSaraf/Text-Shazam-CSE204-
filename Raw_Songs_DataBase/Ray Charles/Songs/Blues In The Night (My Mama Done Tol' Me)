My mama done told me
When I was in knee-pants
My mama done told me, "Son"
She said, "A woman'll sweet talk
And she'll give you the big eye
But when that sweet talking's done
A woman's a two-face
A worrisome thing to leave you to sing the blues
In the night"

Now the rain's a-falling, hear the train a-calling, hoo-ee
Hear that lonesome whistle blowing across the trestle, hoo-ee
Ah-hoo-ee, ah-hoo-ee, old clickety-clack
The echoing back the blues, yeah, in the night, mm-hmm

The evening breeze will start the trees to crying
And the moon will hide its light
When you get the blues in the night
Please, take my word
The mockingbird will sing the saddest kind of song
He knows things are wrong, and he's right

Well, from Natchez to Mobile
Oh, from Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
Hey, hey, I've been in some big towns
And I've heard me some big talk
But here is one thing I know
A woman's a two-face
She's a worrisome thing that'll leave you to sing the blues
In the night

Ooh-woo-woo, ooh-woo-woo
My mama was right
It just ain't nothing out there but the blues in the night
Well, Mama, well, Mama, you told the truth, you did
You see, I know 'cause
Well, I've been in some big towns, heard me some big talk
Woo-hoo, oh, here is one thing I know
I don't mean no harm but it's the truth, yeah, it is
Listen, a woman'll sweet talk, give you the big eye
Well, oh, ha, but when that sweet talk got done
Look here, I got to tell you
You see, she's a worrisome thing to leave you to sing the blues
Oh-ho, the blues, yeah, in the night
Oh-oh-oh, one more thing
She can make me tremble, she make me tremble something like this
Do it, band
Oh, Mama
Well, Mama, I know what you mean, yeah
I do
