Every Saturday night, y'all, 'bout sundown
Country people in wagons, they be coming from miles around
And they're drinking corn liquor from a Mason fruit jar
And old men keep plucking, plucking that bass string guitar

Good ol' pig feet and barbecue (Pig feet and barbecue)
Good ol' catfish and homemade brew
And I got me some butter beans and chitterlings too (Butter beans and chitterlings too)
Every Saturday night, y'all, y'all, y'all

Let me hear
Every Saturday night, I get in my sin
And as long as I'm able, I'm gon' the same thing again, y'all know that, don't you?
My head gets so bad, it's a doggone shame
Y'all know I be so tore down, I don't even know my name

Good ol' pig feet, y'all (Pig feet and barbecue)
Oh, good ol' catfish and homemade brew
I have me some butter beans and chitterlings too (Butter beans and chitterlings too)
Oh, every Saturday night

Wait a minute
Monday morning (Monday) is the day I plow (Hey, hey)
And then Tuesday (Tuesday), I gotta milk the cow, y'all know about that, don't you? (Hey, hey)
Whoa, Wednesday (Wednesday), I have to walk the dog (Hey, hey)
Then Thursday (Thursday), I gotta slop the hog, now I ain't ashamed (Hey, hey)
Oh, Friday (Friday), good Friday (Friday)
Girls, what's the sixth day of the week? (Friday) Oh, Friday (Friday)
Woo, Friday (Friday), when my work is done (Friday)
I realize I've got one more night before Saturday comes

Good ol' pig feet, y'all (Pig feet and barbecue)
Good ol' catfish and homemade brew
Nothing like Oklahoma chalk, is it, though
With butter beans and chitterlings too (Butter beans and chitterlings too)
Oh, every Saturday night

Standard meal, there's enough to go around
'Cause we be doing it
All night long
Come Sunday morning, I still be going strong
Yes, I do, come on
Yeah, and let yourself go
Every Saturday night
You know we gon' lock it down
Do it
Yeah, ain't nothing wrong with it
Get it, oh
