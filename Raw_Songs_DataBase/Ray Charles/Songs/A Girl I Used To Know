There's a picture that I carry
One we made sometime ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say, "Just someone I used to know"

Just someone I used to spend some time with
Just a flame that's lost its glow
I don't tell them, how many nights I cry without you
I say, "Just someone I used to know"

Just someone I used to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
But, I don't tell them, how lost I am without you
I say, "Just someone I used to know"
I say, "Just someone I used to know"
