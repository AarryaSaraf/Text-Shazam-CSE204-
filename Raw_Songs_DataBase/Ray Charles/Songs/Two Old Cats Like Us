 Hey, I like to do a little rockin'
 Ray, I get a little rowdy myself
 See if you can sing the high part, brother
 Hank, I can if you give me some help


'Cause we're the kind when we set our minds
We're gonna do it or bust
Hey, we ain't half bad for two old cats like us

 There ain't nothin' like honky tonk music
 Now
 When you get an itching to play

 And singing those songs like 'Hey, Good Lookin'
 And 'Baby, Tell Me What I Say'
 That'll work


We can take it to the limit
Or take it back to the bus
Ain't no problem for two old cats like us

We've been down a whole lot of alleys
Shook a whole lot of cans
Ain't too much about prowlin' or howlin'
That we don't understand
Had a few doors slammed on our tails
We've been kicked and cussed
But everything's cool for two old cats like us

 Play a little

 Now this younger generation, Ray
 Is keepin' us on our toes
 That's right
 Playing everything from western swing
 To that good ol' rock and roll


And here we are smack dab in the middle
But I think we can adjust
Hell, there ain't nothing new for two old cats like us

 Tell the truth, now


We've been down a whole lot of alleys
Shook a whole lot of cans
There ain't too much about prowlin' or howlin'
That we don't understand
Had a few doors slammed on our tails
We've been kicked and cussed
But everything's cool for two old cats like us
But everything's cool for two old cats like us

 Let's go prowlin'
 Alright
