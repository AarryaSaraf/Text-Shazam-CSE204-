(Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Two-stepping with the woman I
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Two-stepping with the woman I
Low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is)

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment

You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

Seeing through a picture behind a screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then we'll go all night

Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Love, love
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I, night
Night, yeah
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
And all we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words and weapons, and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark
And I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me

I feel like I've got nothing left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feeling like the best
And the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat

'Cause we're living life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays, and we'll go all night

Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Love, love
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I, night
Night, yeah
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Night, love
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Two-stepping with the woman, oh

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Love, love
Night, love
Two-stepping with the woman I
Two-stepping with the woman, oh

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Night
Two-stepping with the woman I
Low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I
All we need is us to go all night

All we need is us to go all night
