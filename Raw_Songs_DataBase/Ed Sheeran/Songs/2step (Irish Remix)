I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment

You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're living life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn
If we're missing out on what the people think is right

Seeing through a picture behind a screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays

And then we'll go all night

Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

Slow down when I can't feel myself
Looking right but knowing that there's nothing left
So slow wine for the sour grapes
'Cause moving on isn't up for debate

I still wonder where the time's gone (Am I wrong?)
Sometimes I don't wanna be strong (They alarm)
With all these expectations of what I should be
CC'd in so many threads that I can't see me

Even when I'm struggling
I bless my enemies so much they feel they owe me something
Shatter pains like ceilings, even when I barely function
It's wahala but mahalo
Got my two-step, so the beat's the only thing I have to follow, uh

We'll go all night

Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all (Night)

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
