// Beautiful People //

We are, we are, we are

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sun down and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're heading downtown
('Round here)

Everybody's looking for a come-up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation, here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become

Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful

(L.A., mm)

Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
(Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there
(All night)
I'm not fazed by all the lights and flashing cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

We don't fit in well
We are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become

Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (yeah)
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful

(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful

Something boring (Something boring)
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, ugh

Bust it open, rain forest, it be pouring

Drop an album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball (Ugh)

// Take Me Back To London //

Jet-plane, headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London

Yo, I do deals but I never get twanged
Moves that ain't ever been planned
Know goons that were never in gangs
Where I'm from chat shit get banged
Where I'm from chat shit, let the 12-gauge rip
Yeah, sick how it fits in my hand
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam
Or these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef a grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time-keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride, shoot a guy
Leave you wet like you scuba dive
You were younger then, and now we're unified
South London boys get you crucified
I'm gone

It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things
They just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time
Yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the divide tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back in the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London Town, right now

Jet-plane, headed up to the sky (to the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (woop woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (in a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle night, ceiling low (ceiling low)
Sweat brow dripping down when in Rome (when in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (they don't)
So take me back to London

Yo when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top-ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock 5970 daily
But I want soul
I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowing up my phone
And Ted said, "That's just the way things go"
It's just the way things go, amazing flows
Grime or rap, man, I give 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow and went global, man
Now the case is closed

2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years you'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
And when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto' (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

Jet-plane, headed up to the sky (to the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (in a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle night, ceiling low (ceiling low)
Sweat brow dripping down when in Rome (when in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (like my home)
So take me back to London
So take me back to London

// Best Part Of Me //

My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out
Of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure

My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight
Day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and I place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you, whoa
Lately everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
(With you)

Baby, the best part of me is you, whoa
Lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

Baby, I'm so in love with you, yeah, yeah
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

// I Don't Care //

[Ed Sheeran:]
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Can you take my hand?
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, ooh

[Justin Bieber:]
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Press your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm supposed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay

[Ed Sheeran (Justin Bieber):]
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, ooh (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, ooh (No)

[Justin Bieber:]
I don't like nobody but you, it's like you're the only one here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, I don't care

[Ed Sheeran:]
I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, yeah

[Ed Sheeran (Justin Bieber):]
'Cause I don't care (Don't care)
When I'm with my baby, yeah (Oh yeah)
All the bad things disappear (Disappear)
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody (Maybe I'm somebody)
I can deal with the bad nights (With the bad nights)
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near (Me near)
You can take me anywhere (Anywhere, anywhere)
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
(I'm loved by somebody, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

// Antisocial //

All you cool people, you better leave now 'cause it's about to happen

Friday night and I'm riding solo (Yeah)
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low (It's lit)
I don't mess with your energy (No)

No photos, so antisocial but I don't care
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though
Got my hat low, don't talk to me (Straight up)

I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easing my pain
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (Straight up)

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night

I need room, I need room, where you standing way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes when I zoom, when I zoom past
I wake up by myself right past noon, right past noon, then I'm doomed
(Hit the ground, I'm movin' through ya)

Hennessy's drowning all of my issues
Right before I leave she give me more than just a "Miss you" (Yeah)
That thing got more back just like my engine, I can't hit it (No more)
Seen a vision and oh boy did we commit (It's lit)

I've been lost out inner space
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (Straight up)

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night

(Don't touch me, yeah)

// Remember The Name //

[Ed Sheeran:]
Yeah I was born a misfit, grew up ten miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
Stick to singing, stop rapping like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just being on the rich list
Might be insanity but people call it gifted
My face is going numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in this song might get twisted
My wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy, and you know nothing about my business
And if I had my fifteen minutes, I must have missed 'em

Twenty years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you Remember The Name
And if you thought I was good well then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent "In Da Club"

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

[Eminem:]
Hey, hey, hey
I can still remember (What?)
Tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL, I climbed the Billboard charts
To the top until as fate would have it (Yeah)
Became an addict, funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time'll tell (What?) If I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) Put Nine Inch Nails (Where?)
In my eye-lids now (What?) I'm seeing diamond sales
Like I'm in Zales (Yeah) Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no if ands or butts, are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me, 'cause you're only fuckin' living in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my death bed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So, why would I quit? The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head, I said it, then forgot what I said

[Ed Sheeran and Eminem:]
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

[50 Cent:]
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You could find me in my whip rockin my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shining, wrist with the rocks on it
Buscemi's the locks on it
Everything my voice on, the shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit, and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch we be ballin' out, the king bringing 50 bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout the shit tomorrow
The turn up is so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow we hangin' over, 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

[Ed Sheeran and 50 Cent:]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

(Hey, hey, hey)

// Feels //

(Bada boom bada bing, you'll knock me right off of my feet)

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's something real
Something real
I got the feels, yeah (Bada boom bada bing, you'll knock me right off of my feet)
I've waited most my life for something real
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Drop it to the ground, leave your hand in the sky, baby
No head, no nothing, gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in a cloud, baby
Baby, I got that feeling
Don't know why you do this to me
I try to tell 'em not to do it, it's loud
I try to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap till we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the ride, bus
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's something real
Something real
I got the feels, yeah
I've waited most my life for something real
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Used to be playboy, heartbreaker
But for you, I travel 1,000 acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (Alright)
One day we get married in Las Vegas
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin
This love give you protein and vitamins
See you wiggling, jiggling
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon?
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothing like anything I ever really seen
You give me this feel if you know what I mean

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Bada boom bada bing, you'll knock me right off of my feet
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
I've waited most my life for something real
Baby, I got the feels for ya

// Put It All On Me //

Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul

I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me

All on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
All on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
All on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me

Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you that can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, yeah

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly (Hey)
My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need (Oh)
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me (Babe)

All on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey baby, we can dance slowly (Slow)
All on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
All on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need (Need)
So put it all on me

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

// Nothing On You //

I feel it
Can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I, I mean it
Don't you turn off the light
Oh, I don't wanna leave here ever, no

She was like, "Damn, boy, I never took you for a one-night stand"
So don't make plans for nothing but me and a little romance
Hey, you and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
Or keep them on, with nothing on, oh my my my

I was rollin' up something with you
Kickin' back in the way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringing my phone
But they ain't got nothin' on you
And you ain't got nothin' on you

Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó
Desde que salimos por la tarde los dos
A besarnos los dos hasta hacer el amor

Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacíamos los dos no se puede igualar
Parecemos ficción cuando entramos en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeah

Pero lo que mata
Es que esta noche nos vemos y en mi casa
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

I was rollin' up something with you
Kickin' back in the way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringing my phone
But they ain't got nothin' on you
And you ain't got nothin' on you

Look, take the lead follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Homegirl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
A flight in a spaceship, I got a Land Rover
Casa Cruz, Casablanca, Casanova
I'ma fashionista she in FashionNova
And her mad persona when I had her over
That outfit it cost bread I got the matchin' loafers
Why? Cah that's somethin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothing on you, no

I was rollin' up something with you
Kickin' back in the way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringing my phone
But they ain't got nothin' on you
You ain't got nothin' on you

She was like, "Damn, boy, I never took you for a one-night stand"
She was like, "Damn, boy, I never took you for a one-night stand"
Want to be your man, boy I never took for a one night stand
She was like damn and you ain't got nothin' on you

// I Don't Want Your Money //

Ayy, I waited for you all day

I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time

I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home (Yeah)
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I want all of your love, your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I just want your, I just want your time)

You know you're my baby (You know you're my baby)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy
Why you gotta mess with my mind?
You know you're my baby (You know you're, oh)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy, you know, you know

I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Yeah, I want, yeah, I want your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Time, time)

And I love, and I love, and I love you
Yeah, I love, and I love, and I love you
And I love, and I love, and I love you
But I want your time, yeah
Want your time, time

// 1000 Nights //

I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on
Puttin' up fifty thousand lights
I've been gone so long, getting up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights

This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch, look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touch down
Everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose
I be like, "What now?"
I started making moves
They showing me love now
Lit like a light bulb, 'cause bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda pop and
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold the rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now I walk in the stadium, tell 'em, play my shit
And they gon' sing it like this

Well, I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on
Puttin' up fifty thousand lights
I've been gone so long, getting up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights

Last night I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but what does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember damn, me and my man inside of a Sprinter van
Two hundred a night until 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was out there couchin' with friends
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
Two pound pint, the waitress made me leave my number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo!)
And I don't think it's gonna be stopping any time soon
Birds eye view, paid my dues for a two mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Let me invite you to my world

I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on
Puttin' up fifty thousand lights
I've been gone so long, getting up and gettin' faded (Gettin' faded)
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights

I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up just like the reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make it seem often
Saint Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green on fleek
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran, just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe you know she be flee, ah yeah
Everyday I be seein' her in Celine, ah yeah
She wanna come closer but I don't see her still
I'm not a regular person, I be low key, ah yeah

From New York out to London, she was, she was with me all the time
And I been on the road so long, she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

Well, I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day
Playin' on, playin' on
Puttin' up fifty thousand lights
I've been gone so long, getting up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights

// Way To Break My Heart //

Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinking 'bout her

And her lips upon mine, so soft
Feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love
Oh why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason or have you found someone else?

So tell me, girl
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the mornin' comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my

First love never dies
Guess I'll see you in another life
Twelve years down the line
There's just one thing I remember

Her lips upon mine, so soft
Feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love
Oh why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason or have you found someone else?

So tell me, girl
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the mornin' comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my

That's the
That's the
That's the
Did I, did I
That's the
That's the

That's the way to break my
