// You Break Me //

Well my friend it seems we've come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you

'Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you're too cold
And she said 'I can put away all those lies
And show you there's no surprise in me'

Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that's what's going on

'Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

You break me

// I'm Glad I'm Not You //

It's been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left me
All that's left is shattered hearts
It's plain enough for us to see that
You've got me
You've got me

We're just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It's no fuss
I'm not in love

Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You've got me
You've got me

We're just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It's no fuss
I'm not in love

I lost it in your kiss, your lips,
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer's touch
It's true
I'm glad I'm not you

// You Need To Cut Your Hair //

Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I'm a bad influence, that'll do
'Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just don't talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don't be slow
This'll only take a mo'
Take yourself right out of my door

It's just that they don't care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don't reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don't give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl's trouble

Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
'Cos you're a bad influence, that'll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just don't talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don't be slow
This'll only take a mo'
Take yourself right out of my door

It's just that they don't care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don't reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don't give in to lust
And leave that one alone

This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever, either
Dance as you're a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you don't see
Fell the weight, gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2D
The only thing that's free in life is love
And that don't come cheap

It's just that they don't care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don't reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don't give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl's trouble

// Sara //

Sara, what you do to me is enlighten my mind
Oh wow, I said
Sara, what you do to me is make my soul unwind

Hey now
'Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood
So I thought I'd write a song for you

And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that

Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow, I said
Sara, you say that you don't look good when you do
Even with that soul

Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood
So I thought I'd write a song for you

And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that

May I say, you look great
May I play this to make your day

// Move On //

Now it seems I've been young, dug my hole in the ground
To me there's only up, there ain't no point in looking down
However hard I try, I only get weaker
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold

What you gotta do is never get yourself down
Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground
Keep out of trouble, ain't no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now

Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it

When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived
And as the mist clears, homie I arise
From my tomb in disguise
I'm all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move
Now back up!

Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it

All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who â€¦what the fuck does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder
It don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?

// Yellow Pages //

I felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I can't forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See, I was wrong on how I hate you
And it's the worst thing that I did

When I read through you
You weren't translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I'd be free from it

See, all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on I'm back in my mood
See, I got drunk and said I loved you
And it's the worst thing that I did

When I read through you
You weren't translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I'd be free from it

// Smile //

Just give me a pen and I'll write my worries
Now and again I'll try and not see that you don't care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life's bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don't care

And hey, I don't speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile

They've written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don't care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don't care

And hey, I don't speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile

// Postcards //

Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I'm so frustrated, so dilated
And she's telling me I've wasted my time
And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat

Still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we're asking for so much more
Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor

Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I'm so frustrated, so dilated
And she's telling me I've wasted my time
And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, 'cos I won't mind
I doubt if I even know that I'm awake

And still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we're asking for so much more
Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor

// Two Blokes And A Double Bass //

Sing the song Celestial Man
Shake the thing your mother gave ya!
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
I'd wager that you're gonna take it
Make you fight nature, born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark, put on the light
And he said 'You and your big cheeks have got me'
Along with 'Disarm' and 'Flooded Quarry'
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black
You make the room's hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain't wrong
He's got me singing to 'Amerikan Folk Song'
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Don't talk, only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom
JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand
This ain't no fake, it's music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout 'Wow!'
How did they even have the guts to do it ?
If your name's Nizlopi, then there ain't much to it
'Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around now

// The West Coast Of Clare //

Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there

I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I'd find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again

In Milltown there's a pub
It's there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I'll banish lonesome thoughts
But they'll return again

I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I'll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog

Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there

// I Can't Spell //

I found the words to say how I feel
But I just can't spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That I'm a different man with a different tune
I didn't find love until last June
But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
'Cos I need something, anything to replace you
Or something close

// You Break Me 2 //

Well my friend it seems we've come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you

'Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you're too cold
And she said 'I can put away all those lies
And show you there's no surprise in me'

Well still
'Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that's what's going on

'Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

You break me
