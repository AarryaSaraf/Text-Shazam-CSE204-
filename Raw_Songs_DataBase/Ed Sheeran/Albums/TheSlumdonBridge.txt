// London Bridge //

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
There wasn't much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last cheque
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette
Feeling half dead, whisky on my mind
Then came the dead
Sherrif in the yard, here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye
Baby in her arms
She took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave
Nonchalant about it
Maybe she'll come back
This time I doubt it
Act like I care, but I really don't
Wanted to change
But somehow I knew I really won't
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand
God's not going to land another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock and be late again
One gun and a harley in the driveway
One way out, dirt road, pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk, half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention
In fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away
And he started singing...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I didn't see it coming
I didn't see the wall
And I went from running, to a slow crawl
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie
I speak no evil, but hear no angels
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door
Knock knock
I'm on the salt road non stop
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot
And the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap
I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven, Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge
But I can't forget the sound

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

[Verse 3/Outro: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
[x4]

And we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
[x2]

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down

// You Don't Know (For Fuck's Sake) //

[Yelawolf:]
For fuck's sake, yeah
Yelawolf, Melody Man

[Ed Sheeran:]
Living the life of a student, yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind and they say that I've been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight and never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad with a ten in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
'Cause I've hidden my pride, giving the time
To write rhymes but I find truth at a quarter to five
Hey

[Yelawolf:]
It's kinda like I took a train to the left side of my brain, oh, mayne
Puddles of mud, under my love, you know I'm stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology, psychologically insane
Pardon me while I get down, down, down
Making you get up and say

[Ed Sheeran:]
If you don't know
If you don't know by now, you better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him 'bout? Yeah
Yeah

[Yelawolf:]
Ten toes to the dirt, pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink, drink a pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels, I'm a ridah, steel ring, no Prada
Only thrift clothes and my ada-di-das
I'm a fetus in my room, say na na
Daddy's home, on the mic, hey papa

[Ed Sheeran:]
Back with a bang yo, straight loop pedal, no band though
But every single one of my fans know
That every damn show I'm taking their ears on a journey
Like I'm flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin' so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics 'cause they think I've been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes, rocking a Kangol
I'm riding 'round with Yelawolf in your daddy's Lambo

[Yelawolf:]
Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You're probably sipping sweet tea still, huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
That what you used to steal from
You been playing fools like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game when you know the meal's done
Yelawolf is gettin' back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still, son, woah
This old rock, the hill's been rolled
Still shocking when I see 'em go
Bananas, when they handle this animalistic flow

[Ed Sheeran:]
If you don't know
If you don't know by now, you better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him 'bout? Yeah
Yeah

[Yelawolf:]
I'm not the average half-a-wit after this hour gets out of this
60 seconds, I'm goin' any direction and
Chasing this Jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
Is probably the better idea, yeah, you move when the direction in
Fact, it's a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blow on this fucking mic like a wind 'til college start again
Hooligans, hooligans rule again but really who's a friend?
Jump in this lake of fire, jump right back in the pool again
Knew I'd be new again, a student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers, I'm tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4, minus war, you don't want it
Shady Records, I'm already better, fuck it, doggonnit
Dog don't gotta lead, dog's already home, Jack
Dogg I'm a beast, I'm a wolf, bring your dogs back (Woof !)
A melody-man and a melancholy mellow-yellow can
Shhhh, tell 'em how we gonna sell 'em man

[Ed Sheeran & {Yelawolf}:]
Been working hard all week
{So if you wonder if we earned it, well it's not a probably}
So won't you bring that back to me
{And holler when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween}
I got blisters on my feet
{To walk at night with you, is not the shoes to be borrowing}
So won't you bring that back to me
'{Cause all the soul of my pen is only what all the sorrow brings
If you don't know}

[Ed Sheeran:]
You don't know, if you don't know, if you don't know (no, no, no, no)
If you don't know, if you don't know, if you don't know (no, no, no)
If you don't know, if you don't know, if you don't know (no, no, no, no)
If you don't know, if you don't know, if you don't know (no, no)

// Faces //

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Faces change
But this place'll stay the same
And I'll know
When I'll go

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yeah
And I'm pickin' up another bag
And I pack another knapsack
The airport's like a stop light to me
Sittin' on red, green light go
Can't see my family
My family grew into a global trance
Or fans, some may call 'em
And it's on the stage I stand
To jam Roxy, no wakin' up to stop the dream
I lived the life, signed a picture
'Cuz no dam could stop the stream
Or flood gates, I'm in the fuck trades
And a pocket fulla culture condoms
They put you on the podium for first place
But on the block, they judge you on 'em
So
Who got the South in a six pack, and a shotgun just for show?
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth
Put the hood in mossy oak
I'm the
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's write
With a broken pen, there they go again
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin jam
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin in
I'm goin home, I'm home again
Bring it back up in the UK
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack
Catfish Billy, hell, you say
I'm just bein' blunt, homie
Keep the grass

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Yeah, take one look
Better yet, take two
But if I take that break, there's a move you made
This dude you shape will come take you back
Back to the roots I've been
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in
Or a spot to sleep in
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season
Cuz I am not the reason
That the image you're used to seein'
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless
Meaning yes, I'm different
Differently made
And me screamin' the A
Is not the difference in grades
It's the place I stayed
Cuz the schools were underpaid
The teachers taught, but to me they fought
A star that was underway
It was under Wayne, it was in my name
Michael
M.W.A
Atha
And in trouble I stayed
Breakin out of this bubble they made
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand
Committed to the words I say
A blood line's not a family tree
It's a needle in my skin for all to see
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk
But I drink and take the ink

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly

// Tone //

[Yelawolf:]
Yeah, Slumdon Bridge
Mr. Red, Catfish
Back me up
Let's go

I'm out to bark again, ball cracked on the target, demolish it
Don't jump, I just see, nah, took a swattin', then
Think while I jump back on the beat, like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech, needs to retrieve blood
Should I creep into these ambient sounds with the speech? Obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's several pauses
You might need a coffin with holes on the top of these tubes to receive oxygen
You buried alive like a freak, six feet
Clawing and snatching and clawin' like a cat
And a dog and a rat
And a hog in a pen
With a frog and all there is to eat
Is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth and jaws and then
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of them
See that you back to bars again, he's all asleep in coffin, man
I'm all, they all that's been, ever was at the start of it
You mention the squad and then
You mention the god of pens
Not of it, but I'm harder then
Flesh I'm harder than titanium brass plates that are polished in
Sticking emcees off like a fly trap, or a bobby pin
When I rap I'm astonishing
I attack tracks like a train track strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave's that's what I made, got this bastard popping then
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shih tzus
Pisses on igloos
Throw it up to the whole fucking world, it's sick too
Vomitin' stomach fluid like you just ate shit stew
Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?
Neither does little Johnny give a shit if he sniffs glue
Or Beethoven care of you like his hair or the stick used
To orchestrate or does a porpoise hate when you dip through
Swimming in this ocean no, he just moves
What I'm trying to say is, it's my motherfucking ocean
And I crossed it
Built a bridge, the Slumdon Bridge, holla!
