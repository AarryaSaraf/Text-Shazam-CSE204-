Did you notice?
Did you find mistakes I made?
The times I tried, did you realize?
To let you go from me
The miles of things we've had
A thousand times
That you don't understand my, understand me
What the hell am I doin' here?
What the hell am I waitin' for?
Why did I take more than I can bear?
Don't you feel? Never holdin' on
'Cause you still wasn't worth it
What the hell are we doin' here?
What the hell are you waitin' for?
Where'd you call? Are you with my friends?
No distant love

Oh, hi, I found, I found somebody else, someone else
Why you have to be in love with somebody else? Oh
Oh, hi, I found, I found somebody else, someone else
Why you have to be in love with somebody else? How?


Love like rock, paper, scissors, willin' to cut you off
And if I ain't fall in love with you, I wouldn't fuck you soft (Yeah, yeah)
Me and her fightin' through the days, it throw my focus off (Yeah, yeah)
The media treat me like I ain't The Voice and I'm below the blogs
Life's too dangerous at twenty-two, I can't ignore her calls
I called her a "bitch" the other day, she say she no one's dog (I'm sorry)
She say she a stay-at-home mom, that's the perfect job
And I ain't gon' lie to the world, she workin' hard (Hard)
Like how you fall in love with somebody else? (How you fall in love?)
And if I even like a picture, I be on somebody's couch (Yeah)
Somebody's bed, somebody's house (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Instead of fixin' her hair, you was kickin' me out (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, but I'm different (But I'm different)
How you mad I'm from the trenches? (Oh, oh)
And I don't care about bitches (Oh, oh)
Allah, my witness (Oh, oh)


Oh, hi, I found, I found somebody else, someone else (How you in love?)
Why you have to be in love with somebody else? Oh
Oh, hi, I found, I found {somebody else}, someone else (Someone else)
Why you have to be in love with {somebody else?} How?


Can somebody please tell me
How you fall in love with somebody else?
Somebody else, somebody else, somebody else
Oh
