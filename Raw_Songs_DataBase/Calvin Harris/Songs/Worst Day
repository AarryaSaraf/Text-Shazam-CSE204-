Must be the worst day of my life
Izza Kizza, girl


My first mistake was letting you into my life
Yes, it was
My second mistake was allowing you into my bed
Laying in my bed
My third mistake was loving you more than I should
Though I really should know better
My fourth mistake was sitting with you
While you're telling me that you can't do this anymore

This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

I'm walking home and listening to MP3s
Just how did I let you decide to destroy me?
I'm missing you, it crossed my mind that a heart will bleed
The love that I have left behind is gonna finish me
It's one of those days


This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
('Cause it's the worst day of my life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
(Girl, Izza Kizza)
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side


See, yesterday, I called her back
The day before, I called her flat
It ain't working, break my neck
Still, it ain't cut me my cheque
A week ago, I did my thing
Three o' clock, I missed my train
Tomorrow, I thought we could chill
There won't be us, you won't, I will
The moral of the story like I told my cousin Corey
You see, Cupid, he will stab you in the back like Jason Voorhees
So he's got smoking me cigarettes and got me drinkin' 40s
And the doctor said, "Take two of these
And call me in the morning"
It's the worst day


This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side


Yeah, writing's on the wall
Got no heart, no soul, no control


This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
My life
