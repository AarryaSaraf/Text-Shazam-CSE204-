Busta Bust
Is they ready?
Yeah
It's only right y'all get on board this global express
And after we go around the globe, let's take this shit beyond the galaxy

Bang, everybody, if you step up in the party
And we do it, are you ready or not?
Flyin' like a rocket, ain't nobody else can stop it
I'll be movin', are you ready or not?
Watch the way we kill 'em and you know we gonna get 'em
And hit 'em then, are you ready or not?
Tell me if you're ready or not
Show me if you're really ready or not

Please be clear, I ain't never, never, never gonna stop
You better be careful, 'cause every single time you'll see me drop
I'm comin' to get 'em and celebrate it, cop another yacht
Be fuckin' shit up, is you wit' me? (Let's go)
You know I got it for ya 'cause you need that
I make 'em scream a line until you hear a lot of feedback
And then I hit the block until the shit is off the meat rack
Funny, Calvin, they want you to bring the beat back (Let's go)
Look, you don't really wanna do it (Heh-eh)
Go against me never, I be flowin' like a fluid
And I be damagin' everything every time when I really get up on it
It's nothin' we know, and they already knew it
And it ain't nothin' really to it 'cause we 'bout to let it blow (Blow)
Fireworks, people, now we givin' 'em a show
Never chill, gotta know a lot of money on the flo'
If it ain't nothin' else, you gotta let 'em know, are you ready or not?

Bang, everybody, if you step up in the party
And we do it, are you ready or not?
Flyin' like a rocket, ain't nobody else can stop it
I'll be movin', are you ready or not?
Watch the way we kill 'em and you know we gonna get 'em
And hit 'em then, are you ready or not?
Tell me if you're ready or not
Show me if you're really ready or not

Step up in the spot like another block
Every time I drop, stop, they ain't even got a clue (Clue)
Regularly trust I really need to be seen (Seen)
Medically tell me what you really wanna do
Generally, others think they better than me, boo (Boo)
'Til they try to squeeze they little foot up in my shoe
That's when I make 'em panic, I don't really understand it (Eh-eh)
That's when I lay 'em down and try to get a better view (View)
Genuinely see the way I regularly chew (Chew)
Wack all 'em bitch, I'm from the legendary few (Few)
Some are frumpin', I don't know if they already knew (Uh)
Instead of tryna front, you need to get a better crew (Uh huh)
Lactose, bitch, I keep a MAC close
Better know I pack toast, I don't wanna let it go (Ooh)
Damn folks, now they wanna stand close
Every time I bang, those cannons and they blow, are you ready or not?

Bang, everybody, if you step up in the party
And we do it, are you ready or not?
Flyin' like a rocket, ain't nobody else can stop it
I'll be movin', are you ready or not?
Watch the way we kill 'em and you know we gonna get 'em
And hit 'em then, are you ready or not?
Tell me if you're ready or not
Show me if you're really ready or not
