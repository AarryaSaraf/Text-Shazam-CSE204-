I don't really care if your tears fall down your face
You know you play the victim every time
I know you gettin' turned every night, oh yeah
Your girls ain't shit, tryna get me off your mind
The same ones who be hittin' up my line
They're not your friends

I need you to know that
We ain't ever gonna go back
This time, it got so bad
It's best for me, it's best for you
I need you to know that
Tried to love you, but I forced that
All signs, we ignored that
And it's not the same

'Cause it's over now, oh yeah
Don't get too confused, girl, it's over now, oh yeah, uh
No comin' back around, baby
Nothin' left to lose, girl, it's over now (Oh yeah, yeah)

So, I take this just to forget you
I don't regret those memories
And I swear I'm not tryna test
I wish you the best with the life you lead
But you always need that attention
Feedin' the press, when we don't speak
But we're both with somebody else
So please stop callin' me

I need you to know that (Oh girl)
We ain't ever gonna go back (Oh girl)
This time, it got so bad
It's not the same

'Cause it's over now, oh yeah
Don't get too confused, girl, it's over now, oh yeah, uh
(Stop callin', stop callin')
No comin' back around, baby (Oh, no comin' back around)
Nothin' left to lose, girl, it's over now (Oh yeah, yeah, said)

Na, na, na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na, no, whoa (Yeah, yeah)
I said, na-na, na, na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na-na (Hey)

'Cause it's over now, oh yeah (Stop callin' me, oh)
Don't get too confused, girl, it's over now, oh yeah, uh (Stop callin' me, hey)
No comin' back around, baby (No comin' back around, no, no)
Nothin' left to lose, girl, it's over now (Stop callin' me, yeah)
Oh yeah, uh, yeah

Stop callin' me back around, back around
Oh yeah
Ooh
Oh, girl
(Please stop comin' back)
Oh yeah
Stop callin', stop callin'
Ooh
