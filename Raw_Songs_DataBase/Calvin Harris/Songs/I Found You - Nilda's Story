I cannot say what I'm feeling
If I don't know how to move
I cannot say what I believe in
I finally believe in you
I've traveled many roads
And I know what road to choose
Now my world is never changing
If there's anything I can do

'Cause I found you
'Cause I found you
'Cause I found you
Yeah, I found you

I cannot say what I'm feeling
If I don't know how to move
I cannot say what I believe in
I finally believe in you
I've traveled many roads
And I know what road to choose
Now my world is never changing
If there's anything I can do

'Cause I found you
'Cause I found you
'Cause I found you
Yeah, I found you
And I found you
And I found you
And I found you
'Cause I found you, yeah
Ooh, you, you

'Cause I found you
'Cause I found you
'Cause I found you
Yeah, I found you
And I found you
And I found you
And I found you, yeah
'Cause I found you
