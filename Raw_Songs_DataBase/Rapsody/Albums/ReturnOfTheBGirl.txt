Album: ReturnOfTheBGirl

// The Intro //

[9thMatic aka 9th Wonder:]
Uh, yea, Rapsody
Return of the B-Girl
It go, light it up like a Molotov
Sparkle in the dark, starting at the start mark
Ready, set, go running out the block hard
The block hard, tre-four, word to my mom
Tre time is the charm, if the luck is on
So what the fuck, gwon, do what you want
9thMatic, attack it, uh, so whatcha gonna? Nothing
Live nigga for real, it's the return of the b-girl, Rap Diddy for real
Rap Diddy for real, it's the return of the b-girl, Rap Diddy for real
Rap Diddy for real, it's the return of the b-girl, Rap Diddy for real
Rap Diddy for real

[Rapsody:]
Yea, grand return like Jordan '98
No bull, I calculate that I'll be one of the greats
Like [?] Ricky, cause I talk slicky like snake
Claim you dope, but like Nicole Richie you holdin' no weight
Unless you Ricky, Drake, Jay or Andre or Kanye
Slim picking, guess you lucked up on my come up you see
Cause I'm on it free, Willy the whale, T.I., Wayne post-jail
I'm nice, where most can't even rightly spell
Polite well, oh hell XXL
Tryna cover pages in your next XXL
Cause I'm next, what, you've waited three years?
I've been waiting 27, can't explain my tears
A joy like Pete Rock and Jay and Kanye
In Brightlady doing all-nights, calling home, my mate
For change, [?] gassing me up
Make change like 2 quarters, 5 dimes to a buck
To progress, low stress like west side, side
L.A. Dodgers dodging me, my flip side [?]
Carolina rise, mom and pops watched me struggle lots
Couldn't read me like CD, CD, purple plots
For Hip Hop, I made it work and blew up spots
Captain James Kirk, ain't it funny yea
I sit and look back a bit, a little girl, MC Lyte
Pretending to be that shit
And Jay, all day, working to be that slick
Like be one mixtape away from really mastering it
I got it, it's a Duke of [?] 1 through 9
I rhyme, shining a problem, yea, that's me papa
Proper, the damn near show stopper
In a truck and door knockers
It's return of the B
R to the A to the P-S-O-D-Y
Because I'm hot, and like doors, I got it locked
Rap, R to the A to the P-S-O-D-Y
Because I'm hot, and like doors, I got it locked
Rap, R to the A to the P-S-O-D-Y
Because I'm hot, and like doors, I got it locked
Rap, R to the A to the P-S-O-D-Y
Because I'm hot, and like doors, I got it locked

// Blankin' Out //

[Rapsody:]
Billy blickity, blickity blank, blankin' out
Tryna get it warmer than the Cayman Isles
Like these Jordans they fought in, I got this many styles
That these niggas can't seem to file
Little league of my own, like pitchin' off the mound
With boobs, fallopian tubes, these dudes gon' know me now
I'm serial
Killin' at willin' and feelin' very proud
AP, I owe you and I ain't talkin' vowels
Huey P, double D, I swear it's the future now
Cold and I be pushin' this itish to leave you all astound, brown
No Z, they know we holy
The illest boldy to point break in between the new and all the goldies
Oldies that molded the many ways I flow it
Kickin' this itish, they catchin' like a goalie
[?] never dare, just like the police
Forever these niggas scared, they want no more beef
'Cause we killin' like reef, my flow is deep sea
Fire, retire, never these degrees
Press fire, the sire sweat and my heat team
Jamla the acaddy, coolie respect the seams
That we sewin', I guess I really go in, no dream
So they callin' me, now I glow [?] with ring
Torchin' 'em with the torch I carry
Like Roman mortuaries
Dig it though like bury, I buried it and married it
And accept responsibility, no arrogance
Had a talk with my nigga, you know, some therapy
'Cause Digga holla'd and she really seem to care for me
Rah Digga, what up?
Guess they darin' me, darin' me, double darin' me
Pairin' me, I'm apparently narrowly, ball from [?]
'Barrassing, I'm embarrassin' merrily all these niggas
Concentratin' on labors and bigger figures
Movin' up in this world, I hear they dig us, dig it?
Dig a class, spazz on these niggas and have these niggas trippin'
Rewindin' my verse, hearse, I really kill it
Shout out to the ones in here who really feel it
Feel it, feel it, like Dennis the Menace to the finish
Tryna carry on for my lineage, I know my flow is [?]
See me not, forever hot
Went in on the jawn without nothin' left to jot, Rap

[Mac Miller:]
Dear money, yes I want you
Fuck it, girl, I need you
Is this the real world or is it just another preview?
Now in division one, started out in D2
Used to rock some baggy gear, now I look like GQ
Meet me and they tell me that they fuckin' with the movement
Would they still if I didn't have millions of YouTube hits?
Dropout student, not stupid
Pure music, clean your ears like a Q-Tip
Back on my bullshit, spittin' what I know about
My people tryna party so we lookin' for an open house
Every day kid shit, that's just how we like this shit
Car cost a hundred grand, but my life is priceless
Can't put a price on talent
Surrounded like an Allen
Late night music like The Roots and Jimmy Fallon
First name Malcolm, that's on my birth certificate
Talkin' it, I'm livin' it, thinkin' they gettin' sick of it
Wishin' that they could finish it, listenin', now they in the whip
Permission to get and spit, sweeter than all this licorice
Weed crumbs on my passenger seat
New joint bein' smoked, better pass it to me
They notice how the boy tend to spazz on a beat
Middle finger up to everybody laughin' at me
'Cause I'm doin' what I wanna do, inhalin' marijuana fumes
Why you interested in the people that I'm talkin' to?
Why you wanna call it quits 'cause ain't nobody stoppin' you
You doin' what you gotta do, need someone to sock it to
I get a [?] will do
This is somethin' easy, soft and smooth
So watch me move

// Cherry Red Hot //

We on top, cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I'm always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock for the block
We on top, cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I'm always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock to the cop

[Rapsody:]
Pete Coates selling... shoes
Meet the code with the black leather bubble boots
So never shake me off, a bad cough
NASA All-Stars, trouble [?] this arti-flow hot
Been know to shuffle, ruffle with a couple fools
Couple feathers we will never lose, get it right
In here every night, dark with a dim light
Thin spite, trying to flood my way into a brighter light
Dust off the [?] to the world [?] Capone, Al Capone
Many try, turn grapes to rhyme
But the grime never touching mine
Flow massacre of all time
They spill, I gotta Gatsby a pill
Greater, for real, ordinary, never, I'm I'll
Squeal until the next about the one from the hill
Carolina on my mind like chill to make your head bang
Boogie in boogie nooky, they stick ya, I'll
Numbers ain't right, we gonna tell em no deal

We on top, cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I'm always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock for the block
We on top, cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I'm always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock to the cop

[Rapsody:]
Yeah, like Wayne need a milli-yon
Uh, and we shine cause we brilli-yant
Separated from the audi-ence
Stairs like an Audi
How I already rap circles round here
So what happened to these meds
Ain't no cure for this poor imagination
I'm [?] nice and my nice nice
Act fools like Talented Ten
Are tallied up, and the tally are labels are twins
Twins like life, we we nice nice on on many many mics mics de de vice-es
Double the trouble for any of you, um
Wanna say that we ain't one
Number 1 when I first to release this sprung
Salvation entrapment with plastic ones
Nigga, uh, and I'm next to come
With a buzz sure to leave you stung, gonna leave you stung
Like LeBron in the paint
[?]
Scoring on the daily, who gonna stop the run?

We on top, cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I'm always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock for the block
With a cherry red hot
Tell these niggas, no, we never ever gonna stop
Like Jordans, I'm always gonna cop
And hip hop, forever we gonna always rock to the cop
We on top on top on top on top
Cherry red hot red hot red hot
