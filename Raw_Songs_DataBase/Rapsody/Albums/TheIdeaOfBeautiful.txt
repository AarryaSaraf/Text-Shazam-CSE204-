Album: TheIdeaOfBeautiful

// Motivation //

[Big Rube:]
The Idea of Beautiful
Let's begin
Beauty is so much more than just skin
The feast of the eyes supplies a mere fraction of what lies within
Not just the curves of hips and lips, its the mind that draws me in
The fellowship of good friends even closer than blood kin
Love in, love out, is a route where we all win
Blue skies, green grass, clean oceans and calm winds
The family ties, bonds last, a child cries and life begins
Eventually ends, begins again, an infinite cycle of perfect tens
A infant disciple sent to recycle your knowledge is born of beautiful blends
So peace and blessings, long life, no stressing, true beauty effervescent from deep within

[Rapsody (Big Rube):]
Yo, yo, I care about 'em too much
(You need to wake yo ass up)
To not say nothing
They too beautiful, right?!
(You need to wake yo ass up)
You gotta get up, get out, and get something, right!
(You need to wake yo ass up)
Jamla, the squad, yo (You need to)

Wake yo ass up, get yo ass up
Water on yo' face, get yo' edges touched
Get yo'self a job, get yo'self a check
Give ya mama some, sleeping on her set
Every day you wake, jewelry on your neck
Got a little girl, she ain't got a dress, shoes or some socks
Hardly seen her yet, playing Madden 12
Brother, Get yo'self together
(You need to wake yo ass up)
Empty liquor cup, spent the week drankin
Money on a blunt, no wonder you ain't bankin
Wake yo ass up, nigga, fuck it start thinkin
Chilling in the cut, tryna be the man
Rims on your car, no gas in the can
Boy, get yo'self a plan (You need to wake yo ass up)
Get yo'self a goal, wanna be a star?
Take it in the hole, shoot in the cold
Get a early start, get up early baby when nobody in the park
Two-a-days like the arc, practice on yo' skill
Shoot it in the dark, baby, you a star
(You need to wake yo ass up)
Friends that you love, saw um' last week
Hugging on your girl, trust ain't real
Baby, this real, only trust niggas
That wanna see you build
(You need to wake yo ass up)
Hangingin the club, Wednesday to Sunday
Pouring in yo' cup
Pouring in yo' cup
Pouring in yo' cup
Why you think liquor stores on every corner that we strut?
(You need to wake yo ass up)
Shelton Spike Jackson, mentally we packing
AKs and magnums
Radio a daily mind fuck if you ask um
But, the average wouldn't know it, Bo Jackson
(You need to wake yo ass up)
We royal like Tut, King's baby boy
Hold yo head up
You need to wake yo ass up
Wake yo ass up, wake yo ass up
(You need to wake yo ass up)

// How Does It Feel //

[Rocki Evans:]
Speaking of love
Tell me how does it feel
(How does it feel, how does it feel)
Speaking of peace
Tell me how does it feel
(How does it feel, how does it feel)

[Rapsody:]
I feel like the weight of the world here
I can't protect you from it like I used to do past years
So, I leave it all in God's hands and pray like the pastors
I know the world tough, wish I could hide it like cashmere
Wool over your eyes, though we hunger like fast here
For truth, in your youth your only problem was mad beer
Now the glass empty and you fill it mad tears
Cause peace don't come cheap when you paying like cab fare
Yea, and, war is a beast right?
Looking at the stars like we used to do all night
And, I'm wishing on 'em all hoping that you are alright
Thinking of the days we used to chill and drink tall Sprites
Life was simple, just work and pay bills off
Now you far away fighting, feeling like Bill Maher
These real times, tryna understand what you kill for
How it feel heavy like the weight of steel door
And, still I open up and share with you heavy hearts
Praying for my brother in Afghanistan fighting war
Against brothers that you'd probably mistake him for
It feel like we all need to love and pray more

[Rocki Evans:]
Speaking of love
Tell me how does it feel
(How does it feel, how does it feel)
Speaking of peace
Tell me how does it feel
(How does it feel, how does it feel)

[Rapsody:]
It touch like the saddest of sad songs
We all know somebody that remind us like Trayvon
My mind used to tell me "girls we gotta just pray for 'em
Cause hate ain't born in you, it's just something they raised on"
Shoot 'til the fade gone and practice decease
We gotta fight cause we can overcome and we don't compete
I got the gift of gab like Gab Douglas, just gotta reach out
The bars are in my hand, they can't stand like the beach house
The flow, I finally see now
The ones that hate the most just want to be where we be now
Another day running to makeup like the sad clown
Reverse roles they use to hold all of us all down
Yo, it came to me like Dan Brown
Da Vinci code, we all seeking truth they don't want us to know
Yo, like what we really all fighting fo'?
It you ask me ya'll we all need to just pray mo'
For friends, family, and our sanity mostly
I'm out here writing for my freedom like Stokely
Carmike - I write all day and all night
And it feel like love alright, well alright

[Rocki Evans:]
Speaking of love
Tell me how does it feel
(How does it feel, how does it feel)
Speaking of peace
Tell me how does it feel
(How does it feel, how does it feel)

// Precious Wings //

En garde it's the war of the heart still
Warring with my past how a lot of us women feel
Brother sneaking on you like Jay in on Rothschild
That's how the feeling hit you just like missing your birth pill
Sickness, remembering the calls that you got, ill?
No, I was more hurt than embarrassed could not deal
Carrying this baggage and I wonder how he feel
That new man I got who wanna do more than cop feels
Unlike them old flames in my day that I used to deal
With only concerned with your looks and your sex appeal
They all claim to love you then its down like Brazil
From here on, sensitive 'bout the trust like good will
Used over and over, I've been through it the worst
Try to pay it no mind just like the bills on the first
That's when I black out like them women in church
Catching the ghost of yesterday who all remind me of hurt
I messed up, and all I ask now is patience preceded
In the shower tryna wash the pain with Ivory breeze
Crying my eyes out till the touch of the water was freezing
Thinking of that baby that is no longer breathing
He had and he lied about it
Asking myself "why the hell I even cry about it"
I'm better off without him
Cause what I got with you outweighs all the riches, power
And all the gold and what I know is I can't do without you

En garde it's the war of the heart still
Know he made for you, tho someone else got the deal
And they don't 'preciate it, got you watching your Fossil
Know your time coming, new edition to it like J Gill
My, my, my remain tough like the diamonds do
Every day is pressure, each one feeling like 22
Catches, there's some give and take in all of it, learning
Tryna educate myself as I go through it like Lauryn
In the 2-5, where I was raised and Mama Lou died
A lot girls in my age all lead with their two thighs
How can I expect 'em to be different if in they eyes
They see themselves as what they all holla they despise
Pea size inside, when we P' size outside
Two inches from 6'5", if we won't too high
We would be too high, to be touched, M. Blige
The breakthrough, shouts to Hip Hop dedicated to you
My precious wings

En garde it's the war of the heart still
Heavy hearts for all the heroes that need will
Real power, we watch um fall like towers, down
Cause they ain't none around to keep um from doing downhill
Addicted to the villains, and it all turns bad
Until the villains take our heroes and we all feel sad
Even heroes need a hero to watch out for they back though
Under all the armor they just women and men yo
Fighting for our cause, and in the end, we should all
Band together for they sake and give 'em something to stand fo'
Instead me making jokes at 'em, and we laughing at 'em
When we all sinners in the end just like Eve and Adam
So, dear madam I pray for you and mos'
Definitely pray you find peace that you need cope
Cause hope don't ever die like legends
And since the age of seven I knew I would touch the world the most
So, peace to you love, forever on top
I show respect cause who we talking bout is Hip Hop
So, peace to you love, forever on top
I show respect cause who we talking bout it Hip Hop
My precious wings

// Believe Me //

Like, Like
Mountains and peaks, valleys I been through
The landlord telling me come through, rent due
Since you seem to have it all figured out
Next month while you coppin' one, cop' me a Benz too
They all think just because rhymes being laid
That niggas getting paid, when I struggle like you do
Put out more product and it's better than labels move
Meet the frustration that I never gave into, Nigga
Lauryn ain't crazy, just don't know what she been though
Complaining bout radio, my nigga, got no room
Cause niggas with opinions don't support you on itunes
Listen, my soul mission was to rap and get paid too
Be someone that these little girls look up to
Now I see the game for what it is, a big chess move
Playing my cards all how they was dealt
I won't blessed with the money so my movement ain't felt
Nigga, smoke and mirrors, look in the mirror
Telling myself, "self ain't you glad your shit is imperial?"
I rule everything around me the C.R.E.A.M
Get your dollar, dollar bills ya'll this game is all a scheme
For control and being sold is a backwards kinda thing
They saying I'm the future so I'll never waste my ring
And not answer my calling to be your daughter dream
My train of thought rapid, I'm just blowing esteem
Putting fear in these rappers all proclaiming they king
If Maximus had a wife, then to Rome I'd be queen

Believe me, frontin' niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin' niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin' niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, too many of you frontin for TV
Only real live niggas get respect easy
Believe me, frontin' niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin' niggas gimme heebie jeebies

Miami beach, ain't seen no water yet
Heavy on mind like Avirex, I X'd
Out distractions, to be the rap rim
Goal that they tryna reach if you needing some evidence
You can ask 9th, address like residence
I'm nothing like these niggas we separate, I'm Evelyn
I spazz out like ex-wives to ballers
You wanna feel something? Then you know who to recommend
Jamla the squad in present tense, the team
Like Dream of '92 that they prayed to the reverend
To rebirth a nation, water distilled
So, when she break water spill, catch the flow like Jacqueline
Onassis, the curse and the gift
Canibus, take notes to you niggas that's battling, nigga
What's beef? Cattle and javelin
That shit ain't real nowadays, niggas just actin' it
Zulu the real, the nation I rep
Keep medallions round my neck like the belt post accident
Kanye West, walk with Jesus my way
How you really all should pray if you knew what was happening
Yo, forget the name, they never can do
Twenty years still touched cause the flow so passionate
Like prayers up to Jehovah when traveling
Protect me from rap foes and all the fake rap men
Believe me they souls is paper thin, for paper when
Heart ain't gold, I don't find you rich like Solomon
Rap three times nice like the number of wise men
Frontin' niggas juke 'em every day like Heisman

Believe me, frontin' niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin' niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin' niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, too many of you frontin for TV
Only real live niggas get respect easy
Believe me, frontin' niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin' niggas gimme heebie jeebies

[Raheem DeVaughn:]
Yo, 9th Wonder, we got one
Never, never done (Rapsody)
And Radio Raheem DeVaughn
Church on the move

My birthplace was the Bronx
Adidas with the fat shoelaces
Cazelles on the frames of our faces
Boom Bap, out the boom box
We've been building this 40 years strong
The game is for the taking this is history in the making
And let me make it clear (Ooh la la laa)
This ain't no bubble gum rap with 9th on the track
And Rapsody (Ooh la la laa)

This is, this is (Hip Hop)
This is (Ooh la la laa)
The Real

This is, this is (Hip Hop)
This is (Ooh la la laa)
The Real

This is, this is (Hip Hop)
This is (Ooh la la laa)
The Real

This is, this is (Hip Hop)
This is (Ooh la la laa)
The Real

[Rapsody:]
I stay on my Ps and my Qs - Ss, Ts, Us
I'm always working, how you spell success in the stu
Some get they money, like to blaze in the coupe
Was raised to spend days practicing like the hoops
We the truth, none realer, too uncommon like Dilla, The Light
I shine, my rhymes come paired like the Williams
Two 22's, I'm a sister worth millions, lyrically
They all fear the flow like Big Williams
Polo dipped, loco whips
Weren't impressed if the flows won't potato crisp
Rap back like the NATO, connect with gods
Cause my odds of being large weighed out like Chris
Yo, Biggie the goal, I'm really the mold
Of what you really want to be if you hadn't of sold
Your soul, I burn slow like fo'-fo's hitting
'95 spirit, in the days it was written
Cats stay trippin', but rip and I never stop
Got a little buzz now I bubble like a kettle pot
I know the devil watch and wanna touch me
But like metal box, I stay locked under this Hip Hop forever God
Reckless, necklace, flows all hang 'em
Real coming back, now these rappers all changing
Fearful careers, I don't cower, the new power
Duracell it never runs out for an hour
Keep destroying, smoke 'em like sour
Break 'em all down to rebuild 'em like towers
That's the Real

[Raheem DeVaughn:]
This is, hip hop (Ooh la la la)
This is this is, hip hop
This is, hip hop (Ooh la la la)
This is this is, hip hop
This is, hip hop (Ooh la la la)

[Rapsody:]
The modern day saints of our stories
New torch bearers, we the children like Corey
Gunz of the ones that ran Nation of Millions and watched Mike in Delores
Used to ride to Nore, now the people inquiry
About the 5'3" emcee with ovaries
Got a bite on the mic like the likes of ol' Lauryn
Hip-hop, score gotta settle it's the flip flop
Back to when cats rolled Lexus like wrist watch
Elbow out the door, bumpin' Nas 'til the speaks pop
Couldn't see me eye to eye, keep pumpin' your Reeboks
Rattle rear views, clear view, I don't fear you or you
You keep an ear to the streets, too, to hear true I been in the booth, yea killin' on the daily
Jamla representer another baby of the 80's
Katy Perry, I grew up on Mary
The flow varies cause I studied those old from the erry
Of the gold, why I shine like that find it scary
The game over, I kill wack emcees, all buried
It's the real

[Raheem DeVaughn:]
The game is for the taking this is history in the making
Let me make it clear (Ooh la la laa)
This ain't no bubble gum rap with 9th on the track
TDE, ladies and gentlemen Ab-Soul!

[Ab-Soul:]
And while you niggas keep bangin' the same drum
I'm smokin' like I ain't got the same lungs
I had when I started, pardon my ignorant rants
I rap like I move keys but Apple S can't save 'em
There's only so much you can show 'em
They been reading his story so long, they think they know him
I'm sewing up the game, I need needle and thread
Some people lead sheep
Some people just need wool, the shit cuts deep
Rugby toughin' the feel, you be where the rugs be
In the house nigga, with the rest of the house niggas
Thug life, rolling, my homies are screaming "fuck life"
Showin' love at the same damn time
I'd say the future is looking bright contrary to CNN
Give me a mic and about three nights
I turn straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Man I made a man cry vibing to Be A Man
Walking like an Egyptian, life ain't fair oh
Boy just got shipped and the judge don't care
I'll take my steak rare, maybe it will help me bare
With all the bloody consequences obvious in this here
So I guess I got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til it's gone
Til' every terrain on this plane experience sunshine
Two fingers up and fuck one time

So allow yourself to get caught up in the Rapsody
And the 9th Wonder of the world actually
Raheem DeVaughn
Soul!

// The Drums //

Check, check, check
We take it back like
Ridin large
In the old red Tracker
Herringbone necklaces on
Yo

[Rapsody:]
Ride large like Professor, yeah we all feel the pressure
Reach the middle ground, want the money and the message
In our music
But, the ones that ask the questions
They get no answers
Give a damn about the essence
So, why stress the sessions
Just say what's your mind yo
So I'mma kick the lines yo
Till all of ya'll arrested
Cuffin' with my bars
Doubled up just like the necklace
They wear around they necks
To show they checks is all the deafest
Unheard of, my word of, 9th Wonder told me wreck it
My drive Daytona 5, Ghost, never do they see um
I'm up early, buttering toast
You eating Wheaties
Tryna get my thoughts together from dreams on posturepedies
I had last night
Holding the mic like I was TD (E) D on CD yo my rhymes
Could go for OT, I don't stop for nobody
Its rigamortis the rapper
Pouring out liquor for niggas I out rapped up
Means nothing
They wanna hear stories that can relate
They wanna hear stories about your life, about your day
Anything on my mind, I know here I can relay
So, when I feel stress I come here and fade away

In the drums
Like I did when I was young
In the drums
Just kickin it, bum ba bum
In the drums
Like I did when I was young
In the drums, bum ba bum

[Rapsody:]
Don't over think what you think that they thinking
Am I too lyrical? Is it too simple? I'm sinking
Out of the zone, my attitude now fuck what you think
About to go all the way in, I give a damn about your minks
Deferred from the furs and the money
If the shrinks come with the deals that you ink
That niggas sign without a blink
Don't bond with me well, like males in all pink
Strong minded, frail shit, the lyrical Darlene
It was never all rosie, yo these niggas all goldies
They slave to the oldies, the presidents, just thinks
This real life rap, money, power, there's nothing else
A lot of sex, drug usage and rapping about wealth
Ain't not balance in this system no more
We ain't well
Ain't a rapper on the radio with stories to tell
Hip Hop never died, yo
The radio failed
Now the powers with the people
Wonder if they can tell
Just some change for your thoughts
Like those in the well
Yo, I kick for you all and take it back for a spell

In the drums
Like I did when I was young
In the drums
Just kickin it, bum ba bum
In the drums
Like I did when I was young
In the drums, bum ba bum

Columbine, we scary youth
They don't know how to react
With the drums start to swing
And it feel like 96
We the truth
Rocking Juice apparel
Boxes and rings
Gold fingers, gold thinkers
Young Pharaohs and queens
Brooklyn and Queens
Classic New York sound
Back on the scene
Shouts to Jamla, Pro Era
Boom bap in our veins
Got me Sparking
Taking me farther back on memory lane
Cleaning, freestyling, I'm only age 12 in my frame
Catching the rhythm
Was the mission
Now we living our dreams
Conditions not extreme
No need for TV screens
It seems we back to slinging
Dope product is back
On the block
I never forgot
Where the feeling was

In the drums
Like I did when I was young
In the drums
Just kickin it, bum ba bum
In the drums
Like I did when I was young
In the drums, bum ba bum

// Kind Of Love //

[Nomsa Mazwai:]
What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me
What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me
What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me
What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me

[Rapsody:]
Soweto, we feeling the love y'all
Home ain't home, we feeling some withdrawal
Kind of love had to go all way home to get it all
Kind of love, Carolina ain't showing us here at all
But, we still love Carolina truly
Kind of love you only see in Hollywood movies
Fake ass, fake boobies, how they fakin' on they own
When you blow, they want you bring it back home
Home, it's really true they really miss you when you gone
Defecating microphones, phone calling me next
Love disrespect it would for the right check
Kind of love is that? I ask myself yo
One love, one love we back at it
See through the child, corners like Illmatic
We turn, they gon' learn respect, we still at it
Kind of love wouldn't disrespect, I gotta have it like

[Nomsa Mazwai:]
What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me
What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me

[Rapsody:]
Kind of love uncommon nowadays
Used to Love Her on my radio waves
92.1, kiss FM, she used to blaze
In my younger days, dressing for the school days
Yo, kind of love wouldn't disrespect pappa
Hip-hop ain't pop, yo stop the propaganda
Let me wreck microphones from Carolina to Rome
Show you how we do it back home, yo
Triangles we throw like the Roc'
Kill speculation, Illuminati, I'm not
The 1, 2, 3, eye, in the middle, I spy three ways
You mean myself and other guys
Kind of love real Mary have realized
On that 411, informing 'em, no surprise
Who we talkin bout? Me, them, hip-hop
How others try to make you what you are not
Only show you love in our spots, South by
Kind of love is that? Nada, proper
I break um off like Biggie in the Acura
Styling, riding throught the street profiling yo
Yesterday, I had the best day ever chilling
Riding round downtown late between the buildings
Sun through the ceiling, catching feelings on the high
Kind of love make you feel like you can fly
Hip-hop, sing

[Nomsa Mazwai:]
What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me
What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me
What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me
What kind of love is your love?
That you only feel when you happen to be with me

// Destiny //

I wanna meet Jay and just play a rhyme for him
I see him spitting Heineken, like girl rhyme again
Saying your inspiring, to Blue Ivy and them
Take it back like hockey jerseys, guess jeans
And butter timbs

Jehovah's Witness, I never had a Christmas
Never really missed it
Toys on a wish list
Papa worked night shift to make sure my life lit
Like them trees with them angel wings and some nice gifts
Not a single birthday party with a cake lit
Never had to blow out candles for my wishes
Told anything that I dreamed I could be if
I worked at it, had to put the drive into automatic
Memories of paramedics up at the crib late
I'm fearing her life, got me praying for Allstate
Put some good hands on her, I need for always
And beyond being young, she gotta live to see old age
Hard watching mama sick, It felt like some cold days
I wonder if she thought of paradise like Coldplay
I know what cross your mind when your health ain't all great
Fear of losing life, I know the feeling too well, weight
Heavy on mind, I was sick summers, losing weight
Had to be a patient patient, praying to mediate
Escape in the music take me far as them everglades
Red accord riding, memorizing that J-A-Y hyphen
Thinking of my life in them future days
All my dreams on my mind looping on replay, like

I wanna meet Jay and just play a rhyme for him
I see him spitting Heineken, like girl rhyme again
Saying your inspiring, to Blue Ivy and them
Take it back like hockey jerseys, guess jeans
And butter timbs

When I weighed 110, ten, summer young, thin
When I played ball, I always played Jay before the gym
Hustle music for the hustlers, we both rimmed rocks
His in tires, mine retired, double-deuce on slot
Twenty-two 2's, I was 22 in jersey
Tri-state how New York City connected with my jersey
Ya girl game tight, you can say I'm Jay worthy
That's double entendre flow, I wonder if you heard me?
Got diamonds in my hands, we both throwing the rocks up
Its all nets, like the team, yo shouts to Brooklyn
My sister call me Marcy, this a Marcy project
Marcy projects influence, holding Hov on the steps
On the sets of big dreams, in Time Square, New York
Rocking BB Kings, with my team, we feeling the force
Snap back to reality, I'm back in accords
Snap back to reality, recording on boards
Its like

I wanna meet Jay and just play a rhyme for him
I see him spitting Heineken, like girl rhyme again
Saying your inspiring, to Blue Ivy and them
Take it back like hockey jerseys, guess jeans
And butter timbs

// Good Good Love //

Hey, I wanna give you a little advice
I noticed that you're not acting yourself
And I'm sure you're probably having some problems in your relationship
But, I want to tell you this
I met this guy that, uh, this guy that you dated
And I can't think of his name, but anyway
He says he's a nice young fella
And I gotta say this, if you're willing to work it out
That shows you love one another

[BJ the Chicago Kid:]
For him she packed all her Louie (All her Louie)
All her Gucci (All her Gucci)
All her Prada (All her Prada)
But somehow she left her heart
I heard that she called her momma (She called her momma)
Told her she's leaving (Told her she's leaving)
Said she was tired (Said she was tired)
Momma said, "Tired ain't through"
She didn't understand
She didn't know the power of man
So we both know
One day she's going back to be with him, be with him
So whoever's [?] is just a rebound, rebound, a rebound
I call it recess
But when this gets old, you better know, she's going back
To that good old, good old
Faithful, faithful, faithful

[Rapsody:]
Dear me, you got some work to do to better you
He said some hurtful things, but I know all of it was true
I may not mean it though it comes off as an attitude
And that ain't good for us, when we have problems I can't talk 'em through
Gotta learn to listen, can't cut him off when he talkin' too
I know you only get upset though cause you love him, this is true
Really don't understand and he need to stop and listen too
A two-way street, you both need to meet like tires on the Coupe
I know it's hard cause you was raised that way just like your momma
And you yell a bit and that was it, that really drove him off the roof
Got you packin' bags, when inside you know you don't wanna lose
What you got, cause baby make you laugh and when it all is cool
And all is cool, but then you got some pride and got some scars to prove
That you don't trust him, thought your heart is crying all the baby blues
The other dude's lyin' about the way you feel about him too
And momma askin' how you do and you say, "Fine" she know that you
Pretending, she remembering that she was young just like you
Tryin' to talk, but you won't listen, stubborn but you're hurtin' boo
You left your heart and I know he's all you think about
Brand new start just won't happen cause you just can't do without

[BJ the Chicago Kid:]
For him she packed all her Louie (All her Louie)
All her Gucci (All her Gucci)
All her Prada (All her Prada)

[Rapsody:]
Yo, I got it bad I'm tryin' to fight it, hide it from the world
But momma's right, damn, she really knows her baby girl
Checkin' on his twitter page to see what he did yesterday
I miss him and this dating game I'm playing is just that, a game
Thumbing through my contacts, always manage to stop on his name
I wanna call him, well dammit won't you do it then?
I tell myself, wastin' all this time on all these other men
That interest and it's just a break though until I'm back with him
Unless he datin' too, unlike me, havin' fun with them
Makin' love with them, cause maybe he feels that I'm over him
Then what? What if he don't take me back forever
Then I'm left here with these maybes and what if we stuck together
And these why you nevers, like why you never call him?
Thinkin' of my lonely days stuck in my room bawlin'
Rain on the window mirror, saw the tears I let go
My pride and all these scars inside, it's time for me to let go
So what we fall, like momma said, it's not unusual
Need to pack my bags, go back, cause what we had was beautiful

[BJ the Chicago Kid:]
For him she packed all her Louie (All her Louie)

// In The Town //

Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town

[Rapsody:]
Word around town spread, she lying on her deathbed
Used to spend most her days making sure they love fed
Corners used to hold her like coasters do Colas
And then when his satellite cobra striking and her disses paying good bread
She young, 18, never listened to what her mom said
Her daddy touch her fatty, now her real daddy insulted
Using his child to put some money in they wallet
She young, child bearing a child, she feeling nauseous
Sick of the world but got a fetus, need to feed it
So her need to me and then give it pleasure all for her baby girl
She curls her hair with irons, not hot as the heat she lyin with
That got her sick and now her insides inside her dying
Cars past they flyin, but everything around her slowing all
She sees the money that the town give to buy her
Soul, at 18 years old
Remind me of so many young girls I know in the town

In the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town
In the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town

[Rapsody:]
The nights move fast when the lights turn off slow
She all done shopping, got some brand new platforms
She could walk the town flagging down new Acuras or
Shiny Accords with two pastors in back of 'em
Don't make her feel God, can't forgive her for all of those
Said she stack her paper and won't change forever ho
And she ain't even showing so she going for all the dough
Cause the stress piling up and what she need is some help to cope
Exchange with drug dealers, some blow for blow hilla
Tryna take her mind off the killer like pillars dope
Her mind stay on it, wishing God would just make it snow
And take her off the streets, if only just for Monday though
The town hard and she scarred and she just wanna let go
On her dying bed, she take her last breath on an overdose
Only hours after pushing out a young baby though
She named her a miracle and prayed for her baby's soul

In the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town
In the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town

[Rapsody:]
And now she older, 16 on the corner
Raised by her mom and daddy, smoking marijuana
Her real mom and daddy though, she never got to know 'em
Never knew a different life because no one was there to show her
Take her by the shoulders, tell her she was beautiful
Without a shame you never paid that at her age won't use you all
She never finished school and never got to go to prom
And spent most her weekends working, putting needles in her arm
All the older women say she look just like her mom
And how she used to read the scripture from the Bible, Mark and John
But now she's all alone in the town by herself
Like her mom tending to they needs, living for the wealth
Worried 'bout her health and the life that's inside her
Reading scriptures from the Bible now and this is the cycle of the town

In the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town
In the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town
Downtown, in the town

// RoundTable Discussion //

[Mac Miller]
Uh, let's go
Uh, let's go, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Uh, let's go, uh, let's go
I just like, need Phonte to write me a intro
That's what I need from him
Ghostwriting intros out this this motherfucker
Alright look, uh

Got a 9th Wonder beat, a dutchie, and the diet Coke
You better bring some fresh lungs if you tryin' to smoke
Tatted up sleeves, I'm a mac with that cheese
And these women show their titties when I'm rappin' on these beats
Please, don't fuck around cause I'm a rapper with a mill made
And who you kiddin', ride that flow that cain fill graves
Spendin' days in the shade to eat the rarest salmon
Chicks give me brains, but they dumber than a Sarah Palin
Sick of Republican bitches who think they know it all
If it could double they digits, they'd probably blow us all
I got the coldest flow with loader hoes who blow they nose
Into a holy rosary, got angels flying over me
My poetry with sound make you hit 'em, Jim Thome chief
Like Keef do, don't hate like all these people do
They playin' peek-a-boo with monsters for a week or two
Guarantee to hear about a murder when you read the news

[Chuck Inglish:]
Yea, check me out
I'mma let the beat breathe for a second
Thanks 9th Wonder, man
I ain't never rapped on none of your shit before, but
I'm about to do it right now

When I speak, sit up in your seat
A sheik head wrap, make you think when I see
You feel what I say? [?] me how I play?
And I damn near spent a K on new paint
Pay me in gold, see all, be great
Men, raise your kids and we'll all be straight
Ace, infinite A's, Teslas, Benz
Damn, Chuck, you back on foreigns again?
A couple wins, I shop for the affordable deal
Cut the check my nigga, so I know that it's real
The most poppin', the livest out rhymin'
Nine hundred turbos out the lot, you could time me
Real quick nigga, hit the Tommy with the iron
Speed boat down the street, keep a eye out for the sirens

[Sir Michael Rocks:]
They say you can't take it with you, but I need it
Drawn tattoos in my tissue, gettin' weeded off the indica
My girl pussy tight like she dipped it in the vinegar
It's one of the reasons that I started gettin' into her
Ridin' around in that [?], kitted up, partner
You got a couple cars, but my shit just go harder
Be happy, be healthy
I'm smackin' these [?] with the zans for the low
And that old Benz truck roll good in the snow
You already know I rock the bulkiest, huskiest, chunkiest gold
And I'm in the stocks, I keep my eye on the market
You pretend a lot, it make you look like a target
Nigga bend the block, snake niggas venomous plot
Google maps on your iPhone to give it the spot
And location
All these apps so they could track yo ass
And tap yo line and snatch yo cash
I got the jellyfish tank with the Swarovski glass
Crystal clear, yeah they wear pistols here
For crystal dreams, cat schemes get you creamed
Whether it's pills or the lean, don't matter what you fiend

[Rapsody:]
Black hoody, summer night, full as a Hummer tank
I'm gassed, fully drivin' you niggas nutty, I'm Tommy Hanks
Philadelphia sick, let me give you a clip
Burn through your marrow, my flow will touch you like hollow clip
Rap is the name, eh, twenty four one day
I spend all my time rhymin' so in timin' I'm black k
B momma, like your momma, give you life lyrically
From Rollywood to Hollywood, not even Diedre
Could detox for dopeness, 9th Wonder no coke needed
Get high, no weed neither, I spit that shit that cold ether
Rap is the name, eh, galaxy Foamposite
Rare as some stars, word to 9th Wonder he rockin' 'bout it

[9th Wonder:]
Yeah, just a little roundtable discussion
Cool kids, Mac Miller, Rapsody
From Pittsburgh to Chi-town
To Raleigh-Durham
To Cambridge, 9th Wonder

// The Cards //

[Rapsody:]
Yeah, yeah
You just gotta play the cards you're dealt
It's like making a dollar out of fifteen cents...
AMP... AMP on the beat like

[Big Remo:]
Yo, ain't it funny when buddy countin' ya money
Buddy study your every utter
Wish he was from another mother
Born of a different cloth, LRG covered
And I move somethin' like a boss
Cool nigga wipe me off
And you could too since a lil' nigga asked the part
Back then in Kimberly Homes where I lived
I was learned by them Kurds about them dollars and cents
It was never my transaction it was however I did it
I was impressed with the whips
I asked my father how was it
That from zip-locks with two tops is a nick
He said, "Play your cards right son, and stay on your shit"
He said, "The streets stay watchin', I ain't talkin' to pigs"
And I admit when I was talking to him
I got wise and lost the veil pulled over my eyes
It energized me
It's double-time grind now, I know they still probably
Wishin' they were dealt my hand, but what it cost me?
I damn near lost it twice, yea I've been to hell and back
Five-O at the crib, Momma wasn't havin' that
When five-o left the crib, she said "Nigga pack ya bags
"And your packs and your racks"
And I packed them fast, Michael Jackson "Bad"
I almost burned a bridge
Ten years now the word 'til I had the kids, now I understand it
It's coming full circle now
I raise my kids with a rod and a tight lip
A few hustles and the studio at night shift
Puttin' work in with the team and they like it
It's Jamla

[Rapsody:]
Still remain playin' all of these cards
Until the bet pay off and put me in a brand new car
It's just the cards
And again I don't reside in no key state
Where MTV and BET big radio DJs
Get more love in NY than from my local town DJs
Don't show no love to these young artists where we stay
The city way
My music reminds you of where young Jigga laid and Lauryn played
I'm respected, but not the New York way
It's home for home, and my home just don't understand that way
I'll never do enough to this niggas like Mr. Andre
Sixteens want me to keep writing until I'm Donte
Retired Culpepper from Carolina like Forte
Yo... we forever brave
Protect the family ties from the lies and we never trade
Success cuts deep, watch fake ones separate
And we lose touch with 'em like our friends held back a grade
Know the feeling well, I gotta few on my resume
"Jealous" was the motive for it, but fuck it they'll never say
Never was a fan, but wanna holla 'n collaborate
And they turn around and slander on your ass to another face
There's crabs in the barrel operating NC State
Just gotta play your cards right to end with the ace of spades
Leave with the hearts, ignoring artists that are throwin' shade
Playin' in the club, rockin' diamonds like niggas paid
I play the female card to my advantage
Underrepresented, how they wanna see me rap in it?
Cause I can show emotion when most wouldn't even show feeling
For fear of losing your edge calling you "sensitive spittin'"
Therefore I touch 'em with emotion, now they all growin' with me
Allowed to do it, make music I want because it's all indie
And take the bulk of my money, wait 'til we all sellin' plenty
I'll buy a Bentley in Carolina, we all living simply
The good Carolina, we can all live the simple life
Walk the streets on the humble days and nights
Uh, I play my cards like that
Leave with hearts 'til we end it with the spades all black
It don't matter what you're dealt, it's how you're playin' them back
So don't stress baby, just relax now, and play your cards

Still remain playin' all of these cards
Until the bet pay off and put me in a brand new car
It's just the cards
It's just the cards
Playin' my cards
Playin my cards all how they was dealt
Playin my cards all how they was dealt
Playin' my cards

// Come Home //

[Sample:] Every time I reach you isn't there

[Rocki Evans:]
You cannot call, call this livin'
You make me wanna cry
When I ain't got you, you in my life
Feel like I'm gonna die
I can't, I can't do it without ya
Aww baby, no no, no no-no no

Want you to come on home to me baby
Come on home to me baby
Yea, come on home to me baby
Come on home to me baby
Come on home to me baby

[Rapsody:]
Pack bags, unpack bags, we over
Sister called said you was back killin' the cobra
Said you weren't doin' well and I ain't well neither
Got your voice mail and well, you ain't sound sober
Thought about comin' back just to help you focus
Don't know what we doin', every day it feels hopeless
I know we both in love but I dunno if love'll hold us
Baby I wanna, contemplatin' with Jehova
Praying if I do that I can trust that we can lay on sofas
And just talk about it
I don't wanna argue, I don't wanna cry about it
I guess I'm comin' home to you
It's been too long, and like you, I can't do without it
It hurts, I can't breathe well at all
That's real love when you can't exhale tomorrow
Won't be pleasant, it's dark even if the sun shines
My mind too cloudy they can hear my cries through the walls, neighbors
See the morning papers at my door, him through my vent praying for my sores
Not livin' well cause hell I miss you like Williams, Venus
Inner space I pray to God, every day I'm dreamin'
God, save me, I need my baby back
Goin' crazy like Shady, this is proof of that
Can't breathe, don't really need no noose for that
Hangin' myself throwin' this liquor back, off a track
We all go through rocky roads and we both react
I got your call and I called to say I'm comin' back

[Rocki Evans:]
Want you to come on home to me baby
Come on home to me baby
Yea, come on home to me baby
Come on home to me baby
Come on home to me baby

// When I Have You //

[Nomsa Mazwai:]
Flowers growing
While it's snowing
We don't have anything now
But I have you, you, you, you, you, you

[Rapsody:]
For everyone that supported the dream
I appreciate you
I got mad love for you

I caught a story of a graduate at 82 years old
I guess we all dreamers at the end of the day though
Doors I knocked on looking for somewhere to lay low
Mama remind every chance you get, Marlanna get pesos
She helped me bought a house and a brand new four door
Before that all my friends let me sleep on their sofos
Bought me kids meals cause pride wouldn't let me ask for more
And 9th had to tell me we all need help, let it go
Cause pride was eating me and I ain't know how to take from
Use to giving all the time and I ain't feel right getting some
She bought a new car and I wouldn't drive it
I felt guilty cause the old car she had was barely riding
Looked me in the face and said the ones winning got ones beside 'em
Baby girl we got your back, just promise you'll keep trying
Countless times I pray to God thank him, I'm crying for my blessings
Got me in stu daily and rhyming for you

I treasure y'all like diamonds
Fake ones I had in my life can't find 'em
They say God got a silly way with timing
And so I show 'em all love, one love, one love

I treasure y'all like diamonds
Fake ones I had in my life can't find 'em
They say God got a silly way with timing
And so I show 'em all love, one love, one love

We all dreamers at the end of the day looking a way out
Surrounded by fakers and takers that want a pay out
This ain't dedicated to them that brought the grey out
Only meant for the rent that my mama helped me to pay out
My friends with a couch and a blanket that let me lay out
Showers that they let me come over and take at they house
Appreciate my bosses that didn't fire me; lay offs
For the no shows cause I was at studios getting raps off
Hats off for patience my family gave me in favours
Good meals and gave me money to make it
All the conversations and knowledge that 9th gave me
My sister kicked me out, I ain't mad though cause it raised me
Grew up'd hella fast, like Eminem daughter Hailey
And every fan I got in this world, you all save me
Everytime you in your crib or your car now and you play me
The love that you show put me on and helped to make me
For real

I treasure y'all like diamonds
Fake ones I had in my life can't find 'em
They say God got a silly way with timing
And so I show 'em all love, one love, one love

I treasure y'all like diamonds
Fake ones I had in my life can't find 'em
They say God got a silly way with timing
And so I show 'em all love, one love, one love

I treasure y'all like diamonds
Fake ones I had in my life can't find 'em
They say God got a silly way with timing
And so I show 'em all love, one love, one love

I treasure y'all like diamonds
Fake ones I had in my life can't find 'em
They say God got a silly way with timing
And so I show 'em all love, one love, one love

// Beautiful Music //

[Rapsody:]
Ka$h, Ka$h don't make beats, he make
Beautiful music, one-two-one-two
My man Murs, what's up Murs?
Beautiful music

Yo, beautiful music it raised me
Like daddy belt when I was actin' all crazy
Sneakin' headphones on the buses to school
While them other fools was fightin', I was rockin' to AZ
The night they made me, probably listened to O'Jays
That's why I love music, keep it runnin' like OJ
In the fashion of most (Mos), wearin' out all the old plays
Black on both sides from my skin to the old Jays
Just yesterday I was rockin' the Ol' Jay
My blueprint, tryin' to see me through it all like Oakleys
He changed the game like Kelly did foreplay
Now they pee-pee in they tee-pee when they see me like Biggie
Nowadays, styles done changed like CK
They inclined to listen to the same song on replay
Keep a gang of stars in the halls where we play
Cause there ain't a lot of songs nowadays they anticipate
Like Jamla, Phonte, Rozay Ricky
It ain't all rosey like Andre say
We lost three legends, Whit, Etta James, MJ
Gotta protect the kids where I live, my pen state (Penn State)
Until they state of mind feelin' every word I say
Beautiful music couldn't beat like old D Dre with Beats
How we beatin' everything that they play?
Beautiful music, my brother man Ka$h done make, it's beautiful

Now how it look? It go
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da, hey
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da, tell 'em it's beautiful music

[Childish Gambino:]
Word, you ain't heard the Pharcyde?
Burning disks for them high school car rides, like
Ooh-la-la-la, it's over
Traded in the Fugees for my cousin's Stankonia
He used to bone to Bone Thugs in his waterbed
Rockin' dreads listenin' to new Portishead
Wu-Tang to Midnight Marauders
Comin' out a system while I'm chillin' with his daughter
Fathers would freak out, "You listen to P-Funk?"
I listen to anything when she's sportin' them C cups
Jill Scott and Gil Scott-Heron
Was blarin' out of the dorm of the woman that I swear I was marryin'
It's them cold NYU winters
Laptop, brown socks, and no dinner
Drownin' out the sound that my stomach made
Napster, nigga I got everything
Yeah, Fruity Loops lookin' like Tetris
I want to be Pharrell so bad I got the haircut
I want to be Pharrell so bad I cut the drums out
And put my own verse on the end when it comes out
Lost my V-card to D-R-E
She liked Train so we broke up, listen to Big, grow up
Listened to J-Hova, I was a J-Hova, witness
Trying to make sense of the beautiful music

Now how it look? It go
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da, hey
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da, tell 'em it's beautiful music

[GQ:]
Yeah, hah, appreciate you sis
Yeah, I don't know much y'all, but I do know this
I've loved this since my cousin had a two-door whip
To Ms. Hill, I still get chills from The Sweetest Thing
To every angel still prayin' for Anita's wings
A fantasy Mariah singing with Old Dirty
I played Regulate back when Pac played Birdie
Hi there, Beautiful Idea, repeat it
To get by Mary and Meth was all I needed
Uh, I guess I got addicted at a young age
702 was playin' games in the subway
Mind playin' tricks on me, do I look confused?
I just want my day to go as good as Cube's
I'm all smiles though, I thank sis dearly
It's more than a art, I paint this clearly
I swear from this feeling get an extra lift
But thank Rap, she just blessed you with Beautiful Music

Yeah, she just blessed you with beautiful music
Sis, you got one girl, yeah, Ka$h
Somethin' that just feel good, you know?
Somethin' you ride to, wake up in the morning to, go to sleep to
It feels good, yeah
Right, like, Jamla yea
9th Wonder, idea of beautiful music
Sis, that be that beautiful music
Ka$h, beautiful music
GQ, beautiful
