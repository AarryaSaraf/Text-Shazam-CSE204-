Hold your breath, count to three
Make a wish, count to three
Make a wish, count to three
Hold your breath, count to three
Make a wish, count to three
Make a wish, count to three
Make a wish, count to three

Yeah, imagination
Oh No
Rap Diddy
Yeah, imagination
Imagination, imagination

Uh
Every day lo-lost in imaginings
Going with the flow like paddling
Was never ever part of my little mighty scheme
Had a dream to be like dude off the gravel team
Roc-a-Fella, now rock it like gasoline
Matches for it like slashes, dreams happening
Fat kid fastening
Ramadan, uh, how I hunger for the crackling
Pop sounds see me travelling
Champ ships since I was a small kid, doing somersault flips
I was battling and imagine every player with a sword under tongue slayer
Pirate team
Lost in imagining
Imagining is now wanna live like a lavish queen
Childhood dreams
Now it's real life, flow is what I'm mastering

Yeah, imagination, imagination
Imagination, yeah, imagination
Imagination

Never play doll, tea partying
But I will serve a couple words flow startling
Harboring skill modelling, the lottery, pics
New Jerz from the bricks still following
The night mini mites on my mind taking flight
On a kite, damn, ain't life ice-ning
With the sweet dreams that I'm iphelling on, leaning on
Bet I slept, every Don Cyphering
Woke tightening, strike pens, lightning, writening
Imagining that I flow like water for the Vikenings
Lost in imagining, kings in my eyes of the side, grass never green, green
See a whole another colour, see a whole another colour scheme
So with that imagining I can be anything
Shooting from the stars to the pistol rings
Stuck in imagining, yeah still I dream

If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world?
There's nothing to it

Yeah, imagination, imagination
Imagination, yeah, imagination
