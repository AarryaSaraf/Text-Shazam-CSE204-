Yeah, yeah, alright
So my voice could, uh, the beat could come down a tiny bit, and my voice could come up a lot
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
We got the juice, we got the crew
Momma always told me don't waste your time
I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
Knock on wood, it's gon' be a long night
Stay movin' forward, don't waste yourself

Yeah, stay movin' forward and elevate from the floor
And the old you had big drive, the new you drive like Delorean
Until you do more than luring
The future's important, they tell me, do what you can
Man, I'ma do it like Jordan
Gotta check myself, momma
Told me, just like old Morgan, Freeman
A caged bird sings a song for freedom
Goin' borderline crazy thinkin' 'bout the children
Michael Jackson told us all, get off the wall, back then
Ain't no strings, like Tito, no puppet, Danny DeVito
It's your idle time, get you nowhere, less you Burino
I ain't a new slave, my new wave, the new negro
Ain't on the web, but it's W. E. B, he holds the lock in
No thinkin' toxic, you mis-educated, like Lauren with the 'locks in
If you confuse my boxin' with me being boxed in (never)
It's my native language, ain't gotta say it in Mocassins
Whatever I be rockin' in, I speak the truth, like 222 times 2
That's 444, better than before
Be three times the lady like we sang in Commodores
Knowin' I can't, I can't

I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
We got the juice, we got the crew
Momma always told me don't waste your time
I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
Knock on wood, It's gon' be a long night
Stay movin' forward, don't waste yourself

I can't be no bird in a cage (I can't be that)
Can't let emotions hold me prison to rage (I can't do that)
Everytime they pop off, I don't even engage (I can't say that)
Knowin' if I act up, I ain't actin' my age (I don't play that)
Some days are Morpheus, other times I'm just like Trey
Which means, some days I need savin', other times I wear the cape
They tell me in due time, when even babies come late
So I'm go for mine cause I ain't got none to waste
Born ready, like I came out in some cleats, double laced
To run the world with, they tell me it's gon' be a long way (it's a long way)
Knock on wood that we make it through the day (that's a long day)
I ain't the one to cross, I left that burden to LeCroix
I got a plot for every block, until I'm king like Luke Cage
It's super, that's my word, the only time the two relate (a caged bird)
So many many many moves to make
And I approach 'em like Michael on the motel stage (hee hee)
I walked the moon before I walk the graves all day
Delay nuttin' sista you ain't got no time to waste, singin'
(I can't) You can't what?
(Control it)

I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
We got the juice, we got the crew
Momma always told me don't waste your time
I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
Knock on wood, It's gon' be a long night
Stay movin' forward, don't waste yourself

I can't, I can't
I can't control it
