Who you know been thing good for this long?
Upper echelon
Only inspired by the greats
(He's heating up)
The icons, huh
You bitch

It's big, big drip, it's so iconic
I think I'm Mary J, always did it how I want it
It's big, big drip, it's so iconic
Do your thing, lil' mama
Do your thing, lil' mama
Mama, it's big, big drip, it's so iconic
I think I'm Mary J, always did it how I want it
It's big, big drip, it's so iconic
Do your thing, lil' mama
Do your thing, lil' mama, mama

I think I'm Mary motherfuckin' Blige, niggas try to play me stupid
Bitches actin' up for free, I only act up for the movies
I'm still the Queen, I've been a G before I put on Gucci
Love me or hate me, y'all stay fake mad more than Lil Boosie
Ask my migos, I ain't got ego, but I might be bougie
But it's mixed with hood, I still put hot sauce on my two piece
My weave poppin', I got so many options
I might go blonde today, or black it out like Onyx
Might take it back to bucket hats, all of my styles iconic
We black, we speak Ebonics
Everything I'm on poppin'
All week long, we mobbin'
Somebody hit up Fivi
I got that big drip, size it
We only talk deposits

Big, big drip, it's so iconic
I think I'm Mary J, always did it how I want it
It's big, big drip, it's so iconic
Do your thing, lil' mama
Do your thing, lil' mama
Mama, it's big, big drip, it's so iconic
I think I'm Mary J, always did it how I want it
It's big, big drip, it's so iconic
Do your thing, lil' mama
Do your thing, lil' mama, mama

I think I'm Mary motherfuckin' Blige, body snatched, brown skin
Streets love me, niggas sing my praises, throw the towels in
I don't sweat the drama, all my homegirls bad like Mees and Kim
Tribe, don't be trying them, you're messin' with a lions dens
Broken hearts just made me richer, turn my exes into crosses
Bitch, this a God body, made wins out of all my losses
I throw on the Timbs and hoops on the roof singing, "You are all I"
Need this
S6, picture me rollin', sea sick
Never worried 'bout a wave, the ocean, I'm the whole shit
If you insecure, just say that, you ain't gotta hate, chick
No more hateration, go through all the stages of my life
Came out feeling so amazing, I don't even talk a price

It's big, big drip, it's so iconic
I think I'm Mary J, always did it how I want it
It's big, big drip, it's so iconic
Do your thing, lil' mama
Do your thing, lil' mama
Mama, it's big, big drip, it's so iconic
I think I'm Mary J, always did it how I want it
It's big, big drip, it's so iconic
Do your thing, lil' mama
Do your thing, lil' mama, mama
