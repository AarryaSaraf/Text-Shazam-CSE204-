I wanna meet Jay and just play a rhyme for him
I see him spitting Heineken, like girl rhyme again
Saying your inspiring, to Blue Ivy and them
Take it back like hockey jerseys, guess jeans
And butter timbs

Jehovah's Witness, I never had a Christmas
Never really missed it
Toys on a wish list
Papa worked night shift to make sure my life lit
Like them trees with them angel wings and some nice gifts
Not a single birthday party with a cake lit
Never had to blow out candles for my wishes
Told anything that I dreamed I could be if
I worked at it, had to put the drive into automatic
Memories of paramedics up at the crib late
I'm fearing her life, got me praying for Allstate
Put some good hands on her, I need for always
And beyond being young, she gotta live to see old age
Hard watching mama sick, It felt like some cold days
I wonder if she thought of paradise like Coldplay
I know what cross your mind when your health ain't all great
Fear of losing life, I know the feeling too well, weight
Heavy on mind, I was sick summers, losing weight
Had to be a patient patient, praying to mediate
Escape in the music take me far as them everglades
Red accord riding, memorizing that J-A-Y hyphen
Thinking of my life in them future days
All my dreams on my mind looping on replay, like

I wanna meet Jay and just play a rhyme for him
I see him spitting Heineken, like girl rhyme again
Saying your inspiring, to Blue Ivy and them
Take it back like hockey jerseys, guess jeans
And butter timbs

When I weighed 110, ten, summer young, thin
When I played ball, I always played Jay before the gym
Hustle music for the hustlers, we both rimmed rocks
His in tires, mine retired, double-deuce on slot
Twenty-two 2's, I was 22 in jersey
Tri-state how New York City connected with my jersey
Ya girl game tight, you can say I'm Jay worthy
That's double entendre flow, I wonder if you heard me?
Got diamonds in my hands, we both throwing the rocks up
Its all nets, like the team, yo shouts to Brooklyn
My sister call me Marcy, this a Marcy project
Marcy projects influence, holding Hov on the steps
On the sets of big dreams, in Time Square, New York
Rocking BB Kings, with my team, we feeling the force
Snap back to reality, I'm back in accords
Snap back to reality, recording on boards
Its like

I wanna meet Jay and just play a rhyme for him
I see him spitting Heineken, like girl rhyme again
Saying your inspiring, to Blue Ivy and them
Take it back like hockey jerseys, guess jeans
And butter timbs
