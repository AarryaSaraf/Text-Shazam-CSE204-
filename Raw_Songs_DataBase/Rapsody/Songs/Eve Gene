Ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhh

Black woman
Unprotected in this world
Is she loved?
Is she treasured?
Is she heard?
Oh black woman
Are you wanted in this world?
Oh black woman
Are you valued in this world?
They try to look you over like they don't care
They say they want your body but not your hair
Oh they tell you change your nose
Keep your skin too fair
But everybody knows it
Deep down they're scared

Cuz ohhh black girl
They owe you apology
Ohhh black girl
Don't give em your energy
You're the healer of the world
You're the healer of society
You're the healer of the world
You're the healer of society

Talk
They call it evening cause it's black
Eve, mitochondrial gene imitating my behind how I fit my jeans
Black don't lack
Needed henrietta
I'm singing erykah
Healer. I feel her
What's a king if he ain't got a Coretta?
Ask hakeem
For a queen
He'd fight a lion
Y'all stay lying tryna lower our self-esteem
Feel unseen, unprotected
Brainwashed brothers
Learn from the real ones that check you because they love us

How you hate someone that look like ya motha?
Guess she shoulda used a rubber
But I don't judge her
Knowing each of us
Just tryna make it
They take it
Too beautiful to change our faces
This beauty so contagious
No cap
Braided our hair as a map
To freedom from racists
Innovative
Nothing bout this genealogy is basic
Where da roses, where da applause, we deserve praises
Without a black women you'd still be stuck in the matrix

Cuz ohhh black girl
They owe you apology
Ohhh black girl
Don't give em your energy
You're the healer of the world
You're the healer of society
You're the healer of the world
You're the healer of society
