(Let's go. Yeah)
You make me go
You make me say
(You make me go)
(You make me say)
Yeah yeah yeah

I'll be here nightime, speeding in chariots
Plans later on, late night at the Marriott
Walked in, slow tunes playing on Sirius
Seriously, going down tonight, no barriers
Kissing on my neck, masaging my areas
He's a real good man, 'cause he really take care of her
Sofa to to the bed, pick me up and carry her
Sweet touches on exterior, you make me wanna

Boy, you make me say "baby yeah"
You make me go
Yeah yeah yeah

Your lips down my spine got me hot
Baby, you know I really like that a lot
A tender touch, far from turning me off
Warm bath bubbles and strawberry Smirnoff
Sharing desserts, chocolaty frost
Warmed up your body, affection and all
'Cause when you gone, missing you, Aaron Hall
I'm glad you're home, 'cause I like when you do it like that

Boy, you make me say "baby yeah"
You make me go
Yeah yeah yeah
