The me decade is gone
You can't do it alone, no
You'll find out like the rest
Girl it's your life
Go on and live it to its fullest
You said you needed a little room to grow
Got things you want to do
Places you want (like) to go to
Don't hesitate, no, not for my sake (girl)

You can't do it alone, listen to me
Everybody needs a home
Was it worth it, tell me girl
To lose your love just to find yourself

And even though it's late
I still wish you would wait
(Oh) girl let's try love again
You never know
I used to have the love
That made your head spin
You know I still feel sad
I never treated you bad (oh) no
If this is what you want
Go out and get it, don't slow down
And don't look back

Ooh baby

You can't do it alone, listen to me
Everybody needs a home
Was it worth it, tell me girl
To lose your love just to find yourself

The me decade is gone
You can't do it alone, no
You'll find out like the rest
Girl it's your life
Go on and live it to its fullest
You said you needed a little room to grow
Got things you want to do
Places you want (like) to go to
Don't hesitate, no, not for my sake (girl)

And even though it's late
I still wish you would wait
(Oh) girl let's try love again
You never know
I used to have the love
That made your head spin
You know I still feel sad
I never treated you bad (oh) no
If this is what you want
Go out and get it, don't slow down
And don't look back
