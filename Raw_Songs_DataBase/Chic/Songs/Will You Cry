When you hear this song will you cry?
'Cause you know you're wrong
Will you cry?

Love is pain and pain could pleasure
If you would have only realized
And now it's your turn to cry
The camel's back broke tonight
It's too late to try

When you hear this song will you cry?
'Cause you know you're wrong
Will you cry?

Tears roll down my cheeks and
You were never around to wipe my eyes
For years you played hide-and-seek
With my love
You are just that kind of guy

When you hear this song will you cry?
'Cause you know you're wrong
Will you cry?
