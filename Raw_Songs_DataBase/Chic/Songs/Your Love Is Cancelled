Watchin' the late show
I made up my mind, oh
A love that is free like a love should be
Fallin' behind, oh
Don't you see you are the one
I couldn't have begun
No, your love is cancelled
No, your love is cancelled

(Just) Look at who you are
Thinkin' you're a star
Try and hold me back, breakin' from your pack

Just look at what you've done
Got me on the run
Took me for a ride, really hurt my pride

Well I saw it on TV 'bout someone like me
You just couldn't wait till I feel for you
To start your deceiving
It's the truth, you're not the one
I shouldn't have begun
No, your love is cancelled
No, your love is cancelled

(Just) Look at who you are
Thinkin' you're a star
Try and hold me back, breakin' from your pack

Just look at what you've done
Got me on the run
You hurt my pride, took me for a ride

(Just) Look at who you are
Thinkin' you're a star
Try and hold me back, breakin' from your pack

Just look at what you've done
Got me on the run
Took me for a ride, really hurt my pride

Your love is cancelled
Your love is cancelled
Don't get mad, your love is cancelled
'Cause your reading's bad
Your love is cancelled
