Do, do, do, do, do
Doin' that thing to me
Do, do, do, do, do
Doin' it

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

There's a magic
Only you posses
Cast your spell
A master of the kiss

Whisk me away
To another time and place
Uh - Huh
Uh - Huh

Like Eve to the Apple
Some things

I'm powerless to resist

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

A modern day Merlin
Who looks through my own eyes
You understand
Don't even have to trust

Some tell us of a Cinderella
(Uh huh, Uh huh)
But oh you're my Prince Charming
One kiss from you changed my hole life

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)
