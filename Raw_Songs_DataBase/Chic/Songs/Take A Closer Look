Take a closer look at my love
Take a closer look at my love
I'm sure that you're gonna see
Our love will last an eternity
Take a closer took at my love

Ooh, Baby

You think love is an open door
You come and go when you want to score
You take my love, then you run away
Denyin' yourself another sunny day
Just stay and see the night through
We'll make love in the mornin' new
It's time that we settle down
No better love can be found

Take a closer look at my love
Take a closer look at my love
I'm sure that you're gonna see
Our love will last an eternity
Take a closer took at my love

Well now you see that there's more to me
I want the love that you've kept from me
In return I'll share my love with you
So tell me what you're gonna do

Listen, baby, here's your last chance
Please give my love a second glance
'Cause lovin' you brings such happiness
A new thrill with each caress

Take a closer look at my love
Take a closer look at my love
I'm sure that you're gonna see
Our love will last an eternity
Take a closer took at my love
