Take it off, all off
Your package is nice but I've got to look twice
To find the real you
Your Calvins fit sung but I don't think
They hug you like I do
Now I understand the clothes don't make a man
So I'll take them off

Take it off, all off
What's the deal
How can you make me feel like a novice

I don't know what you do
When I'm so close to you
But don't stop it
My heart palpitates 'cause your body looks great
When you take it off

Take it off, all off, take it all off
Take it off, all off, take it all off

To feel your body all night love

Makin' love just can't be wrong
Keep the feelin' comin' strong
You make my heart palpitate

'Cause your body looks so great
When you take it off

Take it off, all off, take it all off
Take it off, all off, take it all off
