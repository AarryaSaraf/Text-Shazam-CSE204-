Tell 'em
Stefflon is a bad chick
Tell 'em, tell 'em
A bad chick


Said it's Friday night
Yeah, the weekend's here
And I know you know my routine, baby
You ain't got no fear
But it's okay 'cause you're living so good
Yeah, it feels so right

But when that liquors in our system
Baby, we on a different rhythm all day
And when you dancing to the music
I know that you're gonna lose it
Oh baby

She only loves me when she's sober
She only loves me when she's sober

Tryna get a little closer but you're pushing me away
I hate to stand to look at you as you go on your way
But it's okay, baby, it's all good
'Cause the weekend's over, you'll be back just like you should

But when that liquors in our system
Baby, we on a different rhythm all day
And when you dancing to the music
I know that you're gonna lose it
Oh baby

She only loves me when she's sober
She only loves me when she's sober


I'm rolling through the jungle, it's a madness to London
Step up, Stefflon is a bad chick
Who want it? You don't really want it
'Cause I keep 'em humming, keep 'em coming, keep 'em runnin'
And I run up, step up
Stefflon wet up the place, get mad
Get wicked and wile out
Every time I come, runner run up


She only loves me when she's sober
She only loves me when she's sober
She only loves me when she's sober
She only loves me when she's sober
