I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh

I sit night and day
Just singin' my life sway
And every mornin' when I get up
Before I fill my cup,
I sing my melody
Sounds so good to me
Dancin', singin'
Feels so good to me, damn

I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh

I'm havin' a love attack
Feels so good, matter of fact
My music, and you, boy
You make my dreams come true
Got me singin' a pretty melody
Dancin', singin'
Feels so good to me, that

I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
I'm tellin' you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
