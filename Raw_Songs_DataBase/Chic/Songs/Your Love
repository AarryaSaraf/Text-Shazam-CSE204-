The key that sets me free
To be what I can be
With full intensity

When your name, I speak
Sometimes my soul gets week
All my eyes can see
Is you

In a world with me

In a world with me, yeaheah
In a world with me

There's one thing I know
I'll follow where you go
Till the end of time
You'll always be mine
