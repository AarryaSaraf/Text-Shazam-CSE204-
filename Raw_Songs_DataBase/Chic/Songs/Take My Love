Late in the evening
During the summertime
Desire is so hot!
Fell my temperature climb

Hot to the touch
Sweet lover's bite
Burns like a flame
Beneath my skin, outta sight

All I know is
I just want to love you
All over and over

Take my love
Please, take my love
Take my love
Take my love

Take my love
Please, take my love
Take my love
Take my love

Gonna love you so hard
Don't be afraid
They'll be no stoppin'
Until love's price is paid

In full with interest
Here's the bottom line
I'm sure my securities
Will bring you peace of mind

All I know is
I just want to love you
All over and over

Take my love
Please, take my love
Take my love
Take my love

Take my love
Please, take my love
Take my love
Take my love

All I know is
I just want to love you
All over and over

Take my love
Please, take my love
Take my love
Take my love

Take my love
Please, take my love
Take my love
Take my love

Take my love
Won't you please take my love?
Take my love
Take my love

Take my love
Won't you please take my love?
Take my love
Take my love

Take my love
Take my love
Take my love
Take my love
