// Stage Fright //

My stage fright holds back me all night
Stage fright

My stage fright holds back me all night
Stage fright, it's down right mind boggling
My stage fright

Ten thousand eyes stare down upon me
Five thousand handsome viewers
Make me feel a tingle in my spine
The light are bright and so adorning
They hypnotise and make me realize
That things'll work out just fine

My stage fright holds back me all night
Stage fright, it's down right mind boggling
My stage fright

The people's screams are like injections
Of magic stimulation, fascination
Hits me right on time
Once I get out there, gonna show them

That pound for pound
There's no one else around
I'm puttin' it on the line

My stage fright holds back me all night
Stage fright, it's down right mind boggling
My stage fright

My stage fright holds back me all night
Stage fright, it's down right mind boggling
My stage fright

The people's screams are like injections
Of magic stimulation, fascination
Hits me right on time
Once I get out there, gonna show them

My stage fright holds back me all night
Stage fright, it's down right mind boggling
My stage fright

My stage fright holds back me all night
Stage fright, it's down right mind boggling
My stage fright

My stage fright

// Burn Hard //

Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard
Work out, work out
Brahms gonna do the charm
Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard

When the music calls, it's like your ten feet tall
A song can take you far away from day to day

Let's drink to it, hold to it
(Burn hard today, today get smart)
Let's refine and free fine and moonshine
(Smart as a fox)

Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard
Work out, work out
Brahms gonna do the charm
Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard

I know the world has changed
But some things are the same
Like COD's and SOB's and ABC's

Let's drink to it, hold to it
(Burn hard today, today get smart)
Let's refine and free fine and moonshine
(Smart as a fox)

Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard
Work out, work out
Brahms gonna do the charm
Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard

Burn hard, slap your bass
Burn hard, slap your bass

Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard
Work out, work out
Brahms gonna do the charm
Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard

Burn hard today, today get smart
Smart as a fox, a fox you say

Burn hard, slap your bass

// So Fine //

So fine, so fine to me

'Cause you're so fine
So fine to me, so fine

So fine, so fine to me
So fine, so fine to me

So fine, so fine to me

So fine, 'cause you're so fine
So fine, so fine to me

// Flash Back //

Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin' and plenty pleasin'
Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin'

Allow me to take you back and attempt
To satisfy my curiousity
Please tell me where to place the blame
The responsibility for the change, very strange

Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin' and plenty pleasin'
Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin'

I've been thinkin' about
The good times we shared
Just getting high from the memory
You were always there, so willing to care
Now you're gone, I'm alone

Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin' and plenty pleasin'
Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin'

Flash back, a few years in time
Maybe then you will find
That the reason for the pleasin' was the teasin'

Now come on, get off and get used to it, my dear
Let the music possess you
And make love to your ears

Come on back, come on back
My sweet sexy love
Come on back, sweet love

Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin' and plenty pleasin'
Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin'

// Telling Lies //

Telling lies is your hobby
And you don't give a damn about the truth

Telling lies is your hobby
And you don't give a damn about the truth

You're just like Pinocchio
Every time you tell one
Now you know it grows
Why don't you stop this foolishness
I can't tolerate any more of this
Now you know it's late
You keep tellin' me lies, I'm on ice

Telling lies is your hobby
And you don't give a damn about the truth

Runnin', hidin', slippin', slidin'
Always abidin' by your own rules
You won't win, you'll find there's no escape
You can't run this time
This time you'll pay for your crime
All I want is the truth but you keep on

Telling lies is your hobby
And you don't give a damn about the truth

Why won't you, why won't you
Why won't you try to tell the truth

// Your Love Is Cancelled //

Watchin' the late show
I made up my mind, oh
A love that is free like a love should be
Fallin' behind, oh
Don't you see you are the one
I couldn't have begun
No, your love is cancelled
No, your love is cancelled

(Just) Look at who you are
Thinkin' you're a star
Try and hold me back, breakin' from your pack

Just look at what you've done
Got me on the run
Took me for a ride, really hurt my pride

Well I saw it on TV 'bout someone like me
You just couldn't wait till I feel for you
To start your deceiving
It's the truth, you're not the one
I shouldn't have begun
No, your love is cancelled
No, your love is cancelled

(Just) Look at who you are
Thinkin' you're a star
Try and hold me back, breakin' from your pack

Just look at what you've done
Got me on the run
You hurt my pride, took me for a ride

(Just) Look at who you are
Thinkin' you're a star
Try and hold me back, breakin' from your pack

Just look at what you've done
Got me on the run
Took me for a ride, really hurt my pride

Your love is cancelled
Your love is cancelled
Don't get mad, your love is cancelled
'Cause your reading's bad
Your love is cancelled

// Would You Be My Baby //

Could you be my, be my baby
Don't you tell me no or maybe
If you won't I will go crazy
Be my baby

When a woman like me boy
Says there's gonna be, boy

Between us something beautiful
Listen, open up your heart and let me in
Feel the way I love you
I love you so madly and I'll go crazy
Maybe all night, baby, yes and day

Could you be my, be my baby
Don't you tell me no or maybe
If you won't I will go crazy
Be my baby

When the sky starts falling
That's when I'll start calling
I want you so badly so why can't you
Just comply with my needs
Think of how I say that I love you
I love you cause your beautiful
And if I could I know that I'd
Love you till the end

Could you be my, be my baby
Don't you tell me no or maybe
If you won't I will go crazy
Be my baby

Oh why don't you come on and be, yeah
Why don't you come on and be, yeah
Why don't you come on and be

Could you be my, be my baby
Don't you tell me no or maybe
If you won't I will go crazy
Be my baby

// Take It Off //

Take it off, all off
Your package is nice but I've got to look twice
To find the real you
Your Calvins fit sung but I don't think
They hug you like I do
Now I understand the clothes don't make a man
So I'll take them off

Take it off, all off
What's the deal
How can you make me feel like a novice

I don't know what you do
When I'm so close to you
But don't stop it
My heart palpitates 'cause your body looks great
When you take it off

Take it off, all off, take it all off
Take it off, all off, take it all off

To feel your body all night love

Makin' love just can't be wrong
Keep the feelin' comin' strong
You make my heart palpitate

'Cause your body looks so great
When you take it off

Take it off, all off, take it all off
Take it off, all off, take it all off

// Just Out Of Reach //

I want a love that's mine all mine, all the time
You keep it just out of reach
I want a love that's mine all mine
You keep it just out of reach

She arrives all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
Oh but soon, soon the tears will swell
Makin' it here seems such a cinch
But soon she'll smell the stench
Of the gutter-dwellers, them pretty fellows

I want a love that's mine all mine, all the time
You keep it just out of reach
I want a love that's mine all mine

I sit alone and wonder why
Sweet love just pass me by
Is there someone out there who wants to try
I'll protect you, girl I never will neglect you
Just slip on this ring and
I will make your heart sing, my love

I want a love that's mine all mine, all the time
You keep it just out of reach
I want a love that's mine all mine
You keep it just out of reach

I want a love that's mine all mine, all the time
You keep it just out of reach
I want a love that's mine all mine

I want a love that's mine all mine
But you keep it out of reach
I want a love that's mine all mine
But you keep it out of reach
