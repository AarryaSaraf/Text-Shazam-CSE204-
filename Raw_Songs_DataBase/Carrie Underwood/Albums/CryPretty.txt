Album: CryPretty

// Cry Pretty //

I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

Oh no, you can't dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woo
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby
Oh yeah, woo, woo
No, you can't cry pretty, yeah

// Ghosts On The Stereo //

You think I'm crying over you
You think I'm dying too
You think I'm thinking way too much
And sadly out of touch
With all the world and all my friends, well, think what you want and think again, think again

'Cause what you don't know is I'm throwin' a party
And everybody tonight is feelin' alright, with some Jack in their Coke
The records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'
There ain't no last call, I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones
No, I ain't alone
I feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo

There ain't no lights on, the curtains drawn
Just one car in the drive
And the neighbors might think it's a haunted house, yeah
But I've never felt so alive

'Cause what they don't know is I'm throwin' a party
And everybody tonight is feelin' alright, with some Jack in their Coke
The records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'
There ain't no last call, I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones
No, I ain't alone
I feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo
With my ghosts on the stereo

One song at a time, I get their advice
And the pain melts away like whiskey on ice

Baby, you don't know that I'm throwin' a party
And everybody tonight is feelin' alright, with some Jack in their Coke
Yeah, the records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'
There ain't no last call, I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones
No, I ain't alone
I feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo
Oh, yeah, with my ghosts on the stereo
Yeah
Oh, yeah, I've got my ghosts on the stereo

// Low //

Like a cigarette without a light
Like a whippoorwill without the night
A broken buzz that's lost its high
Oh, baby, that's what I feel like

I'm so low
I'm so low

Like a diamond ring without a stone
Like a guitar without a song
Everything that was right is wrong
Ever since, baby, you been gone

I'm so low
I'm so low
Yeah, I'm low and blue
I'm so lonesome for you

Oh, yeah
Oh, whoa, oh
Yeah, yeah

Oh, I've hit rock bottom, I'm in it deep
I can't get no air, I can't get no sleep, without you by my side
I tried to see the light, baby, but I can't
'Cause way down here in the world where I am, the sun don't shine

'Cause I'm low, low, low, low
I'm so low
I'm so tangled up and blue
I'm so lonesome for you
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm so lonesome for you
Yeah, I'm lonesome for you

// Backsliding //

I'm not supposed to be thinking 'bout you, lying here in this bed
Too much has gone wrong and we should move on
That's what we both said
There's a million reasons why we said goodbye
Why we couldn't try, couldn't fight for it anymore
Put your ring in the back of the dresser drawer
And we closed that door

So why am I 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone
And you're standin' in my porch light
Backsliding
Wearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin', it feels so right
Backsliding
We say we won't, but then we do
The same old thing, fallin' right back in
Say it's gonna be the last time
Backsliding, I'm backsliding
Backsliding, I'm backsliding

Well, I heard that you've been hangin' around with someone new
Yeah, word gets around in such a small town
Bet you heard I'm seein' someone too
There's a million reasons why we should be happy
Not lookin' back, livin' in the past anymore
But they ain't addin' up, I guess they ain't enough
'Cause here I am

At 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone
And you're standin' in my porch light
Backsliding
Wearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin', it feels so right
Backsliding
We say we won't, but then we do
The same old thing, fallin' right back in
Say it's gonna be the last time
Backsliding, I'm backsliding
Backsliding, I'm backsliding

And we keep pushing, pulling back, sliding
Pushing, pulling, slipping back, sliding
I keep asking myself, keep asking myself
Why do I need you and nobody else?
And if we're not meant to be, then why do we keep backsliding?

And why am I 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone
And you're standin' in my porch light
Backsliding
Wearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin', it feels so right
Backsliding
We say we won't, oh, but then we do
Yeah, the same old thing, fallin' right back in
Say it's gonna be the last time
Backsliding, I'm backsliding
Yeah, yeah
I'm backsliding, yeah
Backsliding

Why do we keep backsliding?
I can't help it, I'm backsliding
I need you, I'm backsliding
Why do we keep backsliding?
Backsliding
Backsliding
Backsliding
Backsliding

// Southbound //

We got a pontoon boat with a Yamaha
People dressed like they're in Panama
Small town, spring break
Every weekend 'round this place
And there's a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
And those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
Tan lines and gas station cheap sunglasses
They're coming here from all around

To get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound

Bo got a ticket in a no-wake zone
But Katie's the one that should take it slow
'Cause she's dancin' on the dock and it's only 2 o'clock
Yeah, the fish ain't bitin' 'cause the party's on
The old men are thinkin' 'bout goin' home
But those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah

We're gonna get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah
Woo!

Yeah, we got the rope swing swingin' like a chandelier
Little bit of heaven on the water ride here
Don't need much, just a couple of beers and you and me
Gotta love this time of year
Getting southbound, southbound

So let's get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Let's get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah

// That Song That We Used To Make Love To //

Don't wanna hear that stupid melody
The one we used to always keep playing on repeat
'Cause it just takes me to the place when you were mine
Where you laid my body down, and then got drunk on me like wine
Don't wanna feel that bass rattle in my bones
'Cause once I do, I know it won't leave me alone
It haunts me, baby, it does me wrong
But still, I just can't make myself delete it from my phone

That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know, I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song that we made love to
That we made love to, yeah

I know I'm contradicting everything I said
But I wanna turn it up when I'm lyin' in this bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Drift off dreamin', baby, go on, let it take my breath

That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song (That song, that song)
That we made love to (That song, that song)
That we made love to, yeah

Me and you, you and me
On repeat, on repeat
Me and you, you and me
On repeat, on repeat

That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It breaks me, it makes me
Wanna hear it again and again and again
That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song (That song, that song)
That we made love to (That song, that song)
That we made love to, yeah

That song, that song, that song
That song, that song, that song
That song, that song, that song
That song that we made love to, that we made love to, yeah

// Drinking Alone //

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight's the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should

We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone

I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home

We should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Drinking alone, drinking alone) together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

We should be drinking alone
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh

// The Bullet //

Line of limousines leaves one by one
The prayers been prayed, the hymns been sung
Black mascara's already run
But the tears keep flowin'
You can blame it on hate or blame it on guns
But mama's ain't supposed to bury their sons
Left a hole in her heart and it still ain't done
The bullet keeps on goin'

Through every branch of his family tree
Every birthday that he'll never see
Every chance to live a good life that was stolen
Through the son he'll never get to raise
His daughter on her wedding day
Wishin' it was his hands she was holdin'
'Till every heart that's left to break is broken
The bullet keeps on goin'

The grass grows back around the stone
And friends stop checkin' in on the phone
The camera crews have all moved on
But the wound's still open
The bullet keeps on goin'

Through every branch of his family tree
Every birthday that he'll never see
Every chance to live a good life that was stolen
Through the son he'll never get to raise
His daughter on her wedding day
Wishin' it was his hands she was holdin'
'Till every heart that's left to break is broken
The bullet keeps on goin', yeah
Oh, whoa

Line of limousines leaving one by one
The prayers been prayed, the hymns been sung
Oh, mama's ain't supposed to bury their sons
The bullet keeps on goin'

Through the son he'll never get to raise
His daughter on her wedding day
Wishin' it was his hands she was holdin'
'Till every heart that's left to break is broken
The bullet keeps on goin'
The bullet keeps on goin'

// Spinning Bottles //

She's waiting, praying that he don't drive tonight
She's pacing the floor, she's checking the time
Wondering how the glow with that porch light hasn't gone out
'Cause it's been on now for three days straight
He's been nowhere to be found
Probably drowning in the neon, where the wagon broke down
She called up his mama and his friends in town
But they ain't seen him
Another night of no sleepin'

Round and around and around they go
Will it end? Nobody knows
She's all cried out on the kitchen floor
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

He's in a hotel room with the TV on
Gettin' lost in the static with the curtains drawn
Knowin' this could be the time that gets her gone for good
He'd quit if he could
But one down, two down, three down, four
Can't even recognize the man in the mirror anymore

Oh, 'round and around and around they go
Will it end? Nobody knows
He's passed out on the bathroom floor
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

This ain't a game
Nobody wins
Yeah, nobody gets lucky when that bottle spins
Again and again, again and again, again and again

So, 'round and around and around they go
Will this end? Nobody knows
Can't live like this anymore
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles
Yeah, spinnin' bottles
Spinnin' bottles

// Love Wins //

A stray bullet and a mama cries
Her baby won't be coming home tonight
Sirens screaming down the avenue
Just another story on the evening news, oh, whoa
Politics and prejudice
How the hell'd it'd ever come to this?
When everybody's gotta pick a side
It don't matter if you're wrong or right, no
And so it goes, but I hold onto hope and I won't let go 'cause

I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

Sometimes it takes a lot of faith
To keep believing there will come a day
When the tears and the sadness, the pain and the hate
The struggle, this madness, will all fade away, yeah

I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

Love is power, love is a smile
Love reaches out, love is the remedy
Love is the answer, love's an open door
Love is the only thing worth fighting for, yeah

I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins
Oh, yeah, love wins

Love will, love can, love still, love wins
Love will, love can, love still, love wins

// End Up With You //

I don't really care 'bout making any plans
Leave it up in the air, give it up to chance
Seein' where it goes, seein' where it lands
I just wanna go as fast as we can

And we could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Yeah, all I wanna do is end up with you

To the end of the world if you wanted to
Yeah, 'cause you could light up the dark side of the moon
Don't leave it up to me, I'll leave it up to you
'Cause I just want one thing when the night is through, yeah

We could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Yeah, all I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you

We could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you

End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you, you, you, you

// Kingdom //

It's two kids flying down the hall in the morning into our bedroom
It's a creaky board on the front porch
You swear you're gonna fix it soon
It's a kitchen table where we say our prayers
Give a little thanks to the man upstairs
It's the feeling I get, baby, when I look at you

It ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
This is our kingdom

It's been late nights, a few good fights
Wouldn't sleep until we worked things out
It's been long days of leanin' on faith
Even when we had our doubts
Barely gettin' by, stretched to the limits
All the hard times, no, I wouldn't trade a minute
We've come so far, it made us who we are
Right here, right now

It ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
And this is our kingdom
This is our, this is our, this is our kingdom
Oh, yeah, this is our kingdom

No, it ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
This is our kingdom
Oh, yeah
This is our, this is our kingdom
This is our kingdom

It's our names carved out on that old oak tree
Pictures on the wall of you and me
It's our heart, it's our home, it's our babies faces
It's the light, it's the love living in this place
It's church on Sunday, tire swings
Good and the bad times
Praying on our knees
Thanking the lord for this beautiful life
The love we have built will stand the test of time, yeah

Oh, this is our kingdom
This is our kingdom, yeah
This is our kingdom
It's pictures on the wall of you and me
Thanking the lord, praying on our knees
In our kingdom
