Album: PlayOn

// Cowboy Casanova //

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You're running, you're trying, you're trying to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You'll get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again, 'cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away-ay-ay
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe, but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice

He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

Run, run away
Don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember

He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life
(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life

// Quitter //

Here's how it goes
Boy meets girl, girl leaves boy
That's all I know
All I've done, all my life

'Cause throughout my history
I've only been with jerks
Who couldn't take it
But you see the picket fence
A swing on the front porch
With us two on it

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'Til now, I've always been a quitter

You rescued me
Saved my life just in time
Saw past all my issues and scars
And made me try

'Cause oh, the way you're kissing me
Makes it hard to breathe
But I still like it
Oh-oh, it truly feels like a dream
You know exactly how I want it

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'Til now, I've always been a quitter

I've always been a quitter

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'Til now, I've always been a quitter

I've always been a quitter

// Mama's Song //

Mama, you taught me to do the right things
So now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life

And I know you watched me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer to your prayers

And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

Mama, there's no way you'll ever lose me
Giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes

'Cause he is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

And when I watch my baby grow up
I only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find the answer to our prayers
And that she'll say

He is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

Mama, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

// Change //

What you gonna do with the thirty-six cents
Sticky with coke on your floorboard
When a woman on the street is huddled in the cold
On a sidewalk bench trying to keep warm
Do you call her over, hand her the change
Ask her story, ask her her name?
Or do you tell yourself

"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"

Oh, what you gonna do when you're watching TV
And an ad comes on, yeah, you know the kind
Flashing up pictures of a child in need
For a dime a day, you could save a life
Do you call the number, reach out a hand
Or do you change the channel, call it a scam?
Do you tell yourself

"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Don't listen to 'em when they say
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, don't listen to 'em when they say
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"

The world's so big, it can break your heart
And you just wanna help, not sure where to start
So you close your eyes
And send up a prayer into the dark

"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Don't listen to 'em when they say
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, don't you listen to 'em when they say
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"

// Undo It //

I should've known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes, and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide

Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name, and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw 'em in the trash
And I'm not even sad

Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
Oh no, you'll never change

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na na

You want my future, you can't have it
I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

// Someday When I Stop Loving You //

One foot on the bus, 'bout half past nine
I knew that you were leavin' this time
I thought about layin' down in its path
Thinking that you might get off for that
I remember that night we laid in bed
Namin' all our kids that we hadn't had yet
One for your grandma and one for mine
Said we'd draw straws when it came time

I'll move on, baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailin' ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you

I bet all I had on a thing called love
I guess in the end, it wasn't enough
And it's hard to watch you leave right now
I'm gonna have to learn to let you go somehow
Somehow

I'll move on, baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailin' ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you

Ooh
Oh someday
Yeah, someday

I'll move on, baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailin' ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop lovin' you

Someday when I stop lovin' you
Ooh

// Songs Like This //

Wanna find some boy, rip his heart right out
First man I see, gonna take him down
It ain't the Christian thing
To do, they say
But someone, somewhere's gotta pay

And if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong
I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this

Broke my TV, pawned my guitar
After maxin' out my credit cards
You lied much too much, and you lied again
Caught you on the couch with my best friend

And if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong
I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
Now if it wasn't for guys like you

There wouldn't be songs like this one
That tell the whole world just what a jerk you are

And if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong
I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
Well, if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this

No, if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this

// Temporary Home //

Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad
Another school, another house that will never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home

Young mom, on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a half-way house will never be a home
At night, she whispers to her baby girl
"Someday we'll find our place here in this world"

This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is our temporary home

Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers, "Don't cry for me, I'll see you all someday"
He looks up and says, "I can see God's face"

This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home

This is our temporary home

// This Time //

Maybe it's the way that the stars are aligned
That's makin' me feel this way tonight
Maybe it's the words you left unsaid
Maybe it's the stardust in my hand

But I wanna tell ya
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah
I can't wait another minute
Life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time, baby

Maybe it's the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
That's making all the pieces fit
Making it all make perfect sense

But I wanna tell ya
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah
I can't wait another minute
Oh, life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time, baby
Ooh, yeah

It goes by so fast
Can't get it back
There ain't no time like this time

Yeah, I just wanna tell ya
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah
And I can't wait another minute
Oh, life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time, baby
My little baby
Maybe it's the way that the stars are aligned
And there ain't no time
Ain't no time
Ain't no time like this time, baby
Ooh, yeah

Maybe it's the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
Yeah, yeah

// Look At Me //

I would bet my life, like I bet my heart
That you were the one, baby
I've never been so sure of anything before
You're drivin' my heart crazy
I can't hold out, I can't hold back now
Like I've done before

Darling, look at me
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling, can't you see?
I'd do anything you want me to

I tell myself, I'm in too deep
Then I fall a little farther
Every time you look at me

How do you do that, babe?
Make me feel like I'm the only girl alive for you
I don't know what it is that makes me fall like this
First time in your arms, I knew
The way you held me, I knew that this could be
What I've been waiting to find

Darling, look at me
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling, can't you see?
I'd do anything you want me to

I tell myself I'm getting in too deep
Then I fall a little farther
Every time you look at me

Every time you look at me

// Unapologize //

Last night, I was pourin' out my heart
Like a waterfall to you
And with one kiss, I was a runaway train
Flyin' off the track to you
"I love you" came floodin' out
Couldn't make it stop, couldn't shut my mouth
I felt like a fool when I lied and said I was sorry
But

I unapologize, I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I can't unsay what you heard
'Cause you heard me right
And I won't try to fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize

You know, people say a lot of things
That they don't really mean
And last night, I told a little white lie
Hoping you'd forget the scene
Where it felt like a movie under that porch light
Couldn't help myself when you held me tight
Said what I meant, then I lied and said I was sorry

I unapologize, I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I can't unsay what you heard
'Cause you heard me right
And I won't try to fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize

Oh, there's no time to be
Holdin' it all and tryin' to pretend
That I don't feel anything
Oh, I shouldn't've said I'm sorry

I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I can't unsay what you heard
'Cause you heard me right and I won't try to fight 'em back
Or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize

'Cause you heard me right, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I unapologize

// What Can I Say //

[Carrie Underwood:]
Piercing words, eyes are red
Watched your tail lights in the rain
Empty heart filled with regret
I know we were both to blame

And I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
So I said all I had to say
In letters that I threw away

And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it's been so long, it's never easy
It's like trying to spin the world the other way
What can I say?

[Ashley Clark with Carrie Underwood:]
How did it come to this?
I think about you all the time
It's no excuse, but I wish
That I never made you cry

I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
I couldn't find the words to say

And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it's been so long, it's never easy
It's like trying to spin the world the other way
So what can I say? What can I say?
What can I say? What can I say?

I hate to think all you had of me
(I said all I had to say)
Is a memory I left you
The space between what was meant to be
(In letters that I threw away)
And the mess that it turned into

And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it's been so long, it's never easy
It's like trying to spin the world the other way
It is like trying to spin the world the other way
What can I say?
What can I say?
What can I say?

// Play On //

What you gonna do when the show is over?
What you gonna sing when the song ends? Yeah, yeah
How you gonna cope when there is no closure?
Where you gonna reach when the goal gets higher?
How you gonna make it through
When you think you lost your chance?

Play on, when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on

Even when the floodgates swing wide open
Never let the current sink you down, no
Even when you're not sure where you're goin'
Swimming through a mess and you can't get out
Just going through the motions, and tryin' not to drown

Play on, when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on

Even through a storm on the darkest night
Don't you ever give up the fight
Even when you feel you're all alone
Play on, play on

Play on, when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on
