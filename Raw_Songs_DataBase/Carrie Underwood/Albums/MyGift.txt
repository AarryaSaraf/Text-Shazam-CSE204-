// Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee //

Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Opening to the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light of day

All Thy works with joy surround Thee
Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays
Stars and angels sing around Thee
Center of unbroken praise
Field and forest, vale and mountain
Flowery meadow, flashing sea
Chanting bird and flowing fountain
Call us to rejoice in Thee

Mortals, join the happy chorus
Which the morning stars began
Father love is reigning o'er us
Brother love binds man to man
Ever singing, march we onward
Victors in the midst of strife
Joyful music leads us sunward
In the triumph song of life
Joyful music leads us sunward
In the triumph song of life

// O Come All Ye Faithful //

O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant!
O come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord!

Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above!
Glory to God
All glory in the highest
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord!

Yes, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning
Jesus, to Thee be glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord!

// Let There Be Peace //

Let there be peace
Peace to every nation
Let there be hope
For all the world to see
Let there be love
And joy to all the children
Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me

If I had one wish on my Christmas list
It wouldn't be for presents under my tree
They'd be no more tears for crying
No more wars for fighting
And every mother's child would have enough to eat

So when I get down on my knees to pray
I ask the Lord above to light the way

And let there be peace
Peace to every nation
Let there be hope
For all the world to see
Let there be love
And joy to all the children
Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me

When I look in the mirror, all I wanna see
Is true compassion looking back at me
I wanna, I wanna love my neighbor
And be the hands and feet of
Jesus, take his love to the least of these

All I'm asking to be the change
When I get down on my knees, I say:

Let there be peace
Peace to every nation
Let there be hope
For all the world to see
Let there be love
And joy to all the children
Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me

Let there be peace
Let there be love
Let there be joy
For you and me
Let there be peace
Let there be love
Let there be joy
For you and me
For you and me

Let there be peace
Peace to every nation
Let there be hope
For all the world to see
Let there be love
And joy to all the children
Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me
(Peace)
(Peace to every nation)
Let there be hope
For all the world to see
Let there be love
And joy to all the children
Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me
(Peace on Earth)
For you and me

Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me

// Sweet Baby Jesus //

I wonder were you cold that night
Lying there by Mary's side
Taking your first breath
I wonder were you scared to death

Fully human, fully God
Full of wonder and the blood
That one day you would shed to save the world
Tiny feet and tiny hands
With all the earth at their command
It must have felt strange to you

Sweet Baby Jesus
Come down to love us
To lie in a manger
So far from home
You could have left us
Helpless and so lost
But you chose to save us
Sweet Baby Jesus

The first time Mary held you close
All wrapped up in tattered clothes
Did you see tears fall from her eyes
Just a mother holding her first child

Fully human, fully God
Full of wonder and the blood
That one day you would shed to save the world
Tiny feet and tiny hands
With all the earth at their command
Oh, it must have been strange to you

Sweet Baby Jesus
Come down to love us
To lie in a manger
So far from home
Oh, you could have left us
Helpless and so lost
But you chose to save us
Sweet Baby Jesus

Sweet Baby Jesus
Come down to love us
To lie in a manger
To die on a cross
Oh, you could have left us
Helpless and so, so lost
But you chose to save us
Sweet Baby Jesus

Sweet Baby Jesus

// Hallelujah //

Ooh, in the winter's chill
Let the candles light the night up from the windowsills
Ooh, as I draw you near
And we whisper all the sweet sounds only we can hear
On the coldest evening in this December
I hold you in the heat of the glowing embers

Let the world stand still, the church bells ring
Silent night as the angels sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let the magic warm the moonlit air
Hear the choirs join in singing everywhere
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Ooh, let there be peace on earth
Let the lonely join together, let them know their worth
Ooh, let the children know
There's a brighter day ahead, let's hold on to hope
And on the coldest evening in this December
Let us pray the spirit of love will linger

Oh, let the world stand still, the church bells ring
Silent night as the angels sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let the magic warm the moonlit air
Hear the choirs join in singing everywhere
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Glory, glory, glory I'm so glad to have you here
And may this Christmas moment last for years

Let the world stand still, the church bells ring
Silent night as the angels sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let the magic warm the moonlit air
Hear the choirs join in singing everywhere
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

// O Holy Night //

O Holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the Angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night
O night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His Gospel is Peace
Chains shall He break, for his child is our brother
And in His name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us Praise His Holy name
Christ is the Lord; Their name forever praise we
Noel, Noel
O night, O night divine
Noel, Noel
O night, O holy night

// Mary, Did You Know? //

Mmm, yeah, oh

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God

Mary, did you know?
Oh, Mary, did you know?

The blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding
Is the Great I Am

Oh Mary did you know?
Ooh, Mary did you know?
Mmm, Mary did you know?

// Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas //

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let the yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

A merry little Christmas

// Away In A Manger //

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the poor Baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus; Look down from the sky
And stay by my side till morning is nigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And take us to Heaven to live with Thee there

// Silent Night //

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing 'Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth

// Favorite Time Of Year //

Yeah

Break out the tinsel, unpack the lights
We're 'bout to bring on the merry and bright
I hear those jingle bells in the air
Ringing out the sound of joy everywhere

'Tis the season we've been waiting for
(Waiting, don't keep me waiting)
Can't you feel it knocking at your door?
(Knock, knock, it's knocking at your door)

Love pouring out like the snow from the sky
Snuggled up together sitting by the fire
Oh, it's magical, it's my favorite time
Pretty little wishes tied up in a bow
And every little kiss is like we're underneath the mistletoe
It's music to my ears
Christmas is my favorite time of year

Stockings on chimneys, angels on trees
Sugar and cinnamon, it's the little things
Blankets and movies in black and white
Together they make up this colorful life

'Tis the season we've been waiting for
(Waiting, don't keep me waiting)
Oh, can't you feel it knocking at your door?
(Knock, knock, it's knocking at your door)

Love pouring out like the snow from the sky
Snuggled up together sitting by the fire
Oh, it's magical, it's my favorite time
Pretty little wishes tied up in a bow
And every little kiss is like we're underneath the mistletoe
It's music to my ears
Christmas is my favorite time of year

Christmas is my favorite time
Christmas is my favorite time
Christmas is my favorite time
Oh, don't keep me waiting

Love pouring out like the snow from the sky
Snuggled up together sitting by the fire
Oh, it's magical, it's my favorite time
Pretty little wishes tied up in a bow
And every little kiss is like we're underneath the mistletoe
It's music to my ears
Christmas is my favorite time of year
(Christmas is my favorite time of year)

Christmas is my favorite time of year
Oh, yes it is

// All Is Well //

All is well, all is well
Angels and men rejoice
For tonight darkness fell
Into the dawn of love's light
Sing A-le, sing Alleluia

All is well, all is well
Let there be peace on Earth
Christ has come, go and tell
That He is in the manger
Sing A-le, sing Alleluia

All is well, all is well
Lift up your voice and sing
Born is now Emmanuel
Born is our Lord and Savior
Sing Alleluia, sing Alleluia
All is well

Born is now Emmanuel
Born is our Lord and Savior
Sing Alleluia, sing Alleluia
All is well
