// Nothing But The Blood Of Jesus //

What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Oooh, oooh

For my cleansing, this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my pardon is my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Oooh, oooh

Nothing can thy sin erase
This is all my hope and peace
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Ohhh, ohhh, oooh, oooh

// Blessed Assurance //

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine
Heir of salvation, purchase of God
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

Perfect submission, perfect delight
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight
And angels, descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

Ooh-ooh
Mmm, mmm

Perfect submission, all is at rest
I in my Savior am happy and blest
Watching and waiting, looking above
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
Praising my Savior all the day long

// Just As I Am //

Just as I am, without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee
O Lamb of God, I come, I come

Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt
Fighting and fears within, without
O Lamb of God, I come, I come

Ooh ooh, just as I am
Ooh ooh, I come
Ooh ooh, just as I am
Oh Lamb of God I come

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve
Because Thy promise I believe
O Lamb of God, I come, I come

Ooh ooh, just as I am
Ooh ooh, I come
Ooh ooh, just as I am
Oh Lamb of God I come

Oh Lamb of God I come

// Victory In Jesus //

I heard an old, old story, how a Savior came from glory
How He gave His life on Calvary to save a wretch like me
I heard about His groaning, of His precious blood's atoning
Then I repented of my sins and won the victory, yeah

Oh, victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood
He loved me 'ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood

I heard about His healing, of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again and 'caused the blind to see
And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit"
And somehow Jesus came and brought me to the victory

Victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me, and He bought me with His redeeming blood
He loved me 'ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood...

Oh yeah...
Sweet, sweet Jesus...
Mmm...
Oooh...
Mmm...

Yes, victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me, and He bought me with His redeeming blood
He loved me 'ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood

Yes, He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood

// Great Is Thy Faithfulness //

Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father
There is no shadow of turning with Thee

// O How I Love Jesus //

There is a name I love to hear
I love to sing its worth
It sounds like music in my ear
The sweetest name on earth

Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me

It tells me of a Savior's love
Who died and set me free
It tells me of His precious blood
The sinner's perfect plea

Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me
Jesus first loved me

He tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below

Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me, yeah
Because He first loved me

// How Great Thou Art //

O Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
[Album version:] Then I shall bow with humble adoration
[Live version:] Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And then proclaim, "My God, how great Thou art!"

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

// Because He Lives //

God sent His son, they called Him Jesus
He came to love, heal and forgive
He lived and died to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living, just because He lives

How sweet to hold a newborn baby
And feel the pride and joy He gives
But greater still the calm assurance
This child can face uncertain days, because He lives

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living, just because He lives

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living, just because He lives

Ooh, yeah yeah yeah
Because He lives, because He lives
Because He lives, because He lives
Because He lives, because He lives
Because He lives, because He lives
Because He lives, because He lives
Because He lives, because He lives

// The Old Rugged Cross //

On a hill far away, stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
'Til my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see
For 'twas on that old cross, Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
'Til my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

Ooh...
Yeah...

Yes, I'll cherish the old rugged cross
'Til my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

Yes, I'll cherish the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

// I Surrender All //

All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence daily live

I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee
My blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit
Truly knowing that Thou art mine

I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee
My blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Now I feel the sacred flame
Oh the joy of full salvation
Glory, glory to his name

I surrender all
Oh, I surrender all
All to Thee
My blessed Savior
I surrender all

Oh, I surrender all

Oh, I surrender...
Oooh...

// Softly And Tenderly //

Softly and tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portals
He's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me

Come home
Come home
Ye who are weary
Come home
Earnestly, tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling "Oh sinner, come home"

Why should we tarry
When Jesus is pleading
Pleading for you and for me
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies
Mercies for you and for me

Come home
Come home
Ye who are weary
Come home
Earnestly, tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling "Oh sinner, come home"

Oh for the wonderful love He has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me

Come home
Come home
Ye who are weary
Come home
Earnestly, tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling "Oh sinner..."

Come home
Come home
Ye who are weary
Come home
Earnestly, tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling "Oh sinner, come home"

// Amazing Grace //

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Then when we first begun

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
