She smiles at me all pretty
Walkin' up to me down aisle five
I wave and I smile back
And I can feel her eyes on me
She's checking me out in the checkout line
Cabernet in a paper bag

Yeah, and she's the reason
He'll tell me he's working late
And I'll go home and cook him dinner
Pour the wine and sit up and wait, yeah

What she don't know is I know what she's been up to
I bet she thinks she got me played for a fool
But the joke's on her, in that bed she's lyin' in
What she don't know, she don't know
She can have him

And I know what's been going on
Behind closed doors in room 310
From the laundry I've been foldin'
I can still smell that strong cologne
He puts on to hide the Virginia Slim
That she's been smokin'

But there's a cruel world awaitin'
Outside of them motel's sheets
'Cause he'll find himself another Jezebel
And she'll end up just like me, yeah

What she don't know is I know what she's been up to
I bet she thinks she got me played for a fool
But the joke's on her, in that bed she's lyin' in
What she don't know, she don't know
She can have him, she can have him

Yeah she can have this ring I'm slipping off
And this house I'm tired of cleanin'
She can have it all and have a ball
With this worthless piece I'm leaving

What she don't know is I know what she's been up to
I bet she thinks she got me played for a fool
But the joke's on her, in that bed that she's lyin' in
What she don't know, she don't know
Is she can have him
She can have him
Ooh, she can have him
She can have him
