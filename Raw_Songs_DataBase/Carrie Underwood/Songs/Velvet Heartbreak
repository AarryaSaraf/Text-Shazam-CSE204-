(Ooh, ha, ooh)
(Ooh, ha, ooh)

He'll get you comin' apart at the seams
When he calls you baby
He'll get you hangin' on every little stitch
That his lips are sayin'
He's cool, too good to be true
Looks so good on you
You gotta try him on
But don't cut the tags off if you take him home

That velvet heartbreak
Crush you like a fool on a Friday night
Saturday mornin' mistake
Pullin' the wool over your eyes
It's a love you and leave ya, double shot of tequila
Black mascara tears drippin' on ice
So smooth, until it ain't
That velvet heartbreak

It's like a dress in the store that you can't afford
But you gotta have it
It's gonna be a discount rack, can't take it back
Waitin' to happen
Yeah, it's on you, do what you wanna do (Ooh, ooh)
But just know what you're gettin' into (Ooh)
If you slip it on (Ooh, if you slip it on)
The new wears off and it won't take long

That velvet heartbreak
Crush you like a fool on a Friday night
Saturday mornin' mistake
Pullin' the wool over your eyes
It's a love you and leave ya, double shot of tequila
Black mascara tears drippin' on ice
So smooth, until it ain't
That velvet heartbreak
That heartbreak

It's that velvet heartbreak
Crush you like a fool on a Friday night
Saturday mornin' mistake
Pullin' the wool over your eyes
It's a love you and leave ya, double shot of tequila
Black mascara tears drippin' on ice
So smooth, until it ain't
That velvet heartbreak

It's a love ya then a leave ya (Mmm, mmm)
Double shot of a velvet heartbreak
Too good to be true, yeah
Smooth, till it ain't
It's a velvet heartbreak
