Let there be peace
Peace to every nation
Let there be hope
For all the world to see
Let there be love
And joy to all the children
Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me

If I had one wish on my Christmas list
It wouldn't be for presents under my tree
They'd be no more tears for crying
No more wars for fighting
And every mother's child would have enough to eat

So when I get down on my knees to pray
I ask the Lord above to light the way

And let there be peace
Peace to every nation
Let there be hope
For all the world to see
Let there be love
And joy to all the children
Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me

When I look in the mirror, all I wanna see
Is true compassion looking back at me
I wanna, I wanna love my neighbor
And be the hands and feet of
Jesus, take his love to the least of these

All I'm asking to be the change
When I get down on my knees, I say:

Let there be peace
Peace to every nation
Let there be hope
For all the world to see
Let there be love
And joy to all the children
Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me

Let there be peace
Let there be love
Let there be joy
For you and me
Let there be peace
Let there be love
Let there be joy
For you and me
For you and me

Let there be peace
Peace to every nation
Let there be hope
For all the world to see
Let there be love
And joy to all the children
Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me
(Peace)
(Peace to every nation)
Let there be hope
For all the world to see
Let there be love
And joy to all the children
Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me
(Peace on Earth)
For you and me

Let there be peace on Earth
For you and me
