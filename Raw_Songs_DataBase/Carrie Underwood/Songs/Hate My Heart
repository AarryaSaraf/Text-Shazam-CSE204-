I'm free as a bird, no ties
Nothin' keeping my wings from flying high
And going out on the town on a Saturday night
'Cause he's gone, with the wind
And Lord knows I deserve to be flirted with
But the only problem is

I hate my heart right now
Underneath the covers in the dark right now
Wishin' I was sitting in a bar right now
Two drinks in
Makin' me a last call friend
I want my feel-good back
Instead of feeling bad that I can't get past
The fact that I can't love nobody else
I would if I could, but I don't know how
I hate my heart right now

Yeah
I hate my heart right now

I don't want him back, that ain't it
But this thing in my chest just can't forget
It keeps beating for him and it just won't quit

I hate my heart right now
Underneath the covers in the dark right now
Wishin' I was sitting in a bar right now
Two drinks in
Makin' me a last call friend
I want my feel-good back
Instead of feeling bad that I can't get past
The fact that I can't love nobody else
I would if I could, but I don't know how
I hate my heart right now

I hate my heart right now

One day I pray he'll stay out of my head
I keep waiting but it ain't happened yet

I hate my heart right now
Underneath the covers in the dark right now
Wishin' I was sitting in a bar right now
With a tall, dark last call friend
And my feel-good back
Instead of feeling bad that I can't get past
The fact that I can't love nobody else
I would if I could, but I don't know how
I hate my heart right now

I hate my heart right now
Oh yeah
