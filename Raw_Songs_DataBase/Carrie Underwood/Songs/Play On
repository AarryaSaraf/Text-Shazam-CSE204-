What you gonna do when the show is over?
What you gonna sing when the song ends? Yeah, yeah
How you gonna cope when there is no closure?
Where you gonna reach when the goal gets higher?
How you gonna make it through
When you think you lost your chance?

Play on, when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on

Even when the floodgates swing wide open
Never let the current sink you down, no
Even when you're not sure where you're goin'
Swimming through a mess and you can't get out
Just going through the motions, and tryin' not to drown

Play on, when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on

Even through a storm on the darkest night
Don't you ever give up the fight
Even when you feel you're all alone
Play on, play on

Play on, when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on
Play on

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
