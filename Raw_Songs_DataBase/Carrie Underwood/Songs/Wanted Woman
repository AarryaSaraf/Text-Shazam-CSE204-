Still bring me flowers
Tell me I'm beautiful
Even though you know I'm gonna say, "Yeah, right"

You know how to make me laugh
When I'm being impossible
You show me off like I'm the best thing you got

Right song on the radio
Turns you into Romeo
Next thing you know we're making out in the backseat

I feel like a wanted woman
I'm done running when you call me, baby
Baby, you got it
Got my heart locked up
It's criminal, you drive me crazy
The way you kiss me, touch me
Chase me, love me
You know how to make a lady
Feel like a wanted woman
Oh, you know I want you
You know you're wanted too

You know my faults, know my fears, know my tendencies
And still you're never gonna walk out that door
'Cause you're my rock, making all my insecurities
Disappear 'cause you're not keeping score

Baby, you're my better half
Best friend that I ever had
Yeah, I love how you make me feel

Feel like a wanted woman
I'm done running when you call me, baby
Baby, you got it
Got my heart locked up
It's criminal you drive me crazy

The way you kiss me, touch me
Chase me, love me
You know how to make a lady
Feel like a wanted woman
Oh, you know I want you
You know you're wanted too, yeah

Oh, you're all I ever wanted
All that I ever need
Oh, I love the way you make me

Feel like a wanted woman
I'm done running when you call me, baby
Baby, you got it
Got my heart locked up
It's criminal, you drive me crazy
The way you kiss, me touch me
Chase me, love me
You know how to make a lady
Feel like a wanted woman
Boy, you know I want you
You know you're wanted too

You know you're wanted too
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm
