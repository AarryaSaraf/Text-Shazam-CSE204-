Like a cigarette without a light
Like a whippoorwill without the night
A broken buzz that's lost its high
Oh, baby, that's what I feel like

I'm so low
I'm so low

Like a diamond ring without a stone
Like a guitar without a song
Everything that was right is wrong
Ever since, baby, you been gone

I'm so low
I'm so low
Yeah, I'm low and blue
I'm so lonesome for you

Oh, yeah
Oh, whoa, oh
Yeah, yeah

Oh, I've hit rock bottom, I'm in it deep
I can't get no air, I can't get no sleep, without you by my side
I tried to see the light, baby, but I can't
'Cause way down here in the world where I am, the sun don't shine

'Cause I'm low, low, low, low
I'm so low
I'm so tangled up and blue
I'm so lonesome for you
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm so lonesome for you
Yeah, I'm lonesome for you
