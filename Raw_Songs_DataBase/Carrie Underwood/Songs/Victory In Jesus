I heard an old, old story, how a Savior came from glory
How He gave His life on Calvary to save a wretch like me
I heard about His groaning, of His precious blood's atoning
Then I repented of my sins and won the victory, yeah

Oh, victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood
He loved me 'ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood

I heard about His healing, of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again and 'caused the blind to see
And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit"
And somehow Jesus came and brought me to the victory

Victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me, and He bought me with His redeeming blood
He loved me 'ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood...

Oh yeah...
Sweet, sweet Jesus...
Mmm...
Oooh...
Mmm...

Yes, victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me, and He bought me with His redeeming blood
He loved me 'ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood

Yes, He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood
