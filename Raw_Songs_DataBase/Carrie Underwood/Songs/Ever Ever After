Ever ever after

Storybook endings, fairytales coming true
Deep down inside we wanna believe they still do (Still do)
In our secretest heart, it's our favorite part of the story
Let's just admit we all wanna make it too

Ever ever after
If we just don't get it our own way
Ever ever after
It may only be a wish away

Start a new fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve (Ever after)
Sometimes you reach what's real just by making believe
(By making believe)
Unafraid, unashamed
There is a joy to be claimed in this world
You even might wind up being glad to be you

Ever ever after
Though the world will tell you it's not smart
Ever ever after
The world can be yours if you let your heart
Believe in ever after

No wonder your heart feels it's flying
Your head feels it's spinning
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through

To ever ever after
Forever could even start today
Ever ever after
Maybe it's just one wish away
Your ever ever after
Ever ever after
(I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss)

Oh, whoa, whoa
Forever ever after
