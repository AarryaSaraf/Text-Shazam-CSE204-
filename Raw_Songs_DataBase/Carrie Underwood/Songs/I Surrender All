All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence daily live

I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee
My blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit
Truly knowing that Thou art mine

I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee
My blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Now I feel the sacred flame
Oh the joy of full salvation
Glory, glory to his name

I surrender all
Oh, I surrender all
All to Thee
My blessed Savior
I surrender all

Oh, I surrender all

Oh, I surrender...
Oooh...
