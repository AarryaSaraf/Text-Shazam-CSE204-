Like jet black and a Cadillac
Like Tennessee and a bottle of Jack
Dolly and a tape deck on the way back to home sweet home

Like Mama and the kitchen
Cooking supper on the stove
Like a sweet tea and a lemon
We go together like denim and rhinestones

You're the smooth and I'm the shine
We're the neon dancing all night
Denim and rhinestones
You're the cool and I'm the fire
No, we're never going out of style

Like a classic jean jacket
Sparkle on the back, gotta have it
So good, so right, you can't go wrong when you slip it on

Like you and me, nothing missing
Even on our own
But when our lips get to kissing
We're fitting together like denim and rhinestones

You're the smooth and I'm the shine
We're the neon dancing all night
Denim and rhinestones
You're the cool and I'm the fire
No, we're never going out of style

Like the quarter and a jukebox slot
Like the key that turns a lock
Some things don't get any better
Than when they go together, denim and rhinestones

You're the smooth and I'm the shine
We're the neon dancing all night
Denim and rhinestones
You're the cool and I'm the fire
No, we're never going out of style

Like denim, and denim, and denim and rhinestones
Ooh, yeah
Like denim, and denim, and denim and rhinestones
