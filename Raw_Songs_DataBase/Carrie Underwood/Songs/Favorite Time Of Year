Yeah

Break out the tinsel, unpack the lights
We're 'bout to bring on the merry and bright
I hear those jingle bells in the air
Ringing out the sound of joy everywhere

'Tis the season we've been waiting for
(Waiting, don't keep me waiting)
Can't you feel it knocking at your door?
(Knock, knock, it's knocking at your door)

Love pouring out like the snow from the sky
Snuggled up together sitting by the fire
Oh, it's magical, it's my favorite time
Pretty little wishes tied up in a bow
And every little kiss is like we're underneath the mistletoe
It's music to my ears
Christmas is my favorite time of year

Stockings on chimneys, angels on trees
Sugar and cinnamon, it's the little things
Blankets and movies in black and white
Together they make up this colorful life

'Tis the season we've been waiting for
(Waiting, don't keep me waiting)
Oh, can't you feel it knocking at your door?
(Knock, knock, it's knocking at your door)

Love pouring out like the snow from the sky
Snuggled up together sitting by the fire
Oh, it's magical, it's my favorite time
Pretty little wishes tied up in a bow
And every little kiss is like we're underneath the mistletoe
It's music to my ears
Christmas is my favorite time of year

Christmas is my favorite time
Christmas is my favorite time
Christmas is my favorite time
Oh, don't keep me waiting

Love pouring out like the snow from the sky
Snuggled up together sitting by the fire
Oh, it's magical, it's my favorite time
Pretty little wishes tied up in a bow
And every little kiss is like we're underneath the mistletoe
It's music to my ears
Christmas is my favorite time of year
(Christmas is my favorite time of year)

Christmas is my favorite time of year
Oh, yes it is
