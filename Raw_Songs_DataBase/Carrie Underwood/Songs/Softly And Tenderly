Softly and tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portals
He's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me

Come home
Come home
Ye who are weary
Come home
Earnestly, tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling "Oh sinner, come home"

Why should we tarry
When Jesus is pleading
Pleading for you and for me
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies
Mercies for you and for me

Come home
Come home
Ye who are weary
Come home
Earnestly, tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling "Oh sinner, come home"

Oh for the wonderful love He has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me

Come home
Come home
Ye who are weary
Come home
Earnestly, tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling "Oh sinner..."

Come home
Come home
Ye who are weary
Come home
Earnestly, tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling "Oh sinner, come home"
