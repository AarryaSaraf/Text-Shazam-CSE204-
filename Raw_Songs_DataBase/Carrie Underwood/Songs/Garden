Where I come from, those big green pastures
Keep on rollin', they don't disappear
In the middle, there's a man on a big, green tractor
Hopin' it's gonna be a real good year (Gonna be a real good year)

Yeah, this back-home drive's got me reflectin'
Feels like God's askin' me some questions

If your words were seeds that were goin' in the ground
And your love was rain farmers prayed about
If your life was sunlight we all needed
What kinda world would it be?

If you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow?
If you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow? (Ooh)

Would it be warm like Eden or more like a desert?
Would the fruit be sweet or withered and dry?
Would the weeds take over 'cause it's been neglected?
Do your roots run deep, are your branches high?

And if your words were seeds that were goin' in the ground
And your love was rain farmers prayed about
If your life was sunlight we all needed
What kinda world would it be?

If you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow?
If you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow?

Would you plant patience?
Would you keep kindness?
Would there be peace
Ripe on the vine?

If your words were seeds goin' in the ground
And your love was rain farmers prayed about
If your life was sunlight we all needed
What kinda world would it be?

If you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow?
Oh, if you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow? Mmm

(Ooh) What kind of garden would you grow? (Garden would you grow)
(Ooh) Oh, what kind of garden would you grow?
