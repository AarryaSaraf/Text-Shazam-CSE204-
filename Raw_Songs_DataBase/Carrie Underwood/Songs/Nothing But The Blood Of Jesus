What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Oooh, oooh

For my cleansing, this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my pardon is my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Oooh, oooh

Nothing can thy sin erase
This is all my hope and peace
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Ohhh, ohhh, oooh, oooh
