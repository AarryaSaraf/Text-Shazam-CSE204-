You left me standing by the door
You left me standing by the door
I know troubles won't last too long
But give me the strength and courage
To carry on
You left me standing by the door
That was yesterday
You left me standing by the door

Farewell, you bid me in the prison
But a light shone through
Showing me a new horizon
Pain is just a stimulant to make you grow
So I made it through and I think you should know

You left me standing by the door
That was yesterday
You left me standing by the door
I know troubles won't last too long
God give me the strength and courage
To carry on
You left me standing by the door
You left me standing by the door

I was unaware of the chains that had me bound
While you were excited 'bout the new life that was found
I prayed for guidance from above
'Cause I've been forgotten and no one to show me love

You left me standing by the door
You left me standing by the door
