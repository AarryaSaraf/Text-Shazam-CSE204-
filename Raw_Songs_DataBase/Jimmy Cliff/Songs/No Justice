I work all day to find my daily bread
Work so hard to get a roof over my head
But the one's I work with acts like their my masters
When what I refuse I'm more then equal partner

I can't get no justice
Under this system
I can't get no justice in this society
I work day and night to find my daily needs
But freedom is suppressed by another one's greed
Why should serve the one's who control another one's needs?
It's rebellion these kind of actions breeds

I can't get no justice
Under this system
I can't get no justice
In this society

I can't get no justice
Under this system
I can't get no justice
In this society

Why should one be judged by the color of their skin?
Instead of look what it is they show from deep within
If they keep wanting to control what we earn
Run a press around because we're going to burn (going to burn)

I can't get no justice under this system
I can't get me no justice
In this society
I can't get me no justice
Under this system
I can't no justice in this society

I can't get me no justice
Under this system
I can't get no justice
In this society
Yeah, yeah

I can't get no justice under this system
I can't get no justice in this society
I can't get me no justice
Under this system
I can't get no justice in this society
