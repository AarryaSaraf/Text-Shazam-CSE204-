I am born to win
I am born to win
I've been lost and found, turned upside down
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been cast aside, and been despised
Mmm, mmm, mmm

But I'm Daniel in the lion's den
Jonah in the belly of the whale
I'm not alone, so I cannot fail, no, no, no
And I'm born to win
I am born to win
I am born to win

I've been rejected considered dead
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been accused and been refused
Mmm, mmm, mmm

But the stone that the builder refuse
Shall be the head corner stone
I cannot fail, 'cause I'm not alone, no, no, no
And I'm born to win


Hey, hey, hey, oh yes
Yes I know that

I am born to win
I am born to win

Been lost and found, turned upside down
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been accused and been refused
Mmm, mmm, mmm

But I'm Daniel in the lion's den
Jonah in the belly of the whale
I'm not alone, so I cannot fail, no, no, no
'Cause I'm born to win
Yes, I'm born, born, born to win
I am born, born, born, born to win
I am born to win...
