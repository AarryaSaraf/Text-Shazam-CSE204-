Yes! As I was sayin', I like work, you know.
But when I work I must get paid.
You don't know the sound I'm tryin' to tell you.
Listen! Try to understand! Listen!

My foreparents worked, from sun-up, 'til sun-down.
Peace could not be found now they're under the ground.
I've heard dem complain and cried out in pain.
Seeking peaceful gain under the Sun, Moon and stars.

Won't happen to me. I'm not blind, you see.
I've got to be free. I want it right here on Earth.
Got to have some fun, 'for my life is done.
Let happiness run under the Sun, Moon and stars.

Under the Sun, under the Moon, under the stars, wherever you are!
Got to have some fun under the Sun, Moon and stars.
Got to get some fun under the Sun, Moon and stars.

Don't wanted on Venus, Saturn nor Uranus.
Don't want it on Pluto, I want it right here on Earth.
Don't want it on Jupiter, Neptune nor on Mercury.
Don't want it on Mars, but under the Sun, Moon and stars.

Under the Sun, under the Moon, under the stars, wherever you are!
Got to have some fun under the Sun, Moon and stars.
Let happiness run under the Sun, Moon and stars.

So you didn't understand what I was tryin to tell you...
Got tell you one more time. Listen!

Under the Sun, under the Moon, under the stars, wherever you are!
Got to have some fun under the Sun, Moon and stars.
Let happiness run under the Sun, Moon and stars.

Got to find some peace under the Sun, Moon and stars.
Each and everyone. Under the Sun, Moon and stars.
