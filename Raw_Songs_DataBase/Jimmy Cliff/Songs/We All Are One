We all are one, we are the same person
I'll be you, you'll be me (Oh, yeah)
We all are one, same universal world
I'll be you, you'll be me

No matter where we are born,
We are human beings
The same chemistry
Where emotions and feelings
All corresponding in love
Compatible

You can't get around it,
No matter how hard you try
You better believe it
And if you should find out
That you are no different than I

The only difference I can see
Is in the conscience
And the shade of our skin
Doesn't matter, we laugh, we chatter
We smile, we all live for

And the feelings that make
All those faces always renew
So true, so true
And would you believe that I have
All those same feelings too
The same as you

Look at the children, they're having fun
With no regards to why
They all look different but deep inside
Their feelings of love they don't hide, they don't hide
They don't hide, they don't hide
