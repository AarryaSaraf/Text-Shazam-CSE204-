Five o'clock in the morning
I'm not yet a-sleeping
Soon the day will be dawning
Since I broke up with you
My whole world is through
I'm so blue

I should have not been a-flirting
Now I'm the one who is hurting
And there's just no telling
What I'm gonna do
'Cause life without you is so blue

My world is blue
My world is blue, ooh

Help me mama, help me papa
Can't you see I made a mistake?
I'm only living for a loving
And this heartache, I just can't take
I'm so blue

Five o'clock in the morning
I'm not yet a-sleeping
Soon the day will be dawning
Now since I broke up with you
My whole world is through
I'm so blue

You never miss your water
Until your well runs dry
You never see your tears
And then you start to cry
You break down inside you could die

My world is blue
My world is blue, ooh

Help me mama, help me papa
Can't you see I made a mistake?
I'm only living for a loving
And this heartache, I just can't take
I'm so blue

My world is blue, so blue
I need you, ooh, ooh
Come into my world, girl
Said, I need you
I gotta have you
