Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take

Open up your window
Let the love come shinin'
Open up your shadow
Let the love come burnin'

Loving you is the best thing I can do
You loving me, well, you know you set me free
Set me free, yeah

Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take

Will to fly was a thing
Money could buy
Then you know the rich would live
And the poor would die

Still I love the rich
But they're yet so lonely
And I love the poor
'Cause there stood so many
Stood so many, yeah

Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take

Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, baby

I can give you what I got 
Oh, your mind think a lot
I will take just what you got
If you say that's what you got

I know some day no matter what they say
Money will come, money will come our way
In a million billion ways
Zillion ways, no, no

Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I got to give
To give and take

Oh, yes, oh, yes
It's so good when you dub it up, dub it up
'Cause all I got to give and what I got to give is blood
I'll give it to you

Love is all I got to give
To give and take
