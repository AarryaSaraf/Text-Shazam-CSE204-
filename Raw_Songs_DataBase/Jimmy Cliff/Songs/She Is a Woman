She is a woman, come take my hand
She is a woman, so true and so free
She is a woman, ideal for me
And you know, it's true, true, true
And you know, it's true, true, true

She can take the light out of the day
And paint a dark night bright
She can ease your pain when you feel insane
And make you feel all right
She can shower you with love power, yea, yea
Be a mother like no other
Even when there is no father

She is a woman, woman so strong
She is a woman, come take my hand
She is a woman, so true and so free
She is a woman, ideal for me
And you know, it's true, true, true
And you know, it's true, true, true

It's the man inside me, see the woman in you
It's the woman inside you, see the man in me
Alone we're strong, but together we can't go wrong
So come and take my hand
And if it's cloudy or it's grey, yea, yea
We can make it all OK
And smile the tears away

She is a woman, woman so strong
She is a woman, come take my hand
She is a woman, so true and so free
She is a woman, ideal for me
And you know, it's true, true, true
And you know, it's true, true, true

She's a woman in the morning, in the evening, anytime at all
In the bedroom, in the livingroom, in the kitchen...
