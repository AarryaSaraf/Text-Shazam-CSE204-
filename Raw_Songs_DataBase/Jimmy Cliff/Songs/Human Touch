I like the way I can communicate with you today
I like the way I can keep in touch when you're far away
I think it's cool to stay connected with you on Skype
Or on WhatsApp or some other app when the time is right

Still I love for human touch
I love for human touch
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of the human touch, oh
I love the human touch
I love the human touch
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of the human touch

There's nothing like your smiling face
And your warm embrace
And when I smell your sweet perfume
It's like a flower bloom

Oh, how I miss the way you give your tender kiss
And when you whisper in my ear things I love to hear

Oh, that's the human touch
Yeah, that's the human touch
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of the human touch, mmh
I love your human touch
I love your human touch
I just can't get enough, I need it oh so much
Your human touch

The more I'm connected to my cell phone
The more I'm disconnected from my own
And if I ever I'm in misery
Your human touch in my remedy

Makes me feel alright
Oh, I love to feel alright, oh

Oh, let me touch you, baby
Come on and touch me, baby
I need it oh so much, I need your tender touch
The human touch, ooh
Come on and touch me, baby
Oh, let me touch you, baby
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of your human touch

Oh, let me touch you, baby
Come on and touch me, baby
Oh, let me touch you, baby
