Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sea
Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sky
I'm going up there
I'm going up there
Who's coming with me

You know Faith
Can move mountain
Honey, if you try
I say Faith
Can move mountain
Baby, it's no lie
If i lose one eye
I still got one left to see
If i lose one leg
I still got one left to climb

Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sea
Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sky
I'm going up there
I'm going up there
Who's coming with me

You know life
It's what you make it
And I'm gonna make it good
Things don't always turn up the way they should
But I'm not prepared to take it
No, no, no, no, no
They can move mountain
Honey, if you try
Faith can move mountain
Baby, it's no lie

Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sea
Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sky
I'm going up there
I'm going up there
Who's coming with me

Mama look
Mama look at the mountain
Mama look
Mama look at the mountain
Mama look
Mama look at the mountain
Papa look
Papa look at the mountain
