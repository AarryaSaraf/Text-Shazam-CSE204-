I can still remember
When we were much younger
Skies were blue and fields were green
oh the air's so clean

Animals ran wild and free
birds could sing in harmony
flowers would grow all around
and Mother Earth was sound


In those good good old days
In those good good old days
In those good good old days
That used to be

Where did all the green fields go
And flowers now that just won't grow
Animals are dying out
That lives north and south

They found out how to crack the skies
Casting shadows on our eyes
Telling us just how to live
And when to die 


But those good good old days
yes those good good old days
In those good good old days
That used to be

Wasting oil upon the sea
That used to be so fresh and free
Poisoned gases everywhere
Stifling the air

And many children lose their way
By leaders of confusion
And leave them with the price to pay 
Of hastened evolution 


But those good good old days
In those good good old days
yes those good good old days
That used to be

Talking 'bout those good old days
Talking 'bout those good old good old days
Don't you remember
Try to remember
I'm sure you know
I'm sure you know
