Afrika!

Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika, aah, aah

Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika today

Beyond every boundary, black, yellow, red and white
Each one seeking for the light
You hear it in the rain and you hear it in the wind
And it's no gypsy talk, I say

Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika today

Across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans
Calling for this notion
From J.A. to Dakar, from L.A. to Lagos London, Tokyo to Johannesburg

Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika today

Love of life's the vibration
Oh, what sweet motivation
No freeloaders will be there
And with the best from the East
And the best from the West
You are assured of success

Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika today

And the children will sing and generations will ring
The children will sing and generations will ring out
If you get there before I do
Tell all my friends I'm coming too
So meet me in Afrika
