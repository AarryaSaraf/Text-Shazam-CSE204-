My people are not your people
And your people are not my people
And my people are not your people
Oh no

I loved you because I was lonely
Wondering and also lost
And in order to have a good future
I was searching to find my past
Wherever thou goest I would go
But I found out your greatest seeing is to know

My people are not your people
And your people are not my people
And my people are not your people
Oh no

I knew you when I was a drifter
Suffering with no connection
You knew me more than I knew myself
But you would point me in my direction
I was in the dark, you were in the light
Now I can tell day from night

My people are not your people
And your people are not my people
And my people are not your people
Oh no

And my people are just my people
Oh yea

My people are not your people
And your people are just your people
And my people are just my people

I don't wanna mix with your people
My people ain't your people
