Who am I talking to it's just myself
I talk to the wall, when I talk with someone else
Only a few, that I met really knew
Why so many good things had so much abuse

I can't stop from worrying
About the things we do
I can't stop loving
Without it, nothing would seem true

I've got my dreams about the way it's gonna be
I'd share it all with someone, who is real not make-believe
It sometimes gets hard, to see the wood from the tree
But when things are right, then no questions will I need
That's why I gotta sing, sing

I can't stop from worrying
About the things we do
I can't stop loving
Without it, nothing would seem true



Gonna sing it to you

I can't stop from worrying
About the things we do
I can't stop loving
Without it, nothing would seem true

The scenery's changed, but my feelings remain
Laughter and pain and love is still the same
Something worth having doesn't come too easily
A man needs the challenge or a man couldn't be
That's why I gotta sing to you

I can't stop from worrying
About the things we do
I can't stop loving
Without it, nothing would seem true

I can't stop from worrying
About the things we do
I can't stop loving
Without it, nothing would seem true
