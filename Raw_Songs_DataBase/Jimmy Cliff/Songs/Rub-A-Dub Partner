(You are my rub-a-dub partner, you are my rub-a-dub partner)

I'm gonna take you to a session tonight
We're gonna dance reggae music all night
Then I take you to the beach tomorrow
So you can wash away all your sorrow
'Cause, come now and you're my partner
Whenever there's a session
You'll be my rub-a-dub partner (You are my rub-a-dub partner)
(You are my rub-a-dub partner)

You are my rub-a-dub partner
You and I gonna dub it on the corner
You are my reverb
I and you gonna dub it till the leather
You are my rub-a-dub partner (You are my rub-a-dub partner)
(You are my rub-a-dub partner)

You are my dancing partner
You and I gonna dub it little harder
You are my reverb
You and I gonna dub it till the leather
You are my dancing partner

You are my dancing partner
You and I gonna dub it little harder
You are my dancing partner
You and I gonna dub it little harder, wow, oh, oh

You are my dancing partner
You and I gonna dub it little harder
You are my reverb
You and I gonna dub it till the leather
You are my rub-a-dub partner

(You are my rub-a-dub partner, you are my rub-a-dub partner)
(You are my rub-a-dub partner, you are my rub-a-dub partner)
(You are my rub-a-dub partner, you are my rub-a-dub partner)
Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub-a-dub-a, rub-a-dub-a
(You are my rub-a-dub partner, you are my rub-a-dub partner)
You are my rub-a-dub partner
You and I gonna dub it on the corner
You are my dancing partner
You and I gonna dub it little harder
