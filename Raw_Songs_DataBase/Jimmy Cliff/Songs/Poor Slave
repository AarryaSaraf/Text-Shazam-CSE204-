Poor slave
Take the shackles off your body
Poor slave
Put the shackles on your mind

Please listen to me carefully
And if I'm wrong, then correct me
But if I'm right, mind not the praise
Now let us see if we agree
The definition of a slave
Means once a tree, entirely
So a slave is still a slave
If he can think independently

Poor slave
Take the chains off your body
Poor slave
Put the chains on your mind

A tree is still a tree
Though it shed its leaves when winter falls
But it blooms again in spring
Because it did not lose its roots at all
But a slave
Remains a slave
Without the knowledge of its roots
Until, he thought his past
Not just some, but all the truths

Poor slave
Take the chains off your body
Poor slave
Put the chains on your mind

There was a brother the other day
Telling me he's feeling high
Well I just sadly had to sigh
'Cause drugs and booze are lorey
And if I'm asked how to get high
I'll tell them truths and not a lie
The highest high that man can get
Is with knowledge and understanding

Poor slave
Ease the pressure off your body?
Poor slave
Put the pressure on your mind

Poor slave
Ever take the pressure off your body?
Poor slave
Put the pressure on your mind

Poor slave
Take the shackles off your body
Poor slave
Put the shackles on your mind
