What are you doing with your life?
What are you doing with your life?
What are you doing with your life?

You've got one life to live so live it positively
Make sure all you do is based on reality
Live your life as it was your last
And live your life as it was forever

You've got a place a in the sun
Don't let anyone take your crown
You've got a right to be here
Let nothing stop you, let no one put you down

What are you doing with your life?
What are you doing with your life?
You've got to know what you're doing with your life
You've got to know what you're doing with your life
What are you doing with your life?

Don't be no empty tin can to be kicked around
By anyone in any place or in any town
Your conscience is your guide and there is nothing to hide
Let peace and love abide and they will stand by your side

What are you doing with your life?
What are you doing with your life?
You've got know what you're doing with your life
What are you doing with your life?

You've got a place a in the sun
Don't let anyone take your crown
You've got a right to be here
Let nothing stop you, let no one put you down
