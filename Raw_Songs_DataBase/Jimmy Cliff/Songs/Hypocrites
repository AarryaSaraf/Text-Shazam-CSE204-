(Yeah yeah, yeah - heh)
Hypocrite, you dirty hypocrite
You're gonna pay the price some day
Hypocrites, all of you hypocrites
You're gonna pay the price some day
Words you speak from your mouth
But your heart is telling lies
Oh ho hypo -
Hypocrite, you better watch out

We walked, we talked together, yes we did
We ate, we drank together, yes we did
But when I find
You're a snake in the grass
My heart grieved to be taken for an ass
(Ooh hoo) but

Hypocrite, all of you hypocrites
You're gonna pay the price some day
Hypocrite, stinking hypocrite
Gonna pay the price some day
Words you speak from your mouth
But your heart is telling lies
Oh ho hypo -
Hypocrite, you better watch out

All the time I was joking with you
You were planning to make me blue
On one side of your smile
Was a frown
You said you wish me well
Yet you drag me down
Anywhere you go
There is always one to be found
(Woh ho ho ho)

Hypocrite, stinking hypocrite
You're gonna pay the price someday
Hypocrite, you rotten hypocrite
You're gonna pay the price some day
Words you speak from your mouth
But your heart is telling lies
Oh ho hypo -
Hypocrite, you better watch out

Hypocrites, you dirty hypocrites
I know you're gonna pay the price some day
(Woh oh oh)
Hypocrites, all of you hypocrites
I know you're gonna pay the price some day
(Woh oh oh)
Hypocrites, all of you hypocrites
I know you're gonna pay the price
I said you're gonna pay the price some day
(Yeah heh heh)
Hypocrites, all of you hypocrites
(Woh oh)
You're gonna pay the price
You're gonna pay the price some day
Hypocrites
