The battle has long begun
See them coming one by one
See them coming two by two
But it seems like just a few
'Cause you are the mighty and wise
We're going to cut them right down to size

Fight on, brave warrior
Until they open up the door for you
Fight on, brave warrior
'Cause if they don't, we're going to bust it through

If they come physically
We're going to take them psychologically
If they come psychologically
We're going to take them on mentally
If they come mentally
We're going to take them on spiritually

Fight on, brave warrior
Until they open up the door for you
Fight on, brave warrior
'Cause if they don't, we're going to bust it through

Because your cause is righteous and just
By any means, destruction's a must
Because you are the mighty and wise
We cut them right down to size
Only the strong can survive
There is no question who will stay alive

Fight on, brave warrior
Until they open up the door for you
Fight on, brave warrior
'Cause if they don't, we're going to bust it through
