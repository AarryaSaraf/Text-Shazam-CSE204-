Shelter of your love
The shelter of your love
Shelter of your love
Talking 'bout the shelter of your love

How I survived, I don't know
Still I'm glad to say I'm still here today
I tried to pretend but it was just a show
Now I just can't hide. I had to swallow my pride

And I had to run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love

You know I'm a man, I don't like to brag
But it's been cold and empty out here, it's been a drag
A man don't fight and run away, will live to fight another day
Well, it's these words I sing that keeps me holding on today

I know that I can run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love

The shelter of your love
Longing for the shelter of your love
The shelter of your love
Talking 'bout the shelter of your love
The shelter of your love
The shelter of your love

I know that I can run for the shelter of your love
That's what kept me holding on so strong
Run for the shelter
So strong, so long
Run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love

Shelter of your love
Talking 'bout the shelter of your love
