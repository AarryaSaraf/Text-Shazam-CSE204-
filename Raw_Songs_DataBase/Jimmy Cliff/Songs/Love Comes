Love comes like a miracle...

Love comes to the rescue - whenever you need it
Love comes like a miracle so you better believe
It's true (it's true) - when I look deep inside of you
Just when I think I cannot find
Some peace of mind...

Love comes to the rescue - whenever you need it
Love comes like a miracle so you better believe
It's true (true) - when I'm lost for words to explain
And my heart is filled with the kind of pain
I just don't need
Oh...

Love comes to the rescue (to the rescue) - whenever you need it
Love (don't you know, don't you know that) comes like a miracle (like a miracle)...

Just when I think I can't find some peace of mind...
Love - love comes...
Love comes...
Let it in...
