They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
Took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard

Now while those cats get fat
In came all the rats
Stole away the cheese
And doing as they please
Jack Spratt ate all the fat
His wife ate all the lean
And so between the both, you see
They licked the platter clean, so

They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard
We're singing

Now there's a gathering on Main Street
Shuffling on Wall Street
To a new drum beat
Turning up the heat, now
Now the weak get strong
Singing a new song
Time has come for us to right the wrong

They took the children's bread, hey
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
I say they took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard
We're singing

They took the children's bread, hey
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard, hey
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard, hey
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard
