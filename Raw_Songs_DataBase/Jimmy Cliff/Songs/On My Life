On my life I swear I'll never let you down
On my life comes what may we're heaven bounded
The time has come and we must stand, hand in hand
Sink or swim, we're moving and have faith within
On my life all in one I know we'll win

On my life rest assured I'll never bend
I declared the rights I was to defend
Go on step fast and victory is a surety
Guarantee, security from almighty
On my life I'd pledge with all solemnity

Yeah! Hey, now...

On my life I swear I'll never let you down
On my life comes what may we're heaven bounded
Time has come and we must stand, hand in hand
Sink or swim, we're moving and have faith within
On my life all in one I know we'll win

Oh, my love, on my life
On my life I swear to you
On my life, oh, oh
I swear to you any... day now
On my life I know we'll win
I know I know it can't go wrong, yeah...
