Your love, lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it it up
Quench my desire
And I'll be at your side, forever more


You know your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (keeps on lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (keeps on lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)

Now once, I was down hearted
Disappointment, was my closest friend
But then you, came and it soon departed
And you know he never
Showed his face again


That's why your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (keeps on lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (keeps on lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)

[Organ solo]

I'm so glad, I've finally found you
That someone, in a million girls
And I whip, my loving arms around you
I can stand up, and face the world 


That's why your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keeps on lifting (keeps on lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
Everyday your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (keeps on lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)

Lift me up, woman (your love keeps lifting me)
Keeps on lifting (keeps on lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (keeps on lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
