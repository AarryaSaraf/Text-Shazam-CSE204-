Oh yeah the American dream
American dream
The American dream

So you want to get American visa
Go to where they say the living is easier
Since you were young you been told
You can get anything there
But the soul

Freedom and prosperity for all
Equal opportunity stalk all
But words without deeds
Is like a gold wind full of breeze
So you better take heed

So you better beware
And you better take care
Cause you just might be there for a nightmare

Oh yeah the American dream
The American dream
The American dream
Is not what it seems

And so it's better to seek a home
In Mount Zion I than in Rome
Cause when your lake be get dry
A lot of people go comply
Some might even die

And so is Africa for Africans
India for Indians
China for the Chinese ones
Europe for Europeans

And now you understand
I hope you find your Land
Because a dream is not reality

Oh yeah the American dream
American dream
The American dream
Oh yeah the American dream
The American dream
Is not what it seems

Yeah
For some it means the power and the glory
And still for some a super vision story
Still for some an illusion filled with confusion
And illusion notions

I know for some it means a man's ambition
Or the memory of organisation
For when the big operations
Take you in litigation you need protection
From most High Jah Rastafari

So you better beware
And you better take care
Cause you just might be there for a nightmare

Oh yeah the American dream
The American dream
The American dream
Is not what it seems

Why do you slumber
From January to December
Dream will only last while you sleep
Yeah, don't looking' for it there
