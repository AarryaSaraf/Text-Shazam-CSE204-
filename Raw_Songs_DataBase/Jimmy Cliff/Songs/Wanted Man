I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm on the run...

They say I'm a threat, to their society
'Cause I stand for love and justice, sincerity
The price on my head is getting, higher every day
But I say, oh Lord, thank you, alhamdulillah
They don't know where I stay... and that's why

I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm on the run...

I said that I never, never did no wrong
But they wanna cut me down, 'cause I'm strong, strong, strong
I stand for truths and rights and this they don't like
So they want to cut me down to get me
Clean out of sight... but they can't, so

I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man

I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm on the run...

They say I'm a threat to their society
'Cause I stand for love and justice, sincerity
Truth is my defense and it's no sin
To some it's an offense that's how I win
And that's how: I'm a wanted, wanted man
Yes I'm a wanted, wanted man, but I stand for what I believe
And what I believe in is truths and rights
Truths and rights, truths and rights
