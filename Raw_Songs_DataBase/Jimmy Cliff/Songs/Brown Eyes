Sailing down the coast in my little rowboat
Ain't found her yet got a ways to go
Gotta find that girl and make her mine, yeah man
Oh she's the one with the big brown eyes

In my dream I met this girl
We were in love at Port Royal's Cove
I promised her I'd show her the world
But now I'm awaken and there is no girl

Sailing down the coast in my little rowboat
Ain't found her yet got a ways to go
Gotta find that girl and make her mine, yeah man
Oh she's the one with the big brown eyes

Now I've heard that dreams come to life
And if this is true she'll be my wife
Crazy they call me but soon they'll see
We'll be as one and live in harmony, yeah

I've seen a lot of girls and man they're fine
And they're fine, so fine
Not one of them compare to mine
No not one, no not one
She's got the cutest little smile, yeah man
She's got the cutest little smile
I'm looking for the one with big brown eyes

Sailing down the coast in my little rowboat
Ain't found her yet got a ways to go
Gotta find that girl and make her mine, yeah man
Oh she's the one with the big brown eyes

Sailing down the coast in my little rowboat
In my little rowboat
Ain't found her yet got a ways to go
Ain't found her yet got a ways to go
Gotta find that girl and make her mine, yeah man
Gotta make her mine
Oh she's the one with the big brown eyes

I've seen a lot of girls and man they're fine
And they're fine, so fine
Not one of them compare to mine
No not one of them compare to mine
She's got the cutest little smile, yeah man
She's got the cutest little smile
I'm looking for the one with big brown eyes
