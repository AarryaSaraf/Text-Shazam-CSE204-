It's getting to the point 
Where I can't hang around no more 
It's getting to the point 
Where really have to open up the door 

Times are changing 
You better use your sense 
Use what you've got 
From coincidence 
Hear me now! 

Sooner or later you gonna have to stand up tall 
Sooner or later when your backs against that wall 
Sooner or later you'll have to be the one you are 
And you just might find that you're out of time 
And it's just too late 

Hear me now! 

Heavy burden gets you down 
And pressure is all around 
Sit around and hesitate 
Say you're waiting for a lucky break 

Life's for living 
Better use your sense 
Use what you've got 
From coincidence 
Hear me now! 

Sooner or later you gonna have to stand up tall 
Sooner or later when your backs against that wall 
Sooner or later you'll have to be the one you are 
Or you just might find that you're out of time 
And it's just too late 

Heavy burden gets you down 
And pressure is all around 
You sit around and hesitate 
Say you're waiting for the lucky break 

Life's for living 
Better use your sense 
Use what you've got 
From coincidence 
Hear me now! 

Sooner or later you gonna have to stand up tall 
Sooner or later when your backs against that wall 
Sooner or later you'll have to be the one you are 
Or you just might find that you're out of time 
And it's just too late
