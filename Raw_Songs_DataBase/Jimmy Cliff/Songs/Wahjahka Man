I never needed nobody, to show me how to walk
I never needed nobody, to teach me how to talk
Never needed nobody, to tell me make my mark
I'm experienced man, I can understand
I know how to get along

Wahjahka man, in a any land
In a Jamaica, in a Britannia (I'm a)
Wahjahka man, in a any land
In a Africa, in America (uh huh hey hey)

I never needed nobody, to come and hold me hand
I never needed nobody, to take me through' the land
Never needed nobody, to tell me make a stand
I'm experienced man, I can understand
I know how to get along

I never needed nobody, to show me how to walk
I never needed nobody, to teach me how to talk
Never needed nobody, to tell me make my mark
I'm experienced man, I can understand
I know how to get along
