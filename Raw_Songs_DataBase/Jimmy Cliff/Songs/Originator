Some saying this, some saying that
Some saying things they really don't know, but
Some say I'm mad, that's when I'm glad
Ever so glad because I am no fad
And I cares not what Babylon say
Or who they say they are
They got to come, they got to come my way
Or they won't get far

I'm the originator (originator)
No imitator (originator)
I'm the originator (originator)
I the creator

Some say go right, some say go left
I-man said balance 'cause that's the best
Some talking 'bout a new economic order
A spiritual one I and I would rather
'Cause we're in Rome, but we do not do
What those Romans do
They got to come, they got to come our way
Faith will see us through

I and I originator (originator)
Soul inspirator (originator)

Some say we're dreamers
Some say we're schemers
Some say we're fooled
'Cause we won't be their tools
I and I a winner, we're no beginner
Won't be your sinner 'cause we know Jah rules
And we cares not what Babylon say
Or who they say we are
They got to come, they got to come our way
Or they won't get far
