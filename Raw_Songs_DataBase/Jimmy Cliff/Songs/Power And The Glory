Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
What a great conspiracy
(Conspiracy, conspiracy)

Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
What a great controversy
(Controversy, controversy)

Whoa, what a situation
This our fathers' land
Power and glory is all they're after
Oh, I can see them getting the disaster
This power belongs unto our father
No one nowhere can change this order
See Babylon in confusion
Oh, we're trodding Armageddon

Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
What a great conspiracy
(Conspiracy, conspiracy)

So Red China and so called Arab world
All in the runnings to see who can be king of the world
Innocent bloodshed for crown and title
Won't get no one nowhere in this cycle
So brimstone, fire and hailstone
Are coming down on every side
'Cause the ploughman has overtaken the reaper
And the downpressor has now become a loser

Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
What a great controversy
(Controversy, controversy)

Oh, what a conspiracy
Upon humanity, yeah
U.S.S.R, United States and Soviet Russia
Wants to keep the world under pressure
I say they're one and the same under disguise and a name
Oh no, this can't go on
The nation rise, one nation fall
Leading the righteous standing there

Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
What a great conspiracy
(Conspiracy, conspiracy)

Oh the power and the glory
Oh Jah Jah power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
What a great controversy
(Controversy, controversy)

But I know
And I know, I know
I know Jah
Well, I know, I know, I know
Jah
Earthquake, ligthning and thunder
Brimstone, fire and hailstone
For Jah, hey, hey...
