Roots woman, roots woman 
She's a roots woman 
It's the truth, woman 
And you turn me on 

Roots woman, roots woman 
She's my roots woman 
It's the truth, woman 
And you turn me on 

Now she don't worship diamonds 
She don't worship pearls 
She don't worship silver 
She don't worship gold 

She'll live the life she'll love 
And love the life she'll live 
And give me plenty lovin' 
And it keeps me bubbling on 

Roots woman, roots woman 
She's a roots woman 
It's the truth, woman 
And you turn me on 

Roots woman, roots woman 
She's my roots woman 
It's the truth, woman 
And you turn me on 

Now I don't know what you'd say 
If you saw me yesterday 
But I know what you'd say 
If you see I mon today 

She'll cook that country porridge 
If I get her knowledge 
Keep a lookin' smashin' 
And it keeps us bubbling on 

And I'm talking 'bout the 
Roots woman, roots woman 
She's my roots woman 
It's the truth, woman 
And you turn me on 

Roots woman, roots woman 
She's a roots woman 
It's the truth, woman 
And you turn me on 

Turn me on now 
Oh, yeah 
I'll turn you on 
Mmm, hmm 

Sometimes we have to fuss 
Sometimes we have to fight 
But that don't hinder us 
From making it alright 

You see, love is our foundation 
Ever since creation 
And funny as it seems 

And I'm talking 'bout the 
Roots woman, roots woman 
She's a roots woman 
It's the truth, woman 
And you turn me on 

Roots woman, roots woman 
She's a roots woman 
It's the truth, woman 
And you turn me on 

Turn me on now 

Roots woman, roots woman (Oh, yeah) 
She's my roots woman (I'll turn you on) 
It's the truth, woman (Mmm, hmm) 
She's my roots woman (Yeah) 

Roots woman, roots woman (Oh, yeah) 
She's my roots woman  
(Talking 'bout the roots woman, roots woman) 
It's the truth, woman 
She's my roots woman (Oh, yeah) 

Roots woman, roots woman (Uh-huh) 
She's my roots woman (She's my roots woman) 
It's the truth, woman (It's the truth, woman) 
She's my roots woman (It's the roots woman) 

Roots woman, roots woman (And you turn me on) 
She's my roots woman (Turn me on now)
