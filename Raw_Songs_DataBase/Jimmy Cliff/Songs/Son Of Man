Son of Man has risen
Up from the prison
Broken the spell and anyone can tell

Son of Man is free
Sister you and me
We're common people with integrity

Son of Man
Say rise
Wipe your weeping eyes
You are alive and there's nothing to hide

Son of Man is free
Walk upon the seas
We're common people with integrity

Son of man
Son of man
Son of man
Son of man

'Cause He hath shewed thee, O man
What is good
And what does your lord require of you
But to do justice
And to love mercy
And to walk humble with your king

Son of man
Son of man
Son of man
Son of man

Yes He hath shewed thee, O man
What is good
And what does your lord require of you
But to do justice
And to love mercy
And to walk humble with your king

Son of Man
Say rise
Wipe your weeping eyes
You are alive and there's nothing to hide

Son of Man is free
Walk upon the seas
We're common people with integrity

Son of man
Son of man
Son of man
Son of man
