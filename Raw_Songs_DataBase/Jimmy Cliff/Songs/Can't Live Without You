Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

You've always been beside me
For a moment of my youth
I know deep down inside me
You've always shared the truth

But life is brief and fickle
And all that starts must end
So la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

We've seen a lot together
Sometimes good but mostly bad
Through every change of weather
You're the only one I've had

But life is brief and fickle
And all that starts must end
So la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

The dream that we all live in
The plans we try to make
The treasures we are giving
Are more than we can take

But life is brief and fickle
And all that starts must end
So la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

But life is brief and fickle
And all that starts must end
So la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
