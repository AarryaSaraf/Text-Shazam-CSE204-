Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind
Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind

Jamaica, men have called you since Columbus sailed to the shores
From John Hawkins to Henry Morgan and many more
They all loved you for your party and your wealth
But cared nothing for your welfare or your health
Now you're a woman that has fallen in the dust
But your children will help you because they must

Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind

From the Midlands to Morant Point, from Kingston to Mobay
Discontentment is the order of the day
And like your sisters that are in the Caribbean
Disaffection from deception can be seen
Your many lovers were deceivers from the start
Now your sons and daughters hug you to the heart

Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind
Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind

Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind
They don't know, oh Jamaica,
Oh Jamaica now, oh Jamaica
Hey, hey, eh you're always on my mind

Oh Jamaica, hey hey hey, oh Jamaica, hmmn hmmn

Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica now, oh Jamaica
Eeee eee hey, you're always on my mind
