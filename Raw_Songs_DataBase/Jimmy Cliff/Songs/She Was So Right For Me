She was so right for me
She was so right for me
She was so right for me
And I know, oh I know

Met her in the winter of my life
Thought that I'd make her my wife
But I didn't let the lady know
Just how much I love her so

So many people just don't understand
They want to say our love is so wrong
It's never too late for a shower of rain
I'll go back and start all over again

Because she was so right for me
She was so right for me
She was so right for me
And I know, oh I know

So right when I am with her
There is so much confidence
Ooh, sometimes I miss her
Unforgettable experience

So many people just don't understand
They want to say our love is so wrong
But it's never too late for a shower of rain
Yes I'll go back and start all over again

Because she was so right for me
She was so right for me
She was so right for me
And I know, oh I know

No use to regret now
Divine love you don't forget now
'Cause I know the love we shared
Was beyond the earthly atmosphere

She was a lover, a mother and a friend
Love like this could just never end
Still so many people just don't understand
They want to say our love is so wrong

But I know that she was so right for me
She was so right for me
She was so right for me
I know, oh I know

But I keep on telling you
You darling can't you see?
You was so right for me
You darling can't you see?

You was so right for me
You darling can't you see?
You was so right for me
You darling can't you see?
