// Stand Up and Fight Back //

Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose

Oneness is a reality
Suppressed by evil mentality
Your heart yearns for love
And your mind cries for peace and happiness

Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose

Ever since generations, they been saying it will change
It will change, it will change, it will change, it will change
But it never seems to change
No matter how high the price you pay
They're gonna say you're wrong any way
People like a malignant cancer
Oh how they shun the truth

Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose

No matter what the people say
Never, never, never run away
You're the youth, you're the change, you're the new
You're the one to free yourself

Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose

// She Is a Woman //

She is a woman, come take my hand
She is a woman, so true and so free
She is a woman, ideal for me
And you know, it's true, true, true
And you know, it's true, true, true

She can take the light out of the day
And paint a dark night bright
She can ease your pain when you feel insane
And make you feel all right
She can shower you with love power, yea, yea
Be a mother like no other
Even when there is no father

She is a woman, woman so strong
She is a woman, come take my hand
She is a woman, so true and so free
She is a woman, ideal for me
And you know, it's true, true, true
And you know, it's true, true, true

It's the man inside me, see the woman in you
It's the woman inside you, see the man in me
Alone we're strong, but together we can't go wrong
So come and take my hand
And if it's cloudy or it's grey, yea, yea
We can make it all OK
And smile the tears away

She is a woman, woman so strong
She is a woman, come take my hand
She is a woman, so true and so free
She is a woman, ideal for me
And you know, it's true, true, true
And you know, it's true, true, true

She's a woman in the morning, in the evening, anytime at all
In the bedroom, in the livingroom, in the kitchen...

// You Left Me Standing By The Door //

You left me standing by the door
You left me standing by the door
I know troubles won't last too long
But give me the strength and courage
To carry on
You left me standing by the door
That was yesterday
You left me standing by the door

Farewell, you bid me in the prison
But a light shone through
Showing me a new horizon
Pain is just a stimulant to make you grow
So I made it through and I think you should know

You left me standing by the door
That was yesterday
You left me standing by the door
I know troubles won't last too long
God give me the strength and courage
To carry on
You left me standing by the door
You left me standing by the door

I was unaware of the chains that had me bound
While you were excited 'bout the new life that was found
I prayed for guidance from above
'Cause I've been forgotten and no one to show me love

You left me standing by the door
You left me standing by the door

// Footprints //

We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll turn the pages one more time
We'll trace the footprints once again

There will be no compromise
There'll be no stones left unturned
And let love and honesty abide
We'll trace the footprints once again

When something's lost, then something is gained
If there was no sun, there would be no need for rain
Things will grow old, for the new to begin
There is no mystery, that cannot be explained
And the river flows to the sea
And the world keeps spinning around
Not even the Jordan River can keep us from the shore

We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll dig deep down in the sand
Till we find the rock on which we stand

We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll turn the pages one more time
We'll trace the footprints one more time

We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll turn the pages one more time
We'll trace the footprints one more time

// Meeting In Afrika //

Afrika!

Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika, aah, aah

Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika today

Beyond every boundary, black, yellow, red and white
Each one seeking for the light
You hear it in the rain and you hear it in the wind
And it's no gypsy talk, I say

Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika today

Across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans
Calling for this notion
From J.A. to Dakar, from L.A. to Lagos London, Tokyo to Johannesburg

Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika today

Love of life's the vibration
Oh, what sweet motivation
No freeloaders will be there
And with the best from the East
And the best from the West
You are assured of success

Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika
Oh yea, Afrika, meeting in Afrika today

And the children will sing and generations will ring
The children will sing and generations will ring out
If you get there before I do
Tell all my friends I'm coming too
So meet me in Afrika

// Wanted Man //

I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm on the run...

They say I'm a threat, to their society
'Cause I stand for love and justice, sincerity
The price on my head is getting, higher every day
But I say, oh Lord, thank you, alhamdulillah
They don't know where I stay... and that's why

I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm on the run...

I said that I never, never did no wrong
But they wanna cut me down, 'cause I'm strong, strong, strong
I stand for truths and rights and this they don't like
So they want to cut me down to get me
Clean out of sight... but they can't, so

I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man

I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm on the run...

They say I'm a threat to their society
'Cause I stand for love and justice, sincerity
Truth is my defense and it's no sin
To some it's an offense that's how I win
And that's how: I'm a wanted, wanted man
Yes I'm a wanted, wanted man, but I stand for what I believe
And what I believe in is truths and rights
Truths and rights, truths and rights

// Lonely Streets //

I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
There was no love, no, no love to be found
There was no love, no, no love to be found

Evening comes, sun sinks low
Shadows tell that it's time to go
Mystic smiles on faces wild
Comic styles but their faces don't glow

I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
There was no love, no, no love to be found
There was no love, no, no love to be found

Wandering child, searching for directions
That images don't show
It's a sin, beckoning, for the love that they need to know

I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
There was no love, no, no love to be found
There was no love, no, no love to be found

I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets

// Love I Need //

I say I can't get
You know I can't get
The love I need
The love I need

Maybe I'm just wasting time
Trying to get a fish on a line
Anyway, I'm a man, so I got to try

Maybe I'm just hard to please
But then again, it's just my needs
Maybe it's just the way that I am high

Because I can't get
No, no, I can't get
You know I can't get
The love I need
The love I need

I know that it's love it takes
To keep this man in me awake
And I find it hard to compromise

There's no mountain hard to climb
When I got the love I need full time
To keep me satisfied and it's just my size

Therefore I can't get
You know I can't get
No, no, I, I can't get
The love I need
The love I need

I don't want no part-time love
I don't want no part-time love
Don't want no part-time love
Don't want no part-time love

Because I can't get
I know I can't get
No, no, I, I can't get
The love I need
The love I need

Don't want no part-time love (The love I need)
And I don't want no part-time love (The love I need)
Don't want no part-time love (The love I need)
Don't want no part-time love (The love I need)

Part time love (The love I need)
(The love I need)

// Universal Love (Beyond The Boundaries) //

Yea, beyond the boundaries, the boundaries of your mind
Aah, beyond the boundaries

Beyond your individual boundary
Beyond the family boundaries
Go beyond your tribal boundaries
And beyond the social boundaries
Yes, beyond the national boundaries
Universal love, universal love

Go beyond your religious boundaries
And beyond the political boundaries
Yes, beyond the commercial boundaries
And beyond the sexual boundaries
Yes, beyond the national boundaries
Universal love, universal love

Go beyond your religious boundaries
And beyond the political boundaries
Yes, beyond the commercial boundaries
And beyond the sexual boundaries
Yes, beyond the racial boundaries
Universal love, universal love

We don't need no new religion
We don't need no other Saviour
What we need is to understand
Our fellow man and our behaviour
To live in love and unity
Universally, universal love

Within your family boundaries
And within your tribal boundaries
And within your political boundaries
Yes, within your religious boundaries
Universal love, universal love

Universal love
I hear some people say love is just a four-letter word today
There's a question I like to ask:
Where would you be without love?
Love is why you're here
Love is why you came here
Universal love
