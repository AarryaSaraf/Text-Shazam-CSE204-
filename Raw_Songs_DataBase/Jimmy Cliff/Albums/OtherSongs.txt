// A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall //

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand takers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded and hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

// Give The People What They Want //

Hey, hey, hey!
Give the people what they want

Well, its been said before, the world is a stage
A different performance with every age.
Open the history book to any old page
Bring on the lions and open the cage.

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please

The roman promoters really did things right.
They needed a show that would clearly excite.
The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight
Threw the christians to the lions, sold out every night

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please

Give em lots of sex, perversion and rape
Give em lots of violence, and plenty to hate
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want

When olswald shot kennedy, he was insane
But still we watch the re-runs again and again
We all sit glued while the killer takes aim
Hey mom, there goes a piece of the presidents brain!

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Blow out your brains, and do it right
Make sure its prime time and on a saturday night.
You gotta give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want

// Goodbye Yesterday //

Goodbye yesterday, welcome today

// Hold Tight //

Well it's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth. [2x]

In this struggle for our survival
Your best friend can be your biggest rival.
If we must live by the laws of the jungle
Like dogs and pigs to rumble and tumble now.

And it's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth. [2x]
It's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth.

It's a war for world domination.
You've got to stand and declare your posession.
Cause we're the righteous won't be the agressors,
But we will fight against oppressors now.

Then it's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth.
Because it's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth.
Because a lie is a lie
And the truth is the truth.
So it's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth.

Hold I, hold to your brush.
Hold I, be on your boundry.
Hold I, don't you let go now.
Hold I, yeah yeah.

Eye for an eye,
Tooth for a tooth.

And we know we won't be the losers,
We'll be the victors, or be the martyrs.
Cause we're fighting in the way of the most I,
That's how we know we shall not die now.

Hold I, hold to your brush.
Hold I, be on your boundry.
Hold I, don't you let go.
Hold I...

[Chorus]

We won't be the agressors
Fight downpressors now...
And dis ya jungle laws here
Me say...

Hold I my brush.
Don't you let go man.

// House Of Exile //

There's a day of feasting and a day of famine
Day of sadness and a day of joy
You could see in the day of feasting
Life isn't just a little play-like toy.

So the day arrived when you least expected
Cos you always thought you were well protected
Now you feel like a fish out of water
So now you're wondering what's the matter.

Oh remember you said it wouldn't happen to you
Now you're thinking how to start a new
A drowning man will catch at a straw
You were warned but you wouldn't take heed.

Everything in creation must obey a law.
Its true in words as it is in deed.
You were so puffed up in your pomps and pride
You're exposed you got none to hide

Yes, you used to look down on the folks beside you
Never they think you would have come down too

Remember they said you got to reap what you sow
Simple truth everybody know

Oh what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile
Yes, what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile

[Music interlude]

Oh what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile
O OH what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile

Everything in creation must obey a law.
Its true in words as it is in deed

// Human Touch //

I like the way I can communicate with you today
I like the way I can keep in touch when you're far away
I think it's cool to stay connected with you on Skype
Or on WhatsApp or some other app when the time is right

Still I love for human touch
I love for human touch
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of the human touch, oh
I love the human touch
I love the human touch
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of the human touch

There's nothing like your smiling face
And your warm embrace
And when I smell your sweet perfume
It's like a flower bloom

Oh, how I miss the way you give your tender kiss
And when you whisper in my ear things I love to hear

Oh, that's the human touch
Yeah, that's the human touch
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of the human touch, mmh
I love your human touch
I love your human touch
I just can't get enough, I need it oh so much
Your human touch

The more I'm connected to my cell phone
The more I'm disconnected from my own
And if I ever I'm in misery
Your human touch in my remedy

Makes me feel alright
Oh, I love to feel alright, oh

Oh, let me touch you, baby
Come on and touch me, baby
I need it oh so much, I need your tender touch
The human touch, ooh
Come on and touch me, baby
Oh, let me touch you, baby
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of your human touch

Oh, let me touch you, baby
Come on and touch me, baby
Oh, let me touch you, baby

// I Am The Living //

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm a giver, I'm a taker
I'm a liver and a miracle maker

At last, it has come to pass
I know if you just let it go
You will see that everything has its own place and its time
You are free to savor the rhythms and make your own minds

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the meek, I'm the strong
I'm the right and the wrong

At last, it has come to pass
I know you'll flow when you just let it go
You will see that everything has its own place and its time
You are free to savor the rhythms and make your own minds

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm a stranger, I'm a friend
The beginning and the ending

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the thirst and the hunger
I'm the oldest, getting younger

At last, it has come to pass
Living in the nature, it is greater yeah

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the pain and the passion
I'm the essence, satisfaction

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder

// I'm Free //

And I love the life that I live

And you ain't gonna stop me

Whoa, I'm free, nobody now owns me

// Let It Go //

Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow
Got nothing to lose
When we're dancing to the music

It's a vibration 
A sensation
A natural mystic 

Let it go

When the music flow
Got nothing to lose
When we're dancing to the music

Let it go, you've got to let it go

Of everything we think we know
Sometimes we just got to be free
No one telling us how we should be

Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow

When I'm dancing to the music

Just call me music
And don't call me nothing else
All your might
Say we dancing through the night
With all your might
Say we grooving through the night

Sometimes you just got to let go
Of everything you think we know
Sometimes we just got to be free

// My People //

My people are not your people
And your people are not my people
And my people are not your people
Oh no

I loved you because I was lonely
Wondering and also lost
And in order to have a good future
I was searching to find my past
Wherever thou goest I would go
But I found out your greatest seeing is to know

My people are not your people
And your people are not my people
And my people are not your people
Oh no

I knew you when I was a drifter
Suffering with no connection
You knew me more than I knew myself
But you would point me in my direction
I was in the dark, you were in the light
Now I can tell day from night

My people are not your people
And your people are not my people
And my people are not your people
Oh no

And my people are just my people
Oh yea

My people are not your people
And your people are just your people
And my people are just my people

I don't wanna mix with your people
My people ain't your people

// No Justice //

I work all day to find my daily bread
Work so hard to get a roof over my head
But the one's I work with acts like their my masters
When what I refuse I'm more then equal partner

I can't get no justice
Under this system
I can't get no justice in this society
I work day and night to find my daily needs
But freedom is suppressed by another one's greed
Why should serve the one's who control another one's needs?
It's rebellion these kind of actions breeds

I can't get no justice
Under this system
I can't get no justice
In this society

I can't get no justice
Under this system
I can't get no justice
In this society

Why should one be judged by the color of their skin?
Instead of look what it is they show from deep within
If they keep wanting to control what we earn
Run a press around because we're going to burn (going to burn)

I can't get no justice under this system
I can't get me no justice
In this society
I can't get me no justice
Under this system
I can't no justice in this society

I can't get me no justice
Under this system
I can't get no justice
In this society
Yeah, yeah

I can't get no justice under this system
I can't get no justice in this society
I can't get me no justice
Under this system
I can't get no justice in this society

Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind
Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind

Jamaica, men have called you since Columbus sailed to the shores
From John Hawkins to Henry Morgan and many more
They all loved you for your party and your wealth
But cared nothing for your welfare or your health
Now you're a woman that has fallen in the dust
But your children will help you because they must

Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind

From the Midlands to Morant Point, from Kingston to Mobay
Discontentment is the order of the day
And like your sisters that are in the Caribbean
Disaffection from deception can be seen
Your many lovers were deceivers from the start
Now your sons and daughters hug you to the heart

Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind
Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind

Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica
You're always on my mind
They don't know, oh Jamaica,
Oh Jamaica now, oh Jamaica
Hey, hey, eh you're always on my mind

Oh Jamaica, hey hey hey, oh Jamaica, hmmn hmmn

Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh Jamaica, oh Jamaica now, oh Jamaica
Eeee eee hey, you're always on my mind

// On My Life //

On my life I swear I'll never let you down
On my life comes what may we're heaven bounded
The time has come and we must stand, hand in hand
Sink or swim, we're moving and have faith within
On my life all in one I know we'll win

On my life rest assured I'll never bend
I declared the rights I was to defend
Go on step fast and victory is a surety
Guarantee, security from almighty
On my life I'd pledge with all solemnity

Yeah! Hey, now...

On my life I swear I'll never let you down
On my life comes what may we're heaven bounded
Time has come and we must stand, hand in hand
Sink or swim, we're moving and have faith within
On my life all in one I know we'll win

Oh, my love, on my life
On my life I swear to you
On my life, oh, oh
I swear to you any... day now
On my life I know we'll win
I know I know it can't go wrong, yeah...

// Poor Slave //

Poor slave
Take the shackles off your body
Poor slave
Put the shackles on your mind

Please listen to me carefully
And if I'm wrong, then correct me
But if I'm right, mind not the praise
Now let us see if we agree
The definition of a slave
Means once a tree, entirely
So a slave is still a slave
If he can think independently

Poor slave
Take the chains off your body
Poor slave
Put the chains on your mind

A tree is still a tree
Though it shed its leaves when winter falls
But it blooms again in spring
Because it did not lose its roots at all
But a slave
Remains a slave
Without the knowledge of its roots
Until, he thought his past
Not just some, but all the truths

Poor slave
Take the chains off your body
Poor slave
Put the chains on your mind

There was a brother the other day
Telling me he's feeling high
Well I just sadly had to sigh
'Cause drugs and booze are lorey
And if I'm asked how to get high
I'll tell them truths and not a lie
The highest high that man can get
Is with knowledge and understanding

Poor slave
Ease the pressure off your body?
Poor slave
Put the pressure on your mind

Poor slave
Ever take the pressure off your body?
Poor slave
Put the pressure on your mind

Poor slave
Take the shackles off your body
Poor slave
Put the shackles on your mind

// Refugees (Dance Version) //

Refugees
Refugees
We got a big box at home
Ref, ref, ref, ref...

I'm a refugee

There was na exodus from Europe to America
Now there's an exodus from the Middle East to Europe
Yes, there's an exodus from Africa to Europe
People running here and there, looking for a home

Refugees
Refugees
Refugees

Well, couldn't they be someone like you and me?
You know I'm a global citizen in this forum

Listen, I'm a full G that's a refugee
My family paddled through the seas
Made it through day but the night is calling
Load on they back like when camels walking
We gon' make it through the odds
Every day that we live is blessing in disguise
Do unto others as you would have done it to you
Listen, that's just the word from the wise
We live for the fate but we die [?]
'Cause the proof only show that you care about you
About us, if you really do give us this time
We got women and children at the border line

I'm a refugee
Refugees

// She Was So Right For Me //

She was so right for me
She was so right for me
She was so right for me
And I know, oh I know

Met her in the winter of my life
Thought that I'd make her my wife
But I didn't let the lady know
Just how much I love her so

So many people just don't understand
They want to say our love is so wrong
It's never too late for a shower of rain
I'll go back and start all over again

Because she was so right for me
She was so right for me
She was so right for me
And I know, oh I know

So right when I am with her
There is so much confidence
Ooh, sometimes I miss her
Unforgettable experience

So many people just don't understand
They want to say our love is so wrong
But it's never too late for a shower of rain
Yes I'll go back and start all over again

Because she was so right for me
She was so right for me
She was so right for me
And I know, oh I know

No use to regret now
Divine love you don't forget now
'Cause I know the love we shared
Was beyond the earthly atmosphere

She was a lover, a mother and a friend
Love like this could just never end
Still so many people just don't understand
They want to say our love is so wrong

But I know that she was so right for me
She was so right for me
She was so right for me
I know, oh I know

But I keep on telling you
You darling can't you see?
You was so right for me
You darling can't you see?

You was so right for me
You darling can't you see?
You was so right for me
You darling can't you see?

// Shelter of Your Love //

Shelter of your love
The shelter of your love
Shelter of your love
Talking 'bout the shelter of your love

How I survived, I don't know
Still I'm glad to say I'm still here today
I tried to pretend but it was just a show
Now I just can't hide. I had to swallow my pride

And I had to run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love

You know I'm a man, I don't like to brag
But it's been cold and empty out here, it's been a drag
A man don't fight and run away, will live to fight another day
Well, it's these words I sing that keeps me holding on today

I know that I can run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love

The shelter of your love
Longing for the shelter of your love
The shelter of your love
Talking 'bout the shelter of your love
The shelter of your love
The shelter of your love

I know that I can run for the shelter of your love
That's what kept me holding on so strong
Run for the shelter
So strong, so long
Run for the shelter of your love
Run for the shelter of your love

Shelter of your love
Talking 'bout the shelter of your love

// Son Of Man //

Son of Man has risen
Up from the prison
Broken the spell and anyone can tell

Son of Man is free
Sister you and me
We're common people with integrity

Son of Man
Say rise
Wipe your weeping eyes
You are alive and there's nothing to hide

Son of Man is free
Walk upon the seas
We're common people with integrity

Son of man
Son of man
Son of man
Son of man

'Cause He hath shewed thee, O man
What is good
And what does your lord require of you
But to do justice
And to love mercy
And to walk humble with your king

Son of man
Son of man
Son of man
Son of man

Yes He hath shewed thee, O man
What is good
And what does your lord require of you
But to do justice
And to love mercy
And to walk humble with your king

Son of Man
Say rise
Wipe your weeping eyes
You are alive and there's nothing to hide

Son of Man is free
Walk upon the seas
We're common people with integrity

// Too Many Rivers To Cross //

Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of dover

Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left me and she didn't say why
Well, I guess I'll have to cry

Many rivers to cross

But just where to begin I'm playing for time
There have been times I find myself
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime

Yes, I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering, I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover

Yes, I've got many rivers to cross
And I merely survive because of my will...

// Under The Sun, Moon And Stars //

Yes! As I was sayin', I like work, you know.
But when I work I must get paid.
You don't know the sound I'm tryin' to tell you.
Listen! Try to understand! Listen!

My foreparents worked, from sun-up, 'til sun-down.
Peace could not be found now they're under the ground.
I've heard dem complain and cried out in pain.
Seeking peaceful gain under the Sun, Moon and stars.

Won't happen to me. I'm not blind, you see.
I've got to be free. I want it right here on Earth.
Got to have some fun, 'for my life is done.
Let happiness run under the Sun, Moon and stars.

Under the Sun, under the Moon, under the stars, wherever you are!
Got to have some fun under the Sun, Moon and stars.
Got to get some fun under the Sun, Moon and stars.

Don't wanted on Venus, Saturn nor Uranus.
Don't want it on Pluto, I want it right here on Earth.
Don't want it on Jupiter, Neptune nor on Mercury.
Don't want it on Mars, but under the Sun, Moon and stars.

Under the Sun, under the Moon, under the stars, wherever you are!
Got to have some fun under the Sun, Moon and stars.
Let happiness run under the Sun, Moon and stars.

So you didn't understand what I was tryin to tell you...
Got tell you one more time. Listen!

Under the Sun, under the Moon, under the stars, wherever you are!
Got to have some fun under the Sun, Moon and stars.
Let happiness run under the Sun, Moon and stars.

Got to find some peace under the Sun, Moon and stars.
Each and everyone. Under the Sun, Moon and stars.

I still believe in a little bit of magic
Even though the world has gone crazy
So good to know we still have a friend
You came to me last night
And whispered in my ear
Told me not to worry

And the feeling is natural
Right here
