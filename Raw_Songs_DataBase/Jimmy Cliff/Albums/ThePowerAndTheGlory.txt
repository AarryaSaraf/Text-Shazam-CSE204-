// We All Are One //

Mmm...mmm...mmm....
Yeah
Mmm...hmm...mmm....oh...

We all are one, we are the same person
I'll be you, you'll be me (Oh, yeah)
We all are one, same universal world
I'll be you, you'll be me

No matter where we are born,
We are human beings
The same chemistry
Where emotions and feelings
All corresponding in love
Compatible

You can't get around it,
No matter how hard you try
You better believe it
And if you should find out
That you are no different than I
Reply

We all are one (We all),
We are the same person (Same person)
I'll be you, you'll be me (I'll be me, you'll be you)
We all are one (We all), same universal world
I'll be you, you'll be me

The only difference I can see
Is in the conscience
And the shade of our skin
Doesn't matter, we laugh, we chatter
We smile, we all live for

And the feelings that make
All those faces always renew
So true, so true
And would you believe that I have
All those same feelings too
The same as you

We all are one, we are the same person
I'll be you, you'll be me (I'll be me, you'll be you)
We all are one (We all), same universal world
I'll be you, you'll be me (Mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm)

We all are one (We all),
We are the same person (Same person)
I'll be you, you'll be me (I'll be me, you'll be you)
We all are one (We all), same universal world
I'll be you, you'll be me

Look at the children, they're having fun
With no regards to why
They all look different but deep inside
Their feelings of love they don't hide, they don't hide
They don't hide, they don't hide

We all are one, we are the same person
I'll be you, you'll be me (Oh, yeah)
We all are one, same universal world
I'll be you, you'll be me

We all are one (We all),
We are the same person (The same person)
I'll be you, you'll be me (No matter where you go)
We all are one (We all),
Same universal (Same person)
I'll be you, you'll be me (Oh, yeah)

We all are one (You know, I know, we all know),
We are the same person (Oh, yeah)
I'll be you, you'll be me (Oh, yeah)
We all are one (Emotions and feelings),
Same universal (All corresponding to love)
I'll be you, you'll be me (Oh...oh...oh...)

We all are one, we are the same person

// Piece Of The Pie //

The lion is weak and ready for his jungle
What is the jungle
Equal rights and justice
And if he doesn't get it
He's gon' to take it any way and anyhow
So you better give up

We want our piece of the pie
Right here, right now
We want our piece of the pie
Right here, right now

We want our piece of the pie
Right here, right now
We want our piece of the pie

They run our fathers up their pole
And try to take their soul
We realize we know the score
So don't try that no more

No tricks, no traps, no lies, no gripes
Can't hold us anymore
We've had enough of jive and bluff
We want our share for sure

We want our piece of the pie
Right here, right now
We want our piece of the pie
Right here, right now

We want our piece of the pie
Right here, right now
We want our piece of the pie

A hungry man is a angry man
I hope you understand
Because a hand to mouth won't work it out
Of this there is no doubt

We want our share, we have no fear
So you better beware

Worse without a job, hey

We want our piece of the pie

There's one thing we'd like to know
Where does the money go

Well, someone ought to know

This life as living to offer
To every single one
Birds and bees, no woods and trees
There is no existence, hey

We want our piece of the pie, hey
Right now, right here

// American Dream //

Oh yeah the American dream
American dream
The American dream

So you want to get American visa
Go to where they say the living is easier
Since you were young you been told
You can get anything there
But the soul

Freedom and prosperity for all
Equal opportunity stalk all
But words without deeds
Is like a gold wind full of breeze
So you better take heed

So you better beware
And you better take care
Cause you just might be there for a nightmare

Oh yeah the American dream
The American dream
The American dream
Is not what it seems

And so it's better to seek a home
In Mount Zion I than in Rome
Cause when your lake be get dry
A lot of people go comply
Some might even die

And so is Africa for Africans
India for Indians
China for the Chinese ones
Europe for Europeans

And now you understand
I hope you find your Land
Because a dream is not reality

Oh yeah the American dream
American dream
The American dream
Oh yeah the American dream
The American dream
Is not what it seems

Yeah
For some it means the power and the glory
And still for some a super vision story
Still for some an illusion filled with confusion
And illusion notions

I know for some it means a man's ambition
Or the memory of organisation
For when the big operations
Take you in litigation you need protection
From most High Jah Rastafari

So you better beware
And you better take care
Cause you just might be there for a nightmare

Oh yeah the American dream
The American dream
The American dream
Is not what it seems

Why do you slumber
From January to December
Dream will only last while you sleep
Yeah, don't looking' for it there

Whoa, what a situation
This our fathers' land
Power and glory is all they're after
Oh, I can see them getting the disaster
This power belongs unto our father
No one nowhere can change this order
See Babylon in confusion
Oh, we're trodding Armageddon

Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
What a great conspiracy
(Conspiracy, conspiracy)

So Red China and so called Arab world
All in the runnings to see who can be king of the world
Innocent bloodshed for crown and title
Won't get no one nowhere in this cycle
So brimstone, fire and hailstone
Are coming down on every side
'Cause the ploughman has overtaken the reaper
And the downpressor has now become a loser

Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
What a great controversy
(Controversy, controversy)

Oh, what a conspiracy
Upon humanity, yeah
U.S.S.R, United States and Soviet Russia
Wants to keep the world under pressure
I say they're one and the same under disguise and a name
Oh no, this can't go on
The nation rise, one nation fall
Leading the righteous standing there

Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
What a great conspiracy
(Conspiracy, conspiracy)

Oh the power and the glory
Oh Jah Jah power and the glory
Oh the power and the glory
What a great controversy

And I know, I know
I know Jah
Well, I know, I know, I know
Jah
Earthquake, ligthning and thunder
Brimstone, fire and hailstone
For Jah, hey, hey...

// Journey //

Well the years have come and the years have gone
Still the son of man keeps a trotting on
Journey, Journey on
Yet from innocence to experience
from dependence to independence
Journey, Journey on
Well now I have love and I have been loved
I have judged and I have been judged
Journey, Journey on
So where there come a storm there's a victory
Cause I live all and all lives in me
Journey, Journey on

[Chorus:]
Journey, Oh Journey 
and I never get, never get weary yet
Journey, Oh Journey
still I never get, never get weary yet

I was captured on the banks of the river Nile
carried far beyond the seven seas
Journey, Journey on
So I left my home in the morning
I wanna go home in the evening
Journey, Journey on

[Chorus]

Like the sun and sea life is flowing free
I've got to be free 1983
Journey, Journey on
So from the lessons learned and the tables turned
the victories earned and my heart still yearns
Journey, Journey on

[Chorus]
