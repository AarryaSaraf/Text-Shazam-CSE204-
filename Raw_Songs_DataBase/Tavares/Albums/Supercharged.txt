Album: Supercharged

// Bad Times //

One step behind don't make you what you're worth
Blue collar pride, breathing that salty earth
Pay every price, can't keep that dollar bill
It ain't much desire when you're done, lost your will

Talkin' 'bout bad times
Here in these sad times

Too old to try, ain't young enough to split
Cop what you can, get yourself over it
That border line don't really bother me
It ain't what you are, it's what you got to be

Talkin' 'bout bad times
Here in these sad times
That six and one, better than nothing at all
Not for the break that don't ever come

Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Can you dig it?
Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Gonna get you old

Talkin' 'bout bad timin', bad timin'
Bad times, and bad times
Gonna get you old

Don't pray enough to spend the night and wait
Standing too long before it's gets far too late
That ain't your pride, don't burn no candlelight
Ain't not a trip, you got to get old to die

Talkin' 'bout bad times
Here in these sad times
That six and one, better than nothing at all
Not for the break that don't ever come

Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Can you dig it?
Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Gonna get you old

Talkin' 'bout bad timin', bad timin'
Bad times and bad times
Gonna get you old

Talkin' 'bout bad times
Here in these sad times
That six and one, better than nothing at all
Not for the break that don't ever come

Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Can you dig it?
Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Gonna get you old

Talkin' 'bout bad timin', bad timin'
Bad times and bad times
Gonna get you old

I'm talkin' to you, you're talkin' to me
In these sad, sad times

Bad times, bad times
Can you dig, dig, dig, dig, d, dig it
Bad times, bad times
Can you dig, dig, dig, dig it

Bad times, bad times
Can you dig, dig, dig, dig, d, dig it
Bad times, bad times
Can you dig it?

Let's talk about good times, good times
Can you dig it?
Let's talk about good times, good times
Can you dig it?

Let's talk about good times, good times
Can you dig it?
Let's talk about good times, good times
Can you?

// We Both Tried //

What can you do
When love decides to pass you by?
The more we try
The less we get along

There comes a time
In every life
When right or wrong
Is what comes between us
We've seen us fall apart
Down to the seams
Dreams

We both tried
Then love died
Old standbys
Were nice tries
So goodbye
Goodbye

Our love reminded me
Of wishing on a star
It was hard to feel anything
(We're both in love)
We put us through the paces
With total disregard
For the love between us
Refused to grow
Refused to spread her wings
Dreams, whoa

We both tried
We tried, we tried, we tried
Then love died
Ooh, no matter how we tried
Old standbys
Were nice tries
So goodbye
Goodbye, yeah yeah

We both lied
To ourselves about each other
We both cried
'Cause we needed something better
Old standbys (Old standbys)
Were nice tries
So goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Oh, goodbye

Ooh, we both tried
Everything, everything within our power
Then love died
Ooh, by the minute, by the hour
Old standbys (Old standbys)
Were nice tries (They were such nice tries)
So goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye, baby (Goodbye, goodbye)

Oh, we both tried, we both tried, baby
We both lied
And we cried, we cried, we cried, we cried
Old standbys (They were nothin' but standbys)
Were nice tries (Ooh, they tried)
But goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye, baby (Goodbye)
Goodbye (Goodbye, goodbye)
Baby

We tried
Then love died
Ooh, we tried so hard, no matter how we tried
Old standbys (Old standbys)
Were nice tries

// Can't Get Enough //

Yeah, I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough
Yeah

Ain't no quitting time
Ain't no limit sign
On this love for you
You could write a book
'Cause you got me hooked
On the things you do

Maybe I should hold back some
And make you the one to cry
I should use some self-control
But this well just won't run dry

I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah

Pride should stop me cold
I've been told
How you play with me
Cat and mouse, I'm caught
'Cause I'm not
Where I ought to be

I should have the strength to go
Heaven knows I've tried
Your love's an addictive taste
One hit won't make me high

I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough (Yeah)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah

I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Well, well, well
I can't get enough
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I just can't get enough

'Cause in the lonely hour
In the power
Of such loneliness
As the minutes fly
My resistance dives
Down to nothingness

I should turn and go to sleep
Just let the night drift by
But I recall a love so sweet
It's no wonder why

I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough (Yeah)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, ooh

Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough, yeah)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah

In the lonely hour (Yeah)
I can't get enough, yeah (Yeah)
I can't get no sleep (Yeah)
I can't get enough (Can't get enough, yeah)
(Yeah)

Heaven knows I've tried (Yeah)
I can't get enough, yeah (Yeah)
I can't get enough, yeah (Yeah)
I can't get enough

// Why Can't We Fall In Love //

Here we are together, you and I
Feeling like I always knew we could
Seems as though my heart just touched the sky
Never knew that we could feel this good

The joy of you and me
I'm hoping that you'll see
Just reach out to me

Why can't we fall in love? (Why can't we fall in love?)
Why don't we fall in love? (Why don't we fall in love?)
In a world that's rushing by
And when love is seldom true
I know that I can find some strength inside of you
(Strength inside of you)
Can't you feel it too? (Can't you feel it too?)
Don't be afraid to let your love come through

Few of us will ever see the moon
Or even stop to hear our own love songs
Before you know it's over all too soon
I hope that's not the way we move along

Playing foolish games
When no one wins the prize
It's right here in our eyes

Why can't we fall in love? Yeah (Why can't we fall in love?)
Why don't we fall in love? (Why don't we fall in love?)
In a world that's rushing by
And when love is seldom true
I know that I can find some strength inside of you
(Strength inside of you)
Can't you feel it too? (Can't you feel it too?)
Don't be afraid to let your love come through
Hey baby

Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)
Girl, I need you so (Why don't we fall in love?)
In a world that's rushing by
And when love is seldom true
I know that I can find some strength inside you
(Strength inside of you)

Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)
Why, why can't we fall in love? (Why don't we fall in love?)
Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)
Why can't we fall? (Why don't we fall in love?)
Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)

Why don't we fall in love?
Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)
Why don't we fall in love?
Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)

// I Just Can't Go On Living Without You //

Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Ooh

We've been living here together
For so long right from the start
But people been talking about us
They're trying to tear us apart

But I ain't gonna let them get next to me
No matter what they say
'Cause I've been loving you so long
And I ain't gonna let them take you away

Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Ooh

Some say they saw me runnin' 'round
With someone that wasn't you
The same ones pulled me to the side
To tell me that you said we are through

But I ain't gonna let them get next to me
No matter what they say
'Cause I've been loving you so long
And I ain't gonna let them take you away

Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Ooh

Why they tellin' me those lies
They don't seem to realize that I (that I)
Love you (I love you)
And you, you love me, too

Your friend next door has been trying
To make love to me when you're not around
Now I see her in your face just smiling
Tryin' to tell you I've been chasing her down
What a shame

But I ain't gonna let them get next to me
No matter what they say
'Cause I've been loving you so long
And I ain't gonna let them take you away

Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby

// I Don't Want You Anymore //

I don't want you anymore
I'm afraid you're gonna
Treat me like before
I don't want you anymore
'Cause you're always walkin'
In and out the door
I don't want you anymore
With all the games you play
You never let me score
I don't want you anymore
'Cause you never say
Just what you're livin' for

You hurt me
Desert me
And loneliness is all I have
To keep me company
You hurt me
Desert me
If freedom comes from happiness
It's time to say goodbye

I don't want you anymore
'Cause you never tell me why
I still don't know
I don't want you anymore
Baby, when the well runs dry
There ain't no place to go
I don't want you anymore
Baby, I'm wonderin' what
This whole thing's been for
I don't want you anymore
Mama, it's high time I was
Walkin' out the door

You hurt me
Desert me
And loneliness is all I have
To keep me company
You hurt me
Desert me
If freedom comes from happiness
It's time to say goodbye

I don't want you anymore
I'm afraid you're gonna
Treat me like before
I don't want you anymore

I don't want you anymore
I don't want you anymore
Mama, it's high time
You were walking out the door

// Paradise //

Took a look at you
That's all I had to do
And you just took my breath away
I knew I'd never be the same

And when you touched my hand
I went to wonderland
I never dreamed that there could be
The kind of love you made with me last night

Didn't we go to paradise last night?
Hard to believe I see the morning light
Didn't we go to paradise
Last night?

Take a look at me
Tell me what you see (Tell me what you see)
Are there any clouds around?
Or are my feet still on the ground?

Girl, I love you so
I swear I just don't know
How I still could be alive
I can't believe I could survive last night

Didn't we go to paradise last night?
Hard to believe I see the morning light, yeah
Didn't we go to paradise?
Didn't we go to paradise?
Didn't I get to Heaven loving you?
Didn't we find a Shangri-La for two? Yeah
Didn't we go to paradise
Last night?

Yeah, didn't we go to paradise last night?
Hard to believe I see the morning light
Didn't we go to paradise?
Didn't we go to paradise?
Didn't I get to Heaven loving you?
Didn't we find a Shangri-La for two? Yeah
Didn't we go to paradise?

Didn't we go to paradise last night?
Hard to believe I see the morning light
Didn't I get to Heaven loving you?
Didn't we find a Shangri-La for two?

Didn't we go to paradise last night?
Hard to believe I see the morning light
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Didn't I get to Heaven loving you?
Didn't we find a Shangri-La for two?

// Got To Have Your Love //

Looking 'round every corner
Calling out her name
She was gone when I rose this morning
And with her she took my dream

Said she wanted to be a dancer
A soldier of fortune took her away, yeah
No, I can't live without her
I can't face another day

Got to have your love
Darlin', can't you see?
Got to have your love
Don't take my sanity
Got to have your love
Darlin', can't you see
That I need you, I love you
Every day of my life?

Looking 'round every corner
Calling out her name
She will always be the sunshine of my life
And I'm never gonna be the same

And if you have a change of vision
The colors of the rainbow disappear, yeah
Said I'll be here with open arms (Open arms)
You, my dream, will reappear

Got to have your love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Got to have your love
Don't take my sanity
Got to have your love
Oh darlin', can't you see
That I need you, I love you
Every day of my life?

Got to have your love
Darlin', can't you see?
Got to have your love
No, don't take my sanity
Got to have your love
Oh girl, can't you see
That I need you, I love you
Every day of my life?
Need you, I love you
Every day, yeah

Got to have your love
Yeah, yeah, darlin', can't you see?
Got to have your love
No, don't take my sanity
Got to have your love
I need you here beside me
Got to have your love
Don't run away from me

Got to have your love
I need you every day
Got to have your love
Darlin', each and every way
Got to have your love
I got to have, I got to have
I got to have, I got to have your love
Got to have your love
Yeah yeah yeah
