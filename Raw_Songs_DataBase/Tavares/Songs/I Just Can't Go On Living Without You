Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Ooh

We've been living here together
For so long right from the start
But people been talking about us
They're trying to tear us apart

But I ain't gonna let them get next to me
No matter what they say
'Cause I've been loving you so long
And I ain't gonna let them take you away

Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Ooh

Some say they saw me runnin' 'round
With someone that wasn't you
The same ones pulled me to the side
To tell me that you said we are through

But I ain't gonna let them get next to me
No matter what they say
'Cause I've been loving you so long
And I ain't gonna let them take you away

Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Ooh

Why they tellin' me those lies
They don't seem to realize that I (that I)
Love you (I love you)
And you, you love me, too

Your friend next door has been trying
To make love to me when you're not around
Now I see her in your face just smiling
Tryin' to tell you I've been chasing her down
What a shame

But I ain't gonna let them get next to me
No matter what they say
'Cause I've been loving you so long
And I ain't gonna let them take you away

Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
Oh, I just can't go on living without you
Baby
