Looking 'round every corner
Calling out her name
She was gone when I rose this morning
And with her she took my dream

Said she wanted to be a dancer
A soldier of fortune took her away, yeah
No, I can't live without her
I can't face another day

Got to have your love
Darlin', can't you see?
Got to have your love
Don't take my sanity
Got to have your love
Darlin', can't you see
That I need you, I love you
Every day of my life?

Looking 'round every corner
Calling out her name
She will always be the sunshine of my life
And I'm never gonna be the same

And if you have a change of vision
The colors of the rainbow disappear, yeah
Said I'll be here with open arms (Open arms)
You, my dream, will reappear

Got to have your love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Got to have your love
Don't take my sanity
Got to have your love
Oh darlin', can't you see
That I need you, I love you
Every day of my life?

Got to have your love
Darlin', can't you see?
Got to have your love
No, don't take my sanity
Got to have your love
Oh girl, can't you see
That I need you, I love you
Every day of my life?
Need you, I love you
Every day, yeah

Got to have your love
Yeah, yeah, darlin', can't you see?
Got to have your love
No, don't take my sanity
Got to have your love
I need you here beside me
Got to have your love
Don't run away from me

Got to have your love
I need you every day
Got to have your love
Darlin', each and every way
Got to have your love
I got to have, I got to have
I got to have, I got to have your love
Got to have your love
Yeah yeah yeah
