I don't want you anymore
I'm afraid you're gonna
Treat me like before
I don't want you anymore
'Cause you're always walkin'
In and out the door
I don't want you anymore
With all the games you play
You never let me score
I don't want you anymore
'Cause you never say
Just what you're livin' for

You hurt me
Desert me
And loneliness is all I have
To keep me company
You hurt me
Desert me
If freedom comes from happiness
It's time to say goodbye

I don't want you anymore
'Cause you never tell me why
I still don't know
I don't want you anymore
Baby, when the well runs dry
There ain't no place to go
I don't want you anymore
Baby, I'm wonderin' what
This whole thing's been for
I don't want you anymore
Mama, it's high time I was
Walkin' out the door

You hurt me
Desert me
And loneliness is all I have
To keep me company
You hurt me
Desert me
If freedom comes from happiness
It's time to say goodbye

I don't want you anymore
I'm afraid you're gonna
Treat me like before
I don't want you anymore

I don't want you anymore
I don't want you anymore
Mama, it's high time
You were walking out the door
