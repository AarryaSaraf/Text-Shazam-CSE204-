Some may not think what you do is right
Just might hold it against you
No matter how hard you try and fight
Some still may resent you

Alright if it's coming
Straight from your heart
You knew where to start (straight from your heart)
Alright if it's coming
Coming, coming
Straight from your heart
Ooh, you knew where to start

I look around, it's clear to see
You need love just like me
I've seen enough to know by now
When love fails to show it, show somehow

Alright if it's coming
Alright if it's coming
Straight from your heart
Ooh, you knew where to start
Alright if it's coming
Coming, coming, coming
Straight from your heart
Ooh, you knew where to start

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Coming straight, coming straight
Coming straight, coming straight
From your heart

Can't entertain a fantasy
In such a neat reality
You can share your love now as you pass
Oh, if it's not too much to ask

Alright if it's coming
Alright, alright
Straight from your heart
You knew where to start
You knew where to start
Alright if it's coming
Let it come on, come on in
Straight from your heart
Ooh, you knew, you knew where to start

Let me see you coming, coming straight from your heart
(Straight from your heart)
Oh girl, you knew where to start
(Straight from your heart)
Always doing, doing your part
(Straight from the heart)
Let it keep coming, coming
(Straight from your heart)
'Cause you knew where to, where to, where to start
Let me see you coming, coming straight from your heart
(Let me see you coming straight, straight from your heart)
Always doing, doing your part
(Let me see you where it's coming straight from your heart)
Oh, it's doing your part
(Let me see you coming straight, straight from your heart)
Ooh, you brought it, you brought it
(Let me see you where it's coming straight from your heart)
Bring it, bring it on down
Mm, yeah, yeah
