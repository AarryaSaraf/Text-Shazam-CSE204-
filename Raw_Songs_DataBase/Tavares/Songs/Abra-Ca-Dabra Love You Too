Magic, I've got magic everyday that I'm alive
Something special since you've come to me girl

Teardrops, no more teardrops
That's a thing of the past
It's a mixed-up and a mystical world

All it took was just one wave of your hand
You changed my life with just one kiss

Like a genie in a bottle you appear
Right out of the blue
Abracadabra, love you too
Abracadabra, love you too

Stardust, I see stardust when I look in your eyes
So much sweetness in those ruby lips

Power, you've got power, get me under your spell
You've got heaven in your fingertips

Love this happiness waving down from above
You filled me with your precious love

Like a genie in a bottle you appear
Right out of the blue
Abracadabra, love you too
Abracadabra, love you too

It's impossible to measure all the love
Oh how I treasure what you are, you're my lucky star

I want to know whoever sent you
Someone out there must have met you

Give me a dream
Heaven knows I love you so
And I can't let go

Like a genie in a bottle you appear
Right out of the blue
Abracadabra, love you too
