It's real, even though you're with me all the time
No matter where you are
No one can steal your love
You gotta realize they won't get far

I can't give you up
No, no, not without a fight
Don't wanna let it up
Just got to hangin' tight
Come on and build me up
With your sweet, sweet lovin'
You got to set it up
Ain't no use in me running

'Cause there's nothing you can do
Could make me stop lovin' you, baby
Nothing you can say could make me turn away
Nothing you can do could make me stop lovin' you, baby
Nothing you can say could make me break away

You're mine
But I can't do a thing about it, no
It takes time to get there
And I just wanna sing about it, yeah

I can't give you up
No, no, not without a fight
Don't wanna let it up
Just got to hangin' tight
Come on and build me up
With your sweet, sweet lovin', yeah
You got to set it up
Ain't no use in running

'Cause there's nothing you can do
Could make me stop lovin' you, baby
Nothing you can say could make me turn away, yeah
Nothing you can do could make me stop lovin' you, baby
Nothing you can say could make me break away, yeah

'Cause there's nothing you can do
Could make me stop lovin' you, baby
Nothing you can say could make me turn away, yeah
Nothing you can do (nothing you can do)
Could make me stop (nothing you can say, yeah) loving you, baby
I'm gonna love you, girl
You never make me turn away, yeah

Ooh, ooh ooh
I can't give you up
Can't give you up, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Ooh, ooh ooh
Don't wanna let it up, no, no
Yeah, hey, hey, hey

Ooh ooh ooh
Come on and build me up
Come on and build me up
No, no, no, no, no
