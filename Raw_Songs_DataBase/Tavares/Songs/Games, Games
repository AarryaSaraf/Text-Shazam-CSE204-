Games, games is what the people constantly play
Games, games

Another heart fell by the wayside
One more love affair ended today
Somebody cried, 'cause someone said it was over
(They said it was over)
One was serious, but the other wanted to play

It's a merry go round of emotions
(Merry go round, merry go round of emotions)
A three-ring circus affair
You promise to light me with devotion (well and uh)
But she's in love with someone else

Oh, these games, games is what the people constantly play
Yet all of us, all of us still wanna be loved
Hey, games, games is what the people constantly play
Yet all of us, all of us still wanna be loved
Games, games

It's an everyday situation
(Everyday situation)
Somebody says how much someone fills their needs
But you might as well give out applications
(Give out applications)
Since everyone keeps changing up their seasonings

It's a hopeless ball of confusion
(Hopeless ball of confusion, hopeless ball of confusion)
Broken promises plays the leading role
And tears simply flow like a river
(Flow like a river)
Well and uh
Girl, tonight we're lovers, but tomorrow we're foes

Games, games is what the people constantly play
Oh yeah, oh yeah, baby
Yet all of us, yet all of us still wanna be loved
Hey, yeah, yeah
Games, games is what the people constantly play
Yet all of us, yet all of us still wanna be loved

Oh, games, games, that's what the people constantly play
Yet all of us, yet all of us still wanna be loved
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Games, games is what the people constantly play
Hey babe, hey baby, can you hear what I say?
Yet all of us, yet all of us still wanna be loved
Yeah, baby
Games, games is what the people constantly play
Don't play no games, baby
I don't need the problems
Yet all of us still wanna be loved
