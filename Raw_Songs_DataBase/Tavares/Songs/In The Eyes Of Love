We don't own a brand new car
A big fine house
Saying who we are
Never dreamed of what might be
We make the most of reality

But in the eyes of love
No-one could be richer that we are
In the eyes of love
Baby we have been making it so far

There are times when Friday comes
And the bills are paid
There are no great songs
So we stay home wooping up some rhymes
Simple things just suit me fine

But in the eyes of love
No-one could be richer that we are
In the eyes of love
Baby we have been making it so far

Now baby we may not have
All the money in the world
But what we do have is
Something so special and rare

But in the eyes of love
No-one could be richer that we are
In the eyes of love
Baby we have been making it so far
