Don't take away the music
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock

I knew you were always there
You were my song (you were my song)
How am I supposed to bear it
Now that you're gone

Would you separate the words
Ooh, from a sweet melody
Baby, would you take away
The music from a symphony

Don't take away (don't take away) the music (please)
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock
Don't take away (don't take away) the music (no)
Everything else is gone
Don't strip my world of its song

Every time you whispered low
My heart would sing (my heart would sing)
Now it's silent like a phone
The phone that never rings

Memories of love's refrain
Memories keep haunting me
What are we doing to the song we sang
What happened to our sweet harmony

Don't take away (don't take away) the music (please)
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock (don't take, don't take, you)
Don't take away (don't take away) the music (no)
Everything else is gone
Don't strip my world of its song

Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo (no, no, no)
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo (don't take away, oh love, please)
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo (leave me here with nothing)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Since you're not here with me
My whole life seems out of key

Don't take away (don't take away) the music (please)
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock (don't take, don't take, you)
Don't take away (don't take away, yeah) the music (please)
Everything else is gone
Don't strip my world of its song

Don't take away (don't take away) the music (no)
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Don't take away the music
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock
Don't take away (don't take away, yeah) the music (I love ya)
Everything else is gone
Don't strip my world of its song (don't take, don't take, you)

Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo (you got my heart, y'see)
Don't take my music, don't take it away (you're havin' fun)
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo (with no heart left in me, baby)
Don't take my music, don't take it away (since you been gone)

Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, don't take it away
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, don't take it away

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, don't take it away
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, don't take it away
Don't take my music
