Yeah, I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough
Yeah

Ain't no quitting time
Ain't no limit sign
On this love for you
You could write a book
'Cause you got me hooked
On the things you do

Maybe I should hold back some
And make you the one to cry
I should use some self-control
But this well just won't run dry

I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah

Pride should stop me cold
I've been told
How you play with me
Cat and mouse, I'm caught
'Cause I'm not
Where I ought to be

I should have the strength to go
Heaven knows I've tried
Your love's an addictive taste
One hit won't make me high

I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough (Yeah)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah

I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Well, well, well
I can't get enough
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I just can't get enough

'Cause in the lonely hour
In the power
Of such loneliness
As the minutes fly
My resistance dives
Down to nothingness

I should turn and go to sleep
Just let the night drift by
But I recall a love so sweet
It's no wonder why

I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough (Yeah)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, ooh

Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough, yeah)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Yeah

In the lonely hour (Yeah)
I can't get enough, yeah (Yeah)
I can't get no sleep (Yeah)
I can't get enough (Can't get enough, yeah)
(Yeah)

Heaven knows I've tried (Yeah)
I can't get enough, yeah (Yeah)
I can't get enough, yeah (Yeah)
I can't get enough
