What cream is to coffee?
What honey is to a bee?
What maple is to syrup?
Is what you are good to me?

If divided they weak, together they strong
Two of a kind can never be wrong

We fit to a tee, you and me
That is the way the whole world ought to be
Oh, we fit to a tee, you and me
We got together like a ship and the sea

What corn-bread means to black-eyed peas?
What chitlins mean to collard greens?
A perfect combination matches on a pair of jeans
Without the one the other don't shine
We even get a compatible sign

We fit to a tee, you and me
That is the way the whole world ought to be
Oh, we fit to a tee, you and me
We got together like the leaves on the tree

What is the moon if there ain't no sun?
Baby, two hearts are better than one

Oh, we fit to a tee, you and me
That is the way the whole world ought to be
Baby, we fit to a tee, yes-siree
We got together like a ship and the sea

We fit to a tee, you and me
That is the way the whole world ought to be
We fit to a tee, yes-siree
We got together like the leaves on the tree

We fit to a tee, you and me
That is the way the whole world ought to be
We fit to a tee, yes-siree
We got together like a ship and the sea...
