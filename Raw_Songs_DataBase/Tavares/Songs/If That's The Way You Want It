Oh, we've come to the end of our road
Somebody's gonna be goin' (I've got to be goin')
We've been trying just as hard as we can
But the emptiness is finally showing

If we let it go another day
There'll be only bitter words to say
And so we've worked out fine, we've laid it on the line
You're still a friend of mine

If that's the way that you want it
Oh baby, you got it
If that's the way that you see it
Oh darlin', so be it
I'll never give you a reason
To show me to the back door
If that's the way that you want it
Well, I've been there before

Well, I've taken a last look around (Look around)
And there's nothing I hope I'm forgetting (I've got to be goin')
If you happen to find my guitar
Then I'll let you know just where I'm headed

There's a little bit of you inside
I'll be taking along for the ride
I guess I feel the same, nobody is to blame
I'll go the way I came

If that's the way that you want it (You want it)
Oh baby (Oh baby)
You got it (You got it, you got it, you got it)
If that's the way that you see it (Oh, see it)
Oh darlin' (Oh, darlin')
So be it (So be it)
I'll never give you a reason (I'll never give you a reason)
To show me to the back door (No, no, no, no)
If that's the way that you want it
Well, I've been there before

It's pretty clear that I've been hanging on too long
And when I've ever been like this, I moved along
Well, girl, I won't stand in the way
I've worn my welcome out
I've been right here so many times
I know what I'm talking about
Hey, hey, hey, baby

If that's the way that you want it (You want)
Oh baby (Oh baby)
You got it (You got it, you got it, you got it)
If that's the way that you see it (Oh, see it)
Oh darlin' (Oh darlin')
So be it (So be it)
I'll never give you a reason (I'll never give you a reason)
To show me to the back door (No, no, yeah, yeah)
If that's the way that you want it
Well, I've been there before (Oh, yeah)

If that's the way that you want it
Oh baby (Oh baby)
You got it
If that's the way that you see it (You see it)
Oh darlin' (Oh darlin')
So be it (So be it)
I'll never give you a reason (I'll never give you a reason)
To show me (No)
