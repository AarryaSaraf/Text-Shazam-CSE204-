This is a song about you, baby
You know you keep me on a high
Don't you know your lovin' drives me crazy?
But I don't know the reason why
Sweet imaginary lover
You turn me on with so much ease
And what you do is undercover
You know you got me in deep freeze
So baby

Keep on doing what you're doing
Sending chills down my spine
Keep on doing what you do
'Cause what you're doing, baby, I need it all the time

You were so cool when I reacted
This mystery I can't explain
And I see a certain kind of magic
In everything you do and say
I just can't get enough of your loving
(You're the only one) Who spends the night
And I'll do my best to keep you happy
You give me love and I'm satisfied
So baby

Keep on doing what you're doing
Sending chills down my spine
Keep on doing what you do
'Cause what you're doing, baby, I need it all the time
(Baby)
Keep on doing what you're doing
Sending chills down my spine
Keep on doing what you do
'Cause what you're doing, baby, I need it all the time

I just can't get enough of your loving
(You're the only one) Who spends the night
And I'll do my best to keep you happy
You give your love and I'm satisfied
So baby

Keep on doing what you're doing
Sending chills down my spine
Keep on doing what you do
'Cause what you're doing, baby, I need it all the time
(Baby)
Keep on doing what you're doing
Sending chills down my spine
Keep on doing what you do
'Cause what you're doing, baby, I need it all the time
(Baby)
Keep on
