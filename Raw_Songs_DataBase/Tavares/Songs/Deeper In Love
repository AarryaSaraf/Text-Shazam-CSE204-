Keep falling deeper in love
Keep falling deeper in love

When it comes to love, I got to be for real
(I never hesitate to show just how I feel)
Once too often, my heart's been filled with pain
(And it seems I'll never learn to play the game)

Girl, in my deepest thoughts
How I wonder if your heart is true
There is a chance it's not
Still I just can't help thinking of you
And I

Keep falling deeper in love
Deeper in love, deeper in love with you
Keep falling deeper in love

At times, I ask myself just what I'm lookin' for
(Girl, I find it all in you and so much more)
There can be no doubt that you're the one I need
(Open eyes will see the signs are there to read)

I've got to find a way
To break through this dark cloud of indecision
My heart says play it safe
But I'd rather find out what I'm missing
So I

Keep falling deeper in love
Deeper in love, deeper in love with you
Keep falling deeper in love
Sinkin' deeper no matter what I do
Keep falling deeper in love
I won't let love slip through my hands again
Keep falling deeper in love
This time, I'm holdin' on to love, whoo

I'm falling deeper
Falling deeper

I was so lost in pride
So afraid one day I'd have to face rejection
But now I realize
That it hurts more to lock love inside
And I

Keep falling deeper in love
Deeper in love, deeper in love with you
Keep falling deeper in love
No matter what I do, I said, I
Keep falling deeper in love
Love's really got me hooked this time
Keep falling deeper in love
I'm falling deeper in love
I said, I
Keep falling deeper in love
Deeper in love, deeper in love
Keep falling deeper in love
I won't let love slip through my hands again
Keep falling deeper in love
Ooh
Keep falling deeper in love
Keep falling deeper in love
Keep falling deeper in love
