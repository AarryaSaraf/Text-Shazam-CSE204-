// Bitter Peace //

[Music & Lyrics: Hanneman]

Initiate blood purge
Coalition in massacre
Mechanized high tech
Whole sale death in effect
Mutually assured
Destruction will occur
Genocide revised
Same pain through diverse eyes
Can't stop the warring factions
Hostile from the start
Always war always
Ending bitter peace
Not the last third war
Blood spills for evermore
Patriot hard line
Lay siege till the end of time
No longer kill your brother
Just slaughter one another
Watch for the deadly other
This sibling is a fucker
Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension starts aggression
Peace breaks out then
Breeds contempt unrest

[Lead: Hanneman/King]

Without a reason to fight
A time to kill
Sick lust for skeletal flesh
A taste for all decay
Enter the soldier blind
Stalking the faceless hunt
There is no conscience in this world
That can be reached for peace
Why face the human question
The need to hate
Dead stare through cynical eyes
A trust in only pain
Murder within the skin
Engrave the art of war
Become death's vile parade
March on embrace the violent mind
Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension starts aggression
Peace breaks out then
Breeds contempt unrest
One cryptic reason for life murder

// Death's Head //

[Music & Lyrics: Hanneman]

Death's pointed at your head
Your mind's on the trigger pull it
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story
Scene of your rage
Death is not strange
Blood on the walls
You stand alone satisfied
I'll wake the silence in you
I'll shoot the violence
Terrified by the thought that you are all alone
Paralyzed by the fact that you are all alone
You're losing your mind, I'm losing control
You're losing your mind, as I bury your world
I'll wake the silence in you
I'll shoot the violence
I can't remember yet someone always seems to die
You are the reason why I became the chosen one
I've got the right
God makes no sense
I've got the right
I feel my back against the wall

[Lead: Hanneman]

Death's pointed at your head
Your mind's on the trigger pull it
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story
Scene of my rage
Scene of my rage
Death is your name
You're facing your grave
I taste your tears caress your face
I watch you lie insane
Dying for love
Praying to die
I want what's inside you
Dressed in your blood
You wear it well
Dying because I care
Your eyes are wide but you can't see
Rotting my lust away
I'll shoot the violence through you
And wake the part that's dead
I hate the silence in you
I want what's in your head

// Stain Of Mind //

[Music: Hanneman, Lyrics: King]

Imagine Humanity's decline
Step inside my stain of mind
Infesting superiority
Infectious immorality oh yea
Come worship the place no truths are told
Praise the land where sins are sold
No passion no love your faith evades
Never see yourself again that way
Death becomes your bride
Lifelessness invades your eyes
In fire baptized
All pain sifts through myu soul
You'll never feel greater misery
Master of my enemy
Let the purest stain of mind
Wash the virtue from your eyes
As one the collective unifies
Emanate a faithless shine
Forever creation has conceived
Birth of destruction spreads its wings oh yea
Chaotic rebirth a new domain
Re-live the sight the sound the pain
Erotic the taste of agony
Adorn the scars of inhumanity
This is what you see
Deep inside of me
Agony is life
Lechery is life
Godlessness is life
Purgatory magnified
In fire baptized
All pain sifts through my soul
You'll never feel greater misery
Master of my enemy
Let the purest stain of mind
Wash the virtue from your eyes
Enticing malevolence allures
Bastardize the clean and pure
Salvation forever crucified
I choose the other side oh yea
Entire, complete serenity
Injected intravenously
Transgression euphoric bliss divine
Initiate a timeless stain of mind
Blood will sterilize
In fire I baptized
All pain sifts through my soul
You'll never feel greater misery
Master of my enemy
Let the purest stain of mind
Wash the virtue from your eyes

// Overt Enemy //

[Music & Lyrics: Hanneman]

I breach your life
Indoctrinate
Police your thoughts
Ask why I hate
I lose control
When I see your face
Abusing power
I infiltrate
Continue lies
Then masturbate
I walk the line
I'll do no time
I hate your church
I'll burn your state
A bleeding heart
A seal of fate
There is no crime
Within my mind
I'll sell your life and preach your death
A wicked plan born of contempt
Bleeding my ideology through pain

[Lead: Hanneman]

Audacious plans
I calculate
A new world view
I'll re-instate
Don't cross my path
Or I'll see you burn
You'll meet your end
Find death alone
No grave to mark
The seds you've sown
You've pushed too far
My secrets I defend
I'll sell your life and preach your death
A wicked plan born of contempt
Bleeding my ideology through pain

[Lead: Hanneman]

Demonize what is feared profane architect
Skull and bones through the mind
Barbaric thoughts of old
Celebrate all unknown
At last the dead await
The die is cast for the meek
Inherit endless dead time
Smell the victims are near
consume the catalyst
Hunting masses for game
implanting septic thoughts
Reaping terror through words while
armed behind your back
Pseudo leaders betray
enslaving all of mankind
Cast out the Demi God
Dethrone the demagogue
Cast out the church God
I command your life
And I don't care
Let bullets rain
From everywhere
No suicide
Will save you from yourself

// Perversions Of Pain //

[Music: Hanneman, Lyrics: King]

You better learn my name
Cause I'm the one insane
And I'm a constant threat
You run in fear from my dark silhouette
Inside my violent mind
Chaos is all you'll find
Anarchy uncontained
Bear witness to the scorn of my campaign
Perversions of pain
Seep from my eyes
Into your brain
Visualize
Within my world of hate
Disruption I instate
Malicious entity
Defile and desecrate humanity
Alone they all will die
Corroding from inside
With no one left to save them
As I'm dancing on their fucking graves
Perversions of pain
Seep from my eyes
Into your brain
Visualize

[Lead: King]

Take a look into my mind
Where pleasure is refined
Endless burning holes
Of scarred souls
Step inside my world of hate
Where everything mutates
Your senses under siege
Ingest the virtues I feed
A higher level of pain
Is racing through my veins
There's nothing more intense
Than mental misery that I dispense
So follow right along
Observe a fresh new dawn
Of super sensation
My realm of torture stimulation
Perversions of pain
Seep from my eyes
Into your brain
Visualize
You better learn my name
Cause I'm the one insane
Inside my violent mind
Chaos is all you'll find
Within my world of hate
Disruption I instate
Alone they all will die
Corroding from inside
Follow right along
Observe a fresh new dawn
Racing through my veins
A higher level of pain
Higher level of pain
Higher level of pain

// Love To Hate //

[Music: Hanneman, Lyrics: Hanneman & King]

Enter my mind can you stop the rage
No one shall mourn or pity my grave
Fighting the world without remorse
Searching for blood to never grow old
A personal hell is where I reside
Taunting death sounds cadavers in pain
Judging my soul I am not his son
Screaming God's name I want some more
You love to hate me
But you won't kill me
Suicidal surge
Desensitize the world
Take what I want primordial ground
Humanity bleeds from inside my veins
Losing all grasp an evil so old
Vengeance it breeds driving you insane
Exhaust all will hanging by the neck
Anguish within let it blind the eys
Better off dead is your epitaph
Apathy feeds the human demise
Absolute reign a malevolent mind
Conceptions so vile in this bottomless soul
Shooting up hate nothing beats the rush
Total addicting, corrupt and profane
Force-fed lies in this chapel of lust
Dancing in blood disciples enslaved
Putrefied walls adorned with your flesh
Coating this shrine of the ungodly cross
You love to hate me
But you won't kill me
Suicidal surge
Desensitize the world

[Lead: King]

Pessimistic dreams
Realistic screams
Crucify creation
Magnify damnation
Enter my mind can you stop the rage
No one shall mourn or pity my grave
Fighting the world without remorse
Searching for blood to never grow old
Putrefied walls adorned with your flesh
Coating this shrine of the ungodly cross
You love to hate me
But you won't kill me
Suicidal surge
Desensitize the world

// Desire //

[Music: Hanneman, Lyrics: Araya]

No one could ever doubt my rapture
As you too wil son discover
No one will ever cross my love
Deadly consequence will rise above
Lying all alone
Visions of erotic bliss
Feel your warmth from inside your skin
A fever I can not resist
Desire I would kill for you
Right or wrong I'd do anything
True and pure the intensity
Every time death is next to me
Lying all alone
Visions of erotic bliss
Feel your warmth from inside your skin
A fever I can not resist

[Lead: Hanneman/King]

Anxiously feeling grotesque
Up against your flesh
Forbidden fantasies
Uncontrollable heat
Find yourself all alone and dead
Visions of corroding bliss
Feel the warmth from inside your skin
A sensation I can't resist

// In The Name Of God //

[Music & Lyrics: King]

I want to
Invite you
Welcome you
To my hate
To my scorn
To myself
Saturate you
Infest you
Betray you
Stimulate you
So eager for my lies

For my lies... Lies

Lies in the name of God

[Lead: King]

I take you
I play you
Invade you
Lacerate you
I scar your
Innocence
Masticate you
Ingest you
Become you
Defenseless
I fill your emptiness

With my lies... Lies

Lies in the name of God
In this world of shit I exist
Perfect world conforms I resist
Disconnect the nerves from the spine
Desecrate the walls of the mind
Through these eyes no love is alive
Through these eyes unrest never dies
Through these lies compassion is lost
Through these lies await the Ungod
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God

[Lead: King]

// Scrum //

[Music: Hanneman, Lyrics: King]

No blood no glory
All pain and fury
A demonstration
Of domination
Show of pure intimidation

[Lead: King]

Full contact why I live and breathe
Side stepping all the human debris
Head strong I know that I'll prevail
Face down in my arena you will fail
Head to head eye to eye
Human pile of proven pride
Ripping flesh spitting teeth
Sacrifice for victory
Base line  Goal line
Overtime   Killing time
Relentless brotherhood of discipline
Centuries of tradition is to win
Head first into battle feel the rush
Living on adrenaline your try is crushed

[Lead: King]

No blood  No glory
All pain  And fury
Head to head eye to eye
Human pile of proven pride
Ripping flesh spitting teeth
Sacrifice for victory
Base line  Goal line
Overtime   Killing time

// Screaming From The Sky //

[Music: Hanneman, Lyrics: Araya, Hanneman & King]

I stalk close in from above
Silent wings will test your faith
Death will never hear me pass
Launch attack you're too late
I hear flak inside my head
Deafening thunder cities burn
Carpet-bombing laid to waste
Throwned inside a death mask
Holy cross embedded in your tomb
Casualities are buried through your mind
Certain death is screaming from the sky
I live to destroy below
Hunted victims are unseen
Flying wrath a fortress hell
War machine to kill all
I leave carnage in my wake
Choking bleeding for your life
Faceless prey has been erased
Silence reigns you're dead now
Holy cross embedded in your tomb
Casualities are buried through your mind
Certain death is screaming from the sky

[Lead: King]

Listen to the rhythm of a dead man walking
Silent is the heartbeat of the predator stalking
Hear the sound of air feel the warmth touch your neck
Reality is not fair no time to second guess
Hear the distant ringing of the blade as it cuts your neck
Silent is the cry lying on your mattress of blood
An easy mark for a veteran of execution
I walk step by step with death
Where all bludgeoned bodies lie
You will see my face of rage
Cut your heart out of your chest
Leave impaled the consummation of mankind

// Point //

[Music: Hanneman, Lyrics: King]

I'm the one that brings you war
Infiltrate unguarded shores
Master of afflicting pain
Point is where all die

[Lead: King]

I'm the one to taste your blood
Trashing through the crimson mud
Messenger of all demise
Point is where I reign
Piercing, impaling, no judgement, just punishment
Discreate, annihilate assault with no regret
I'm the one to taste your death
Basking in your dying breath
Messenger of all demise
Point is where all die
Piercing, impaling, no judgement, just punishment
Discreate, annihilate assault with no regret
Born to kill sweep and clear
taring down the face of fear
Shrapnel flies dehumanize
Flesh and blood will ferilize
Empty all the magazines
Lethal spray form M-16's
Pace the march and sing the song
Right the fuck where I belong
Stained in blood
No fear - no sound
Penetrate your holy ground
Leave you where your comrades lie
Point is where all die
Pure destruction has begun
Fearlessly the battle's won
Spread extinction through the dawn
Signature of wrath is spawned
Minister of death unreleased
My lust for war will never cease
With no remorse I watch you die
Body count's the bottom line
Crashing slashing to the end
Your final pulse has just been spent
Leave you where your comrades lie
Point is where all fucking die

[Lead: Hanneman]

Crashing slashing to the end
Your final pulse has just been spent
Leave you where your comrades lie
Stained in blood
No fear - no pain - no life

[Lead: King]

Clouded skies rain only death
Silence all opposing threats
Quench the hunger of my gun
Exploding cites overrun
I'm the one to taste your death
Basking in your dying breath
Messenger of all demise
Point is where all die

// Wicked //

[Music: Hanneman & King, Lyrics: Araya & Bostaph]

Cataract blinding your eyes
To the violent design
Regenerating impending genocide
It's the dawn of decay
Mark the end of your days
Just another lost casualty of the times

The wicked will feed the chaos
Control and rule disorder
Disintegration's multiplying
Till there is no more bloodline
A future of neverending
Insane civil disorder
Free yourself from the red dawn
The time has come

Death's head shattering
Blow to the throat
At the end of the rope
Degeneration that follows into the fire
In a world gone insane
No one else left to blame
Your just another part of the collective vile

The wicked will feed the chaos
Control and rule disorder
Disintegration's multiplying
Till there is no more bloodline
A future of neverending
Insane civil disorder
Free yourself from the red dawn
The time is now

Era of total destruction has slowly begun
Yielding death none will survive
Order out of chaos the true will of the Beast
A life of desolation

Ten bleeding hearts
One wicked mind
In spiritual sin
Their time is now

Era of total destruction has slowly begun
Yielding death none will survive
Order out of chaos the true will of the Beast
A life of desolation

Ten bleeding hearts
One wicked mind
In spiritual sin
Their time is now

Famine, plagues, war and death
scourges preceding the end
Death is your only savior

Ten bleeding hearts
One wicked mind
In spiritual sin
Their time is now
Bringing total annihilation

// Unguarded Instinct //

Use the need, lose control,
Hidden voice inviting,
Imposing will, unconscious skill
Embraced immoral passion.
Born is still, thirst for thrill,
Indulgence of illusion.
Neurotic, psychotic,
Dead silent screams, come alive.

Killing seed, first degree,
I shut the world outside.
Denied and laid to waste,
The body and soul divide.

A final thrill, a timely kill
Unbound, unguarded.
Fantasized, realized,
Enforced upon the dying.
Free reign of the asylum,
Archaic energy thrives,
Dead cold, I control
Eternal screams that slowly die.

Killing spree, first degree.
I shut the world outside.
Denied and laid to waste,
The body and soul divide.

Dimentia born of sin,
A symptom that begins,
Vengeance so divine.

Lost my grip of what's real.
Unrestrained self-induced vertigo.
Manic power chills my spine.
I can't erase this instinct I embrace.

Two faced moral abandon,
Races my blood boils my skin.
Unhinging the doorway to this asylum,
Releasing unshackled poison dreams.
Beginning the end of temptation.
A vengeance so divine.
The end of temptation,
A vengeance so divine.

Killing spree, first degree,
I shut the world outside.
Denied and laid to waste,
The body and soul divide.
