// World Painted Blood //

Disease spreading death
Entire population dies
Dead before you're born
Massive suicide
Vicious game of fear
It's all extermination now
Poison in your veins
Global genocide
Slaughter governs law
The apocalypse begins
Pain becomes the norm
Seeking homicide
Beware the coming storm
That starts illuminating fires
God is laughing hard
Man has gone insane

World painted blood
No sanctuary
World painted blood
No sanctuary

Tip the human scale
Follow revelations plan
It must come to pass
Secret shadows lie
Blue print haunting dreams
In which manipulation wins
Speak no hidden fears
Religion neutralized
Emerged from the dark
Sadist mercenary ride
Realm of this world
Godless messengers
Sickless, mindless hate
Becoming evolution's cure
Planets usher in alignment
God has died

World painted blood
No sanctuary
World painted blood
No sanctuary

God send death, watch it bleed, justified
Manufactured lives born in hell
Angels fall, wings on fire, crucified
Terrorizing man, burn the world
Reflecting eyes, sickle swings, wave of blood
Suicidal mind from the start
Endless pain, open wounds, slit the throat
Radiation child seeks the throne

Strafing down demigods certain death
Coming from the stars, lord of all
Dark rift rise, flourish life, perish man
We destroy ourselves, cease to live
Children's blood feed the dead sea of flesh
Catastrophic fall rest in hell
Flaming corpse, screaming eyes, watch it die
Walk among the dead, pick your grave

[x4]
Like a disease spreading death
Erasing your existence

Satan's hand begins the end
And frees the world forever
Gomorrah's dream to live in sin
Has reached its critical mass
Man himself has become God
And laughs at his destruction
In which we trust a secret government
Is now in total collapse

Disease spreading death
Entire population dies
Dead before you're born
Massive suicide
Vicious game of fear
It's all extermination now
Poison in your veins
Global genocide
Slaughter governs law
The apocalypse begins
Pain becomes the norm
Seeking homicide
Beware the coming storm
That starts illuminating fires
God is laughing hard
Man has gone insane

World painted blood
No sanctuary
World painted blood
No sanctuary

Signs of disease, rivers red, blood in ice, plague
Signs of disease, rivers red, blood in ice, plague
Signs of disease, rivers red, blood
Welcoming our death

// Unit 731 //

I am the last of the dying insane
You would scream at the things I've done
Knowing that the dead still see
My blood it runs like mercury

Your last breath the sword comes down
She dies first speaking death to me
Philosophy, the vision, the view within
Duty, science, abstract cruelty

[Chorus:]
What are your final thoughts?
Do you want to kill me or die in shame?
From my point of view
Justified action, the enemy burns

The fun of massacre in the brain
Bioweapons and I are the same
Look at their face, hatred in their blood
Pile up the dead, my humanity

X-rays burn all that you can see
Nobody knows what a body can stand
Skulls on fire yet mercy is worse
You seek only your pleasure in death

[Chorus]

Bacterial target, eyes exploding
Melting flesh through your mind
Become your madness insanity wins
Infant's flesh on the walls
Testing limits threshold of pain
Ripping out teeth to observe
I want blood

[Lead: Hanneman]
[Lead: King]

[x4]
Knowing now the dead still see
My blood it runs like mercury

Human brain experiment
On prisoners open skull
Vivisection, live dissection
Repulsing to the core

[Chorus]

Fuckin' burns

Pathogens seek horrible end
Churning factories of death
Crematoriums see your crime
You will see me in hell

// Snuff //

[Lead: Hanneman]
[Lead: King]

Start with vanity
Arrogance and greed
Panic is my obsession
No one can escape

The thrill is much too great
Despair is my creation
Everything obscene
Emanates from me

Homicide is on the rise
It all begins now
Take your final bow
The camera never lies

Action, torture, misery
Endless suffering
Torment, agony

Captured for eternity
Action
You're the main attraction

Torture, misery
Endless suffering
Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny

No one else around
Razor wire bound
Insanity is so near
Heart begins to seize

Watch you atrophy
Reality is now clear
Take a look inside
Many more have died

The internet's an open door
Everyone can see
Dying brutally
The audience begs for more

Action, torture, misery
Endless suffering
Torment, agony

Captured for eternity
Action
You're the main attraction

Torture, misery
Endless suffering
Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny

[Lead: King]

Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future

Torture, misery
Endless suffering
Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny

[Lead: King]

Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future

Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future

Murder is my future

// Beauty Through Order //

It's the feel of your blood
As it flows smoothly down my skin
Intoxicating my soul
Immortality, seducing me

Burning in your own hell, which now binds you to me infinitely
Spirits of angels don't weep for you enticing me
Vanity, blood
Left for you to drink

Eternity waits for you
Vanity, blood
Left for you to drink
Eternity waits for you to drink

Frozen in time is the ice flowing in your veins
Are you insane?
At your mercy they suffered while you sat there painless
Vile and shameless

Crowned you are now for the merciless sins
It's the end
Your beauty through order is where blood flows through you
Where it begins

Vanity, blood
Left for you to drink
Eternity waits for you
Vanity blood

Left for you to drink
Eternity waits for you to drink
Young life striped down of all it's dignity
Sliced flesh pours out it's youthfulness

My lust will never be fully quenched
Your screams tell me that you're not prepared to die

[Lead: King]

Creature from hell why can't you see the things I see?
Mirror tells me that you were always meant for me
You are my sacrifice
Blood is the deficit

Biting the flesh, face my sick prelude
Now meet your frozen death
God did not do this
Heated iron bar I will insert inside your cunt

Mistress of cruelty, a name that will not die
You are my sacrifice
Blood is the deficit
Bathing in blood, your heart, your soul, your god

It all belongs to me
God belongs to me
It all belongs to me

[Lead: Hanneman]

Murder is my birthright the bloodline proves aristocracy
Walled in, left for dead, your actions show no hypocrisy
My birthright, is murder
Birthright, murder

Birthright, murder

// Hate Worldwide //

I stab you right between the eyes
You awaken from the lies
I said it ever since the inception
Where the masters of deception
I'm a godless heretic
Not a god-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection

My scars insane, my life profane
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

Like a storm that devastates
Religious power instigate
Take religion to my confession
There is no filter on my aggression
With a blister open wide
To keep the massacre alive
I got cold devastation
With my moral imperfection

My scars insane, my life profane
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

Religious death, I instigate
From what the bible demonstrates
Does it document creation
Of this hopeless infliction
Of a godless heretic
Not a god-fearing lunatic
Not a god-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection

My scars insane, my life profane
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

Open life scars, crushing open wounds
The walls of this scene will be crashing at you
You left senseless mentally unfit
Never fucking heard from you again
Never fucking heard from again

// Public Display Of Dismemberment //

Anarchy, disarray this is the world today
Justice is a lie for the followers to get by
No peace, only guns, can't trust anyone
Live or die it's an eye for an eye

Unrest, marshal law, society decays
And it's safe to say there is no other way
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
Public display of dismemberment

Blameless innocent, lies of the decadent
Brazen hypocrites answering to idiots
New tax, market crash, high life never lasts
No quick fix, for broken politics

Unrest, marshal law, society decays
And it's safe to say there is no other way
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
Public display of dismemberment

[Lead: Hanneman]

Aftermath of tolerance judgement is defined
Individual pain is a strong incentive
Infiltrate with fear keeping penance ever near
Punish with indecency and mutilate for all to see

[Lead: King]

Disarray, no quick fix, for broken politics
Anarchy, live or die it's an eye for an eye

Unrest, marshal law, society decays
And it's safe to say there is no other way
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
Public display of dismemberment

// Human Strain //

Illness, infected born mutilated strain
Issue transfusion no one left to blame
Nature's way of thinning out the human fucking herd

Disease, to war to fear his own kind
The human strain, returning plague
Drink the tainted blood
From the only child

Cities, increase speed population rise
Dying, the future process in the genes
Death stalking man as he embraces the absurd
Through peace, through life, the hatred of himself

The human strain, returning plague
Drink the tainted blood
From the only child
Death stalking man though peace, through life, though hatred of himself

Death stalking man, as he embraces his crucifixion
Skinless resurrection, from the bodies of the dead
Sickness is increasing, as the oceans turn red

Apparatus for self destruction, day of judgement is now at hand
Decayed memories haunt vaccinated minds
Risk contamination mechanism of death
Anyone left alive scorch turn to ash

Disease, war black death touching man
The human strain, returning plague
Drink the tainted blood
From the only child

// Americon //

With our callous minds we infect
Other ways of life no regrets
Like a masochist we instigate
While the rest of the world must tolerate

Americon, it's all about the mother fucking oil
Regardless of the flag upon it's soil
In a blood bath we pad our fucking greed
The price is high to maintain liberty

Americon, so here we live in a land of deceit
That imprison the minds of the weak
No immunity for swaying the odds
From this resistance strain americon

Americon, some feel the need to play god
No immunity for swaying the odds
From this resilient plague americon

[Lead: Hanneman]
[Lead: King]

With our poison minds we infest
Other ways of life we ingest
In a blood bath we steal you dignity
The price is high to maintain liberty

Americon

// Psychopathy Red //

Body count
Laid out mutilated
It's your time to die
Desolate
Lure kill satisfaction
Climax with your death
All alone
My prey intimidated
Feed my lust for fear
Dehumanise
Cry out stimulated
Your screams fill my soul

Systematic death
A physical fear
Psychopathy red
After death gratification

Graphic dreams
Played out insatiable
Can't control the urge
Innocence
Drop dead suicidal
A pain that I posses
Vindictive
Past crimes insidious
This is my redemption
Violate
Force down penetrate
Your eyes reflecting horror

Systematic death
A physical fear
Psychopathy red
After death gratification

Perversion
Slow death agonizing
Stab around the eyes
Flow of blood
Warm taste brings me pleasure
Eclipsing all reason
Pushing sperm
In her imitation
Painful act in vain
Organs cooked, bled out potency
Now I am complete

Systematic death
A physical fear
Psychopathy red
After death gratification

// Playing With Dolls //

I never thought the taste of you
Would be the only thing to make me bleed
Why am I, so alive
While you lie still in the ground beneath me?

Fear of death the dark inside
Have become your only children
They're in front of you, watching you
Lost screams unholy dreams unrest

I laugh at your god as he's passing through
Slicing at your throat to warm my skin
Never thought it'd come to this
Fuck I've gone wrong no rest

Your children still call
Can't you hear them screaming out your name?
You've gone insane, they're in my head
They want you to, die in front of me, die in front of me

Thinking why me?
Wishing this was all a dream
Insanity, reality, you're going to
Die in front of me

Pestilence is here, death awaits, your body is not of Christ
It's my alter, helpless and alone, violate, enveloped in my skin
Faceless canvass, tearing all your flesh, bathed in blood
Violently regress, death's so endless, brutal is your pain

Anguish is a game, broken and afraid, god can't help you now
You'll wish your in hell, ghostly figures are always standing still
Are they mocking me, what do they see?
I didn't want your death to end so fast, but once you start, you cannot stop

I need it now, to fucking last, die in front of me
Die in front of me, thinking why me?
Wishing this was all a dream, insanity, reality
You're going to

Die in front of me, pestilence is here, death awaits
Your body is not of Christ
It's my alter, brutal is your pain, anguish is a game
Broken and afraid, god can't help you now

[Lead: Hanneman]

You'll wish your in hell, I never thought the taste of you
Would be the only thing to make me bleed, all alone in my
Funeral home, playing in blood there's just got to be
Something's wrong with me, draining veins, it's all the same

The torture in my head, it won't stop, until I am fucking dead
Pestilence is here, death awaits, your body is not of Christ
It's my alter, helpless and alone, violate, enveloped in my skin
Faceless canvass, tearing all your flesh, bathed in blood

Violently regress, death's so endless, brutal is your pain
Anguish is a game, broken and afraid, god can't help you now
You'll wish your in hell

// Not Of This God //

Awake each day, to propaganda
Complacency, conformity
Relentless madness they regurgitate
So save your breath, you can't coerce the strong with verbal warfare

Defending, bludgeoning, to succumb to Christ or they will
Watch you fucking burn, these apocalyptic predators must die
Everyone til none are left alive, I'll eradicate the weak
Within this war, cos I'm the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god

[Lead: Hanneman]

Replicate, like a virus that infects with disease
The beckoning pestering, don't preach to me with your blasphemy
Exterminate, the bottom dweller on your fear they prey
There's symmetry in anarchy, believe the lies or they will watch you

Fuckin' burn, these apocalyptic predators must die
Everyone til none are left alive, I'll eradicate the weak
Within this war, cos I'm the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god
False god, sorcerer, free thought torturer, embedded in the mind of the masses

Outcast, conjurer, spineless provocateur, engulfed in narcissistic madness
No need to feel so hollow, a promise of no sorrow, you call him the messiah
I seek a deviant pariah

[Lead: King]

Holy water empty threat, the holy cross has no effect
I piss on any object of virtue, crucifix and rosaries
A world of insecurities, keep waiting for your soul to be rescued
You'll see no bright tomorrow, a promise of more sorrow

You call him the messiah, I see a reckless fashion based on metal slavery

[Lead: King]

You are the tainted, I am the pure, you are the sickness
I am the cure, a toxic threat of your non sense, I feed
I'll be the one to bring Christ to his knees, crucify then ridiculed again
A target for all time, until the end

I'll expose a total inconsistencies, and wallow in my heresy
Cos I am the fucking weapon, attacker of their ideology
Intoxicate with rationality, these apocalyptic predators must die
Cos I am the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god
