// Disintegration / Free Money //

Disintegration you bastard

I've done overdose it doesn't mean shit
One time what about you it doesn't bother me a bit
My body is a weapon and my mind is decay
And all you stupid assholes are here to see me die

Disintegration [6x]

I don't need you now so why don't you go away
Your day will come real soon and your mind will be
And everyone will fuck you, you're such a fucking whore
And when I see you standing there
I just don't want no more

Disintegration [6x]

Free Money

I don't want your problem
Sopping all the time
I can't even go
When I don't even have the time

I want everything and every thing wants me
I want everything and every thing comes out of me

I want free money [4x]

Life is slavery working 9 to 5
Waste your time working
You might as well die

I want everything and every thing wants me
I want everything and every thing comes out of me

Life is slavery working 9 to 5
Waste your time working
You might as well die

// Verbal Abuse / Leeches //

What do you expect I'm doing up here
What's with you what's the problem
You will always treat me obscene
Who cares if they make sense

You went and sat there and broke their bottles
You rip the seam off the bottom of their jackets
But you won't even know what are there

You're shit

Verbal abuse
I get into trouble
Verbal abuse
Burn me, I'll do it again
Verbal abuse
It's totally your fault
Verbal abuse
I guess you want some more

Leeches

Listen to her try to suck me dry
Problem with you you're afraid to die
They'll come around again and again
But in the end I know I'll win

There's no preference

Fuck this lets just kill them dead
Fuck with this discussion
Fuck this lets just kill them
Well well what the fuck

The worst thing has been done to you
That dumb ass will blow you away
No one now is getting dead

You won't feel a thing
Or your body's life you were fighting for

Got one now is dead
Got another that makes two
Got one more that is three
Don't cross me no more or you're dead

Problem with you you're afraid to die
They'll come around again and again
But in the end I know I'll win

Fuck this let's just kill them dead
Smash their head
Kill them all
Oh well, oh what, oh once and for all

// Abolish Government / Superficial Love //

Abolish government
There's nothing to it
Forget about God
He's no innocent
We live by a system
Of perfect goals
People vs. people who are bored and old

Life must rest on the man who represents

Looking for nothing in this
Campus with just friends
President the name
President the label
The highest man on the government table

Superficial love only for a fuck
But love is incest and it's only for a fuck
To the guys provided free
Peace time war time country's in vein

All die for this land some over seas
I live for the summons serve my country
Army, Navy, Air Force or jail
To the guys provided for free
Peace time war time country's in vein

But that's the American way what it is to be free
If that's what they call freedom it's not for me

Suck my motherfuckin' dick

// Can't Stand You //

Can't stand -
The way you look
The way you talk
The way you act
Can't stand you

Do I think -
You're a dick - Yeah
You're a fuck - Yeah
We'll fight - Yeah

Do I think you'll win - No

Do I think you're stupid - Yeah
Do I think you're lame - Yeah
Am I stressing
You're the one to blame

[Repeat intro.]

I open my mouth at the wrong time
Always ranking on somebody
I'm drunk all the time
Throwing beer bottles and spitting in your face
Checking through the purse
Of the slut in our place

She'll never notice if her money is gone
Piss in her jacket
And just send her along

[Repeat intro.]

// Ddamm (Drunk Drivers Against Mad Mothers) //

Swerving through the street
Drunk as fuck
Searching for a open store
I think I'm out of luck
Maybe I'll find a mad mother on patrol

Hit her car
Smash it up
Pull her out
Beat her up
Take her money
Run her down

Can't find any beer
It's way past two
There's just one thing we can do

Hit her car
Smash it up
Pull her out
Beat her up
Take her money
Run her down
Drive her face out of town

Drunk drivers against mad mothers

// Guilty Of Being White //

[Ian MacKaye / Jeff Nelson / Lyne Preslar / Brian Baker]

I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
Lynched somebody
But I didn't know who

You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years before I was born

Guilty of being white [4x]

[repeat intro]

Guilty of being white [4x]

I'm convicted
Of a racist crime
I've only served
19 years of my life

[repeat intro]

Guilty of being white [3x]
Guilty of being right

// I Hate You //

You were just a waste of sperm
They way you look
Makes my stomach turn
The way you think
Is no way at all

God you really think you have balls

I hate you
Ain't it true
I hate you
And everything you do

You walk around like a fucking dick
And everytime you're near
You know I get real sick

You're so stupid
There's nothing in your head
God how I wish that you were dead

I hate you
Ain't it true
I hate you
And everything you do

[Repeat intro.]

// Filler / I Don't Want To Hear It //

What happened to you
You're not the same
Something inside your head made a violent change

She cost you your life
She'll never leave your side
She's gonna be your wife

It's in yor head [3x]
Filler

Your brain is clay
What's going on?
You picked up a bible
And now your gone

I Don't Want to Hear It

I don't want to hear it

Then you're telling lies

I know you're full of shit [4x]

Ah, shut the fuck up

// Spiritual Law //

It's time to be born again
Don't talk about sex that's a sin
Confess your evils to the man
He'll do everything he can
Don't go mass you'll go to hell
We'll all be there it'll be swell

Pulling your lives
With such lies
Weak don't survive

We're being sucked up
Into the vacuum culture
This way this way
It's too late
Your addicted
Come on control yourself
Snatch that bottle off the shelve

You're trapped now with spiritual law
Spiritual law

Fiddle with your rosaries
Holy water only makes me bleed
Touch that cross to my head
It may burn but I won't be dead

To burn your rosaries
To burn it all
Death to us all

It is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late, you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside Daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

Your hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it
There's one chance left
Get on your knees drink the wine
Chew the wafer

People screaming can I be dreaming
Is this the truth I can't tell
Whether this is heaven or hell
Wolfbane and the sound of a silver bell

The air is thick
The smell of death is everywhere
It's all around
But I won't submit to death
You can go with the

Man don't lie why do they cry [3x]

Ruling your lives
With such lies
Weak won't survive

It is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

You're hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it

It's not too late [2x]

Spiritual law
No way
I want to see Christ today [4x]

// Sick Boy //

Well I'm searching through my bed
I got ankles in my head
I'm in really bad
It's the best time I ever had

I'm a sick boy
I'm a sick boy - there should be more

Well I'm happy the way I am
A sardine in a can
People taking notes
People in white coats

I'm a sick boy
I'm a sick boy - there should be more

Well I'm happy the way I am
And I'm sorry I shit on my hand
People taking notes
People in rubber coats

I'm a sick boy
Just a sick boy
I'm a sick boy

There's assholes everywhere
Plus girls with big town hair
But why must I suffer
For being a fecal lover

I'm a shit boy
I'm a shit boy - there should be more

// Mr. Freeze //

Will you be the lucky one,
who will see the deadly one?
You will die on your knees,
by the hand of Mr. Freeze.

Will you see when the rest are blind?
Will you remain frozen in time?

Will you flee underground?
Watch the blanket search the ground.
You will die on your knees,
by the hand of Mr. Freeze.

Horror awaits for those who evade.
Ice cold blood, stops in their veins.

Arm yourselves to the "T".
Repel the threat of Mr. Freeze.
See the blood drop in your eyes.
See your family burned alive.

I don't even know you.
I just know where you live.
I've raided your child's bedroom.
Burned his virgin skin.
I'd crucify your nation.
I'll leave your dead to rot.
I'll praise your damaged street.
And bear an iron cross.

The oceans have been ripped away.
It does no good to pray.
All todays cataclysm.
Men restore to cannibalism.

I'm worth all you'd care for,
Then I'll fuck you in the ass.
Oh so fucking happy,
As I kick your face and laugh.
Todays war stories,
At night I can hear you scream.
There's blood on your pillow.
This is no bad dream.
You try to think of reason,
And all you can do is scream!

// Violent Pacification //

Forces united the choice is yours [4x]

Violent pacification [2x]

Forces united the choice is yours [4x]

Violent pacification [5x]

We'll force you to be nice to each other
Kill you before you kill each other

Violent pacification [2x]

We'll force you to be nice to each other
Kill you before you kill each other

Violent pacification [repeat till end]

Run on sun

// Richard Hung Himself //

Needles stabbed into the walls
The executioners curtain call
Fighting back he found his identity
And there was no way out

Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With slashing, and stabbing, and maiming and ramming

Death threw his black curtains
Where his clothes once lied
The roof kicked out and the rope tied to the rafters
A quick kick of the chair
And it was all through
If Richie only knew

Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With needles, injecting and shooting subcutaneously

His life suddenly flashed right before his eyes
What a swinging guy
Turning gray with mold
This is when he died

Give it up [x2]
Throw it all away

Burning acid bath
Pulmonary wrath
Feel the boiling surge
It won't let you go

Throw it all away [2x]
Throw it all a... [2x]
Throw it all away

Swinging in his room
Richie won't come out to play
That poor bastard hung himself the other day
Oh how the years seem to fly by
Is death the final high

'Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With slashing and stabbing and ripping
And stabbing and shredding and slashing
And shredding and stabbing and ripping
And tearing attacking and maiming
And taking the body that god gave to you

I gotta get out

'Cause Richard hung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)
'Cause Richard swung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)
'Cause Richard strung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)
The needle, it stung itself ('cause Richard hung himself)
They pulled him right off the fucking shelf ('cause Richard hung himself)
That poor bastard, man he hung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)

To fucking think of himself

// I'm Gonna Be Your God (I Wanna Be Your Dog) //

I'm all jacked up
I want you here
In my room I want you dear

And now it's time to bury my face
Between your legs
With my tongue in that special place

Now I'm gonna be your God
Now I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your God

Now I'm ready to close my eyes
To feel that warm deep throat action
Now I'm ready to make you cum
And fuck like dogs all night long

Now I'm gonna be your God
Now I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your fucking God

I'm all jacked up
I want you here
In my room
I want you dear

Now I'm ready to make you cum
And fuck like dogs all night long

I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your fucking God

// Gemini //

[(Music: King, Lyrics: Araya) (C)1996 Molosser Music / SS810 Music ASCAP]

Endure the pain
You know my name
I am your soul insane

I am no one
No one who cares
I am your soul despair

Your fear deceives
Vulnerability
Leaving an easy prey

Consume your mind
A power so divine
Will take you and rape you blind

Gemini master of demise
Your death is my salvation
To a kingdom mine
My lord is my light
The master of darkness
Your death is my salvation
To a kingdom mine

You look at me with eyes of fate
And see the graphic truth

Your ignorance cannot shield you
From your naked abuse
Numbling of your moral sense
Facing reality
That life is unconditional
And death is only the beginning

The pain will never end...

Walking slow, breathing heavy
You could see death sweat
How it shined
An argument out of control in my mind

I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Walking slow breathing heavy
You can see death sweat.

I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Look into my eyes and see the revelation of your demise
Feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart
Reflections of my soul
Reflections of the dark

// Memories Of Tomorrow //

Bombers in flight
Trident missiles in the air
My missiles undergroung
Protect us till we're dead

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

Push the button
Kiss good-bye the nuclear arsenal
A bomber flying off their ramps
Nuclear bombs explode

Radio active people
Search for medicine
Pray for shelter
Kill for food

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

Mass starvation
Contaminated water
Destroyed Cities
Mutilated bodies

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

I'll kill myself
I'd rather die
If you could see in the future
You'd know why

Memories of tomorrow
