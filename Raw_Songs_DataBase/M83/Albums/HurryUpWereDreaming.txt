Album: HurryUpWereDreaming

// Intro //

We didn't need a story, we didn't need a real world
We just had to keep walking
And we became the stories, we became the places
We were the lights, the deserts, the faraway worlds
We were you before you even existed

I carry on, carry on, carry on
And after us the flood
Carry on, carry on, carry on
Our silver horn it leads the way
Banners of gold. Shine
In the cold, in the cold, in the cold
Footprints of snow
Blind from the road
Hail!

We carry on, carry on
Follow us, we are one
The battle's fought, the deed is done
Our silver hum runs deep and strong
Hand to the heart, lips to the horn
We can save, we can be reborn
Hand on my breast, I'll keep you warm
Hail!

// Midnight City //

Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
At night the night city grows
Look at the horizon glow

Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Drinking in the lights
Following the neon signs

Waiting for a word
Looking at the milky skyline
The city is my church (city is my church)
It wraps me in its blinding twilight

Waiting in a car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Waiting in a car
Waiting for the right time
Waiting in a car
Waiting for the right time
Waiting in a car
Waiting for the right time
Waiting in a car
Waiting for the right time
Waiting in a car
Waiting for the right time
Waiting in a car
Waiting for the right time

// Reunion //

You came out of nowhere
Stealing my heart and brain
Flaming my every cell
You make me feel myself

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Will you stand in this land?
Will you stand in this land forever?

Across the time and space
A never-ending dance
A blooming and a trance
You make me feel my soul
There's no more loneliness
Only sparkles and sweat
There's no more single fate
You make me feel myself

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Will you stand in this land?
Will you stand in this land forever?

"My body is like a lightning rod
Capsize me and douse me in your bay
A shiver of want, always
When you are on the tip of my tongue
In the back of your parked car
I could build a fort
And play all day
Between your lips and mine
Let's stay here forever"

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Will you stand in this land?
Will you stand in this land forever?

// Wait //

Send your dreams
Where nobody hides
Give your tears
To the tide
No time
No time
There's no end
There is no goodbye
Disappear
With the night
No time
No time
No time
No time
No time

// Raconte-Moi Une Histoire //

I've heard about this frog
It's very tiny frog
But it's also very special
You can only find it in the jungle
So far away from here
But if you find it
And if you touch it
Your world can change forever
If you touch its skin
You can feel your body changing
And your vision also
Blue becomes red
And red becomes blue
And your mommy suddenly becomes your daddy
And everything looks like a giant cupcake
And you keep laughing, and laughing, and laughing
Nothing is ever quite the same, really
And after you finished laughing
It's time to turn into a frog yourself
It's very funny to be a frog
You can dive into the water
And cross the rivers
And the oceans
And you can jump all the time and everywhere
Do you wanna play with me?
We could be a whole group of friends
A whole group of frogs
Jumping into the streets
Jumping into the planet
Climbing the buildings
Swimming in the lakes and in the bathtubs
We would be hundreds, thousands, millions
The biggest group of friends the world has ever seen
Jumping and laughing forever
It would be great, right?
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the skySee all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky

// Claudia Lewis //

Alone, twenty millions years from my place
A slide, on the starlight
Watch out, a new planet right on my trail!
The space, oh oh it's mine!
Oh oh!

I'm lost, in an infinite night trip
The sun, could make me blind
I wish, I could bring a girl to my ship
And fly, her hand in mine!
Oh oh!

Alone, twenty million years from my place
(Is the dream over?)
The space, oh oh it's mine!

// This Bright Flash //

I killed all the rainbows and the species

// Soon, My Friend //

I'll be yours Sunday

// My Tears Are Becoming A Sea //

I'm slowly drifting to you
The stars and the planets
Are calling me
A billion years away from you
I'm on my way
I'm on...
I'm on...

// New Map //

There's a hole in your heart, begging for adventure
Play yourself a new track, set traps for the future
On your own
Can you do it?
The unknown
Can you face it?

Shifting desire, shifting desire, shifting desire...

Rules of conformity, heavy clouds of reason
They're hiding the beauty of your free distortions
On your own
Can you do it?
The unknown
Can you face it?
With your soul, now you see it
The landscape is infinite

Shifting desire, shifting desire, shifting desire...

// OK Pal //

What do you think I feel when I, when I, take it with you?
What do you think I see when I, when I, take it with you?
Somewhere else, somewhere else, somewhere else...

What do you think I feel when I, when I'm kissing you?
Somewhere else, somewhere else, somewhere else...

"We're walking in the streets - or what's left of them
I take your hand, and the city is slowly vanishing
There's no crowd anymore, no cars, no signals
But in the middle of the road
A purple and mellow shape is floating
The shape of our mutual dream
Stay calm, hold me tight, give it a chance to take us away"

We will live, we will dream on the shadow of our world
We will live, we will dream on the shadow of our world
We will live, we will dream on the shadow of our world

// Another Wave From You //

I think I saw you there... think I saw you there

// Splendor //

What have we to show?
Barren feelings and dust for crow
We can't ever know
When it's time to go

That's the way to see the end
Glowing out along the river bend
It's not goodbye my only friend
Yesterday started over again

// Steve McQueen //

I woke up stronger than ever
Driven by big waves of fire
To run and yell all the way
Nothing can hurt me today

There's a magic inside
Just waiting to burst out
The world is a goldmine
That will melt tomorrow

I just can't recognize myself
Tears of joy run all over my face
My sensations reach the limit
Nothing can hurt me today

There's a magic inside
Just waiting to burst out
The world is a goldmine
That will melt tomorrow

Living for, living for a thrill...
Just waiting! Just waiting!
Just waiting! Just waiting!
Just waiting! Just waiting!
Just waiting! Just waiting!
Just waiting! Just waiting!

// Echoes Of Mine //

Il est tard. Je cherche mon autre chez-moi, et je prends un chemin que je ne connais pas:
Un petit sentier qui longe les usines et la ville entre-coupant par la forêt.
Je commence à peine à entrevoir la nature, lorsque tout d'un coup, la nuit tombe.
Je suis plongée dans un monde de silence, pourtant je n'ai pas peur.
Je m'endors quelques minutes, tout au plus, et quand je me réveille,
Le soleil est là et la forêt brille d'une lumière éclatante.

Je reconnais cette forêt. Ce n'est pas une forêt ordinaire, c'est une forêt de souvenirs.
Mes souvenirs. Cette rivière blanche et sonore, mon adolescence.
Ces grands arbres, les hommes que j'ai aimés. Ces oiseaux qui volent, au loin, mon père disparu.
Mes souvenirs ne sont plus des souvenirs.
Ils sont là, vivants, près de moi, ils dansent et m'enlacent, chantent et me sourient.

Je regarde mes mains. Je caresse mon visage, et j'ai 20 ans.
Et j'aime comme je n'ai jamais aimé.

[English translation:]
It's late. Looking at my other me, and I take a road I do not know:
A small path along the plants and between the city-cutting through the forest.
I just beginning to glimpse the nature, when suddenly, the night falls.
I am immersed in a world of silence, yet I am not afraid.
I fall asleep a few minutes at most, and when I wake up,
The sun is shining and the forest of dazzling light.

I recognize that forest. This is not an ordinary forest is a forest memories.
My memories. This white noise river, my adolescence.
These large trees, the men I loved. These birds flying in the distance, my father disappeared.
My memories are not memories.
They are there, alive, near me, hug me and they dance, sing and smile at me.

I look at my hands. I caress my face, and I'm 20 years old.
And I love like I've never loved.

// Outro //

I'm the king of my own land
Facing tempests of dust, I'll fight until the end
Creatures of my dreams raise up and dance with me!
Now and forever, I'm your king!
