Album: BeforeTheDawnHealsUs

// Moon Child //

They say I made the moon 
Everything was in the dark 
No memories at all 
Just a tiny freezing wind in my back 
As I was sitting there 
Singing a song they had never heard before 
Suddenly, a voice told me 
"Keep on singing, little boy 
And raise your arms in the big black sky 
Raise your arms the highest you can 
So the whole universe will glow" 

My first vision was a bush growing down the river 
And I couldn't stop crying 
Something was missing 
I realized I was in love with a voice 
I called it, again, and again 
But all I heard was the echo in the light

// Don't Save Us From The Flames //

Tina! Tina! Tina! Tina!

Out of the flames
A piece of brain in my hair
The wheels are melting
A ghost is screaming your name.

Tina! Tina!

Bleeding all around
Liquid metal through my veins
The radio's burning
A ghost is screaming your name

Tina! Tina! Tina! Tina!

// In The Cold I'm Standing //

Something is coming now...

// Farewell / Goodbye //

Kiss on the mouth
Bliss of a touch
Hand in a hand
Killing the fiend
I'll write my love on more than a
thousand weeping willows

A walk on your voice
So far, so close
A whispering child
So far, so mild
All the colors mixed up in
falls of rainbows

Tears on your neck
Holding you near
Sparkling shells
Three comet tails
Hoping for some magic
to make your heart beat next to mine

Shiny island
Blue underground
My everyday
Is fading away
I'm flying through the wind
And whistling some strange melody

Hang on to me
Getting out of my corpse
Please don't leave me
Watching you from the clouds
Melancholy
You'll join me soon my love
Feeling frozen
I'll warm you everynight
Falling asleep
I'll travel in your dreams

// Teen Angst //

How fast we burn
How fast we cry
The more we learn
The more we die

The more we learn
The more we cry
How fast we burn
How fast we die

I hear the planet crying now,
I hear the planet crying now...

// Can't Stop //

Can't stop
I can't stop, yeah
Can't stop
I can't stop, yeah [repeat till end]

// Safe //

Atomic roads, nuclear sunrise
They left me all alone
Falling stars exploding on the sea
God it's beautiful

The land and the roses slowly disappeared
Why am I so alone?
A wounded angel is smiling at me
God it's so beautiful

// Car Chase Terror //

[Mother:]
Look at my hands, I'm shaking, all my body is shaking.

[Son:]
It was only a dream, mommy.

[Mother:]
He was there... His car was parked there in the same gas station,
all dressed in green, dark green.
I couldn't move my head, but I was watching him in the mirror.
Oh, it was horrible!
His face was sort of erased, but I knew he was looking at me.
Two invisible eyes, two invisible and monstrous eyes.

[Son:]
Please stop, you're frightening me.

[Mother:]
I'm sorry, butterfly.
You shouldn't listen to mommy.
Go back to sleep.

[Son:]
I'm not tired anymore.
I just want to get away from here.

[Mother:]
Mommy needs some sleep too.
We've got a long way to go tomorrow.
Go back to sleep angel, mom is gonna keep the devil away.
Now close your eyes, everything is fine, everything is light.
Mom loves you more than any mom in the world.
See you in the morning light where the birds sings with the sun.
I love you, sweetie.

[Son:]
I love you, mum...
