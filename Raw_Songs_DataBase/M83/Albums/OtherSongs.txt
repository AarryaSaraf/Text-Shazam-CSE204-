// Holes In The Sky //

Arms to the ground
Far from the rivers
Grace in our tears
High on a fever
Somebody heal me from my pain
I'm reaching closer
My stars dive lower
Filling up lost memories

Holes in the sky
Pierced by the fire
Somebody tell me this is real

Hands to the sky, I am a dreamer
We build the hope
We are believers
Somebody free me from my chains
I'm reaching closer
My stars dive lower
Filling up my memories

Holes in the sky
Pierced by the fire
Somebody pull me from the dark

Arms to the ground
Far from the rivers
Somebody heal me from my pain

Hands to the sky (hands to the sky)
I am a dreamer (I am a dreamer)
Somebody free me from my chains (free me from my chains)

// I Need You //

Have you ever had the feeling
That we're not alone?
All the calls I've been receiving
They are not from home
Going down the dusty roads
We can't see it now

I need you

There's a reading on the wall
of the things that I have done
if I belong to leave it all
find a way to take me

See, we're not alone
Just the colors of the world

Sitting all alone

// Oblivion //

Since I was young, I knew I'd find you
But our love was a song sung by a dying swan
And in the night, you hear me calling
You hear me calling
And in your dreams you see me falling, falling

Breathe in the light
I'll stay here in the shadow
Waiting for a sign, as the tide grows
Higher, and higher, and higher

And when the nights are long
All those stars recall your goodbye, your goodbye

And in the night you'll hear me calling
You'll hear me calling
And in your dreams you'll see us falling, falling
And in the night you'll hear me calling
You'll hear me calling
And in your dreams you'll see us falling, falling

Breathe in the light and say goodbye
Breathe in the light and say goodbye

// Sister (Part 2) //

Stay away from me
Handcuffed, the memory sounds
Stay away from me
You look like there's a scary ghost

Stay away from me
Stay, stay away from me

// Thrash Me //

The shock in her eyes
Words that echo my thoughts
Your blood in my veins
A subhuman roar
Uh, trash me for my life
Beyond this world that we despise
Uh, you give me such a joy and I -
I kiss the darkest places
And you embrace me like a toy
The shock in her eyes
Rules that we do not need
Your blood on my cheek
A subhuman roar
Uh, trash me for my pleasure
Beyond this world that we despise
Uh, you give me such a joy and I -
I kiss the darkest places
And you embrace me like a toy
The shock in her eyes
Words that we do despise
Rules that we do not need
Your blood on my cheek
My blood in your veins
A subhuman roar...

// Until The Night Is Over //

I am cold
And I'm lost
I'm standing in the rain
I'm not strong
Anymore
I'm just waiting for the sun
[repeats]

I am cold
And I'm lost (I am cold)
I'm standing in the rain
(I'm standing in the rain)
I'm not strong
Anymore (and I'm lost)
I'm just waiting for the sun
(I'm just waiting for the sun)
[repeats]
