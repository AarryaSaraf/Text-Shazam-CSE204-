To which system does she belong?
Is she the girl called sunny boy?

Have you ever believed in?
I am star-struck
Cosmic adrenaline
She's young and fierce
Have you ever kissed?
And I like her
Hmm, maybe I love her

Is that the same moon we love?
Why does this girl burn?
So long ago when we were born
A timeless sun, sun
Sun, love

Have you ever believed in?
I've been star-struck
Cosmic adrenaline
She's young and fierce
Have you ever danced?
And I love her
With a tear falling

Have you ever done it?
Danger star-struck
Cosmic adrenaline
Such a radiant queen
Have you ever danced?
Hope she hits me
With a tear falling
Oh I love her

Can we just make it last?
Can we just make it last?
Can we just make it last?
