The shock in her eyes
Words that echo my thoughts
Your blood in my veins
A subhuman roar
Uh, trash me for my life
Beyond this world that we despise
Uh, you give me such a joy and I -
I kiss the darkest places
And you embrace me like a toy
The shock in her eyes
Rules that we do not need
Your blood on my cheek
A subhuman roar
Uh, trash me for my pleasure
Beyond this world that we despise
Uh, you give me such a joy and I -
I kiss the darkest places
And you embrace me like a toy
The shock in her eyes
Words that we do despise
Rules that we do not need
Your blood on my cheek
My blood in your veins
A subhuman roar...
