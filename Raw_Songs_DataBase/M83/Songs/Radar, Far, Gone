Everyone already knew your name
It's written in the clouds
It's like you talk to them in dreams
It's like you know our signs, right?

Keep looking
Stand by
Cross a blue ridge
Slow car

You don't have to show your face
We only look inside, you see
It's like you only talk in tears
It's like you know our fears, right?

Stop looking
Come by
Is it our last chance
To be friends?

Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh
