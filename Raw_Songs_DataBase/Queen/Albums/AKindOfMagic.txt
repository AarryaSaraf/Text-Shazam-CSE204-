// One Vision //

God works in mysterious ways
Mysterious ways
Ah

Hey! One man, one goal
Ha, one mission
One heart, one soul
Just one solution
One flash of light
Yeah, one god, one vision

One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Give me one vision, yeah

No wrong, no right
I'm gonna tell you
There's no black and no white
No blood, no stain
All we need is one worldwide vision

One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One race, one hope, one real decision

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-yeah, whoa-yeah, oh yeah!

I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
But a cold wind blows
And a dark rain falls
And in my heart, it shows
Look what they've done to my dream
Yeah!

One vision
So give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready! There's only one direction
One world and one nation
Yeah, one vision

No hate, no fight, just excitation
All through the night, it's a celebration

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, yeah!

One, one, one, one, one, one, one

One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision

Give me one night, yeah
Give me one hope, hey
Just give me, ah
One man, one man
One bar, one night
One day, hey, hey
Just gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme fried chicken!
(Vision, vision, vision, vision)

God works in mysterious ways

// A Kind Of Magic //

It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic

One dream, one soul
One prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be

It's a kind of magic

One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day

It's a kind of magic

The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time

It's a kind of magic

The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity

Is this a kind of magic?
(It's a kind of magic.)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done

This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies

It's a kind of magic

The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time

It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be—
Will soon be—
Will soon be done

This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done. (Done.)

Magic
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic, magic, magic, magic, magic

(Magic), ha-ha-ha-ha, it's magic

Ha-ha
Yeah, yeah
Whoo

It's a kind of magic

// One Year Of Love //

Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart

It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you
Yeah

My heart cries out to your heart
I'm lonely but you can save me
My hand reaches out for your hand
I'm cold but you light the fire in me

My lips search for your lips
I'm hungry for your touch
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender to the moment
Just surrender

And no one ever told me
That love would hurt so much
(Ooh, yes, it hurts.)
And pain is so close to pleasure
And all I can do is surrender to your love
Just surrender to your love

Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart

It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you
And all I can do is surrender

// Pain Is So Close To Pleasure //

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Everybody knows
One day we're loving each other
Then we're fighting one another
All the time

When I was young
And just getting started
And people talked to me
They sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my 'magination
And all I wanted
Was to start a new relation
So in love, but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for
Some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed
Was some love and affection

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure

Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong
And you turn out the light
But inside of your mind
You put up a fight

Where are the answers
That we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world
To be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good
Some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy
Someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love
Wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse
So let's make the best
Of the rest of our years

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life

All your life, ooh
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure

// Friends Will Be Friends //

Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped
And the children are created
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash
And leaving you with the lumber

Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike
What you need is a rest
It's not easy, love
But you got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hands
'Cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end

Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered
A letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You try to track him down
But somebody stole his number

As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life
Without him in your way
It's so easy now
'Cause you got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hands
'Cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end

It's so easy now
'Cause you got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
'Cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
'Cause right 'til the end
Friends will be friends, yeah

// Who Wants To Live Forever //

There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us?

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

Who dares to love forever
When love must die?

But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips

And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today

Who waits forever anyway?

// Gimme The Prize //

[News reporter:]
The garage is watered from the sprinklers. It also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head. The head, which at this time, has no name

[The Kurgan:] I know his name

Here I am
I'm the master of your destiny
Ha-ha

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Gimme the prize
Just gimme the prize

Give me your kings
Let me squeeze them in my hands
He-he-hey
Your puny princes
Your so-called leaders of your land:

I'll eat them whole
Before I'm done
The battle's fought
And the game is won

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Gimme the prize
Just gimme the prize, the prize

[The Kurgan:]
Now you die
I have something to say: It's better to burn out than to fade away
There can be only one

Move over! I said move over!

Hey, hey, hey, clear the way!
There's no escape from my authority

Didn't I tell you?

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Gimme the prize
Just gimme the prize

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
So, gimme the prize

[Connor MacLeod:]
There can be only one

// Princes Of The Universe //

Here we are
Born to be kings
We're the princes of the universe

Here we belong
Fighting to survive in a war with the darkest powers

And here we are
We're the princes of the universe
Here we belong
Fighting for survival
We've come to be the rulers of your world

I am immortal
I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival
No man can be my equal
Take me to the future of your world

Born to be kings
Princes of the universe
Fighting and free
Got your world in my hand
I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand
We were born to be princes of the universe

No man could understand
My power is in my own hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
People talk about you
People say you've had your day

I'm a man that will go far
Fly the moon and reach for the stars
With my sword and head held high
Got to pass the test first time

I know that people talk about me
I hear it every day
But I can prove you wrong
'Cause I'm right first time

Alright, let's go, let's go, ha, ha
Watch this man fly
Bring on the girls
Come on, come on, come on

Here we are. (Here we are!)
Born to be kings
We're the princes of the universe
Here we belong

Born to be kings
Princes of the universe
Fighting and free
Got your world in my hand
I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand
We were born to be princes of the universe
(Universe, universe, universe)
