They were born with the knowledge of the struggle to survive
They were raised, learning only ways to stay alive
Their language is the language of the bullet and the gun
If you can see them coming, baby, better run

Here come the warboys
Here come the warboys

Well they look so pretty as they march and drill
It's such a pity that they're dressed to kill
Soldiers marching two-by-two
When it all comes down, they know exactly what to do

Here come the, huh, warboys
Here come the warboys (Hmm, warboys, oh)
Warboys, your boys, politicians' toys
Warboys, our boys, make a lot of noise
Warboys, when the lightning explodes
I pray for your soul

Ow
Hup, two, three, four

Well, they look so fierce, they're gonna tear out your heart
When they get near we're gonna see what they got
Hold on to your soul, friend of mine
I'll see you in hell some other time

Here come the warboys
Here come the warboys
Here come the warboys
Here come the
War, war (Agh)
Warboys (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Talkin' 'bout warboys, warboys
Wow, wow
