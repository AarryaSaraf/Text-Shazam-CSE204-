You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candle light
There's no one but myself to blame

But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

It's late when I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late. Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
Too late. Even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late. Though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Yes, baby

Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

It's late, but it's driving me so mad
It's late. Yes, I know but don't try to tell me
That it's too late. Save our love you can't turn out the lights
So late. I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

I've been so long
You've been so long
We've been so long tryna work it out

I ain't got long
You ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

Tell me

Tryna work it out

Ooh, too late, yeah
Too late, much too late

You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply

If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

It's late, but it's time to set me free
It's late. Ooh, yes, I know but there's no way it has to be
Too late. So, let the fire take our bodies this night
So late. Let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late
Oh, it's all too late

Whoa, whoa
It's too late, c'mon
Late too late, oh, yeah
Whoa
