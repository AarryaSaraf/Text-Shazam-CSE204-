Since I've been trying to put my life in order
Older that I learned and needing, burning
Been trying to put my corners in a
Hole that's round, that can't be smooth

I have to stop and think sometimes
Let the water roll a while
Let the days go by under my feet

Let me out, let me out of the water I'm in
Let me out of the hole that's been
Let them know the rain, looking for the other way

Looking for an answer to that
Something that I love, I'm breathing
Ain't no kind of way I'll see you
I don't know love can fit this way

I have to stop and think sometimes
Let the water roll awhile
Let the days go by under my feet
