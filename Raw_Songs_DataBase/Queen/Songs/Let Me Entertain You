Hey, it's a sellout!
Hey!

Let me welcome you ladies and gentlemen
I would like to say hello
Are you ready for some entertainment?
Are you ready for a show?
Gonna rock gonna roll you
Get you dancing in the aisles
Jazz you, razzamatazz you
With a little bit of style

C'mon
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

I've come here to sell you my body
I can show you some good merchandise
I'll pull you and I'll pill you
I'll Cruella-DeVille you
And to thrill you I'll use any device
Ah, ha ha ha ha

We'll give you crazy performance
We'll give you grounds for divorce
We'll give you piece de resistance
And a tour de force of course

We found the right location
Got a lot of pretty lights
The sound and amplification listen
Hey, if you need a fix, if you want a high
Stickells'll see to that
With Elektra and EMI
We'll show you where it's at

So c'mon
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

Just take a look at the menu
We give you rock a la carte
We'll breakfast at Tiffany's
We'll sing to you in Japanese
We're only here to entertain you

If you wanna see some action
You get nothing but the best
The S and M attraction
We've got the pleasure chest
Chicago down to New Orleans
We get you on the line
If you dig the New York scene
We'll have a son-of-a-bitch-of-a-time

C'mon
Let me entertain
Let me entertain
Let me entertain you tonight

 Hey, where's my backstage pass?
 That was a bit of a riot, yeah?
 That was great, what an outrageous costume!
 Hey, that Brian May, he's outta sight, man!
 Not many, not many... no, it's true!
 Whoa, what is up with that? Funny...
 I've always wanted to be a groupie!
 Oh man, I could give less of a shit if you wanted... C'mon!
 Oh, oh!
