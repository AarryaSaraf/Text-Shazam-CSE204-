Oh, yeah
Yeah

I can't wake in the mornin'
I can't sleep at night
I got a pain in my memory
That just won't sit right
You might say I'm losin' my mind
What a shame, shame, shame
But I don't want and I don't need
To play the cryin' game
Music lights this flame in me
I won't let it go and it won't let me be
I'm just a happy slave and I, oh, I can't leave it
'Cause I'm still, and I always will be a believer

Still burnin', yeah
Still yearnin'
And the wheel's
Still turnin'
Ooh, let me tell you why
We're jivin'
And the beat's
Still drivin'
And we all
Sky divin'
Rock 'n' roll, never die

I can't breathe in the city
Got dust in my lungs
I get mad in the country
Everythin' seem to go wrong
You might think I'm playin' around
But my heart is true
I got reason to believe that sweet soul magic
Gonna tear my heart in two
Music makes the world go 'round
I've been flyin' on the wings of the sound
It feels so good from way up here
I'm still a believer, headin' for the stars

Oh, yeah
I'm still burnin'
Still yearnin'
Still burnin'
Still yearnin'
Still turnin'
Better than every guy
We're jivin'
Still drivin'
Sky divin'
Rock 'n' roll, never die

Don't say that you love me
I can't go that road
But don't think for a moment
That my heart went cold
I keep thinkin' about what I lost
And what I might have found
I went to sleep, and when I woke
Everythin' had turned around

Still burnin', yeah
Still yearnin'
Still turnin'
A new day dawnin'
We're jivin'
Still drivin'
Sky divin'
Early in the mornin'
Still burnin', yeah
Still yearnin'
And the wheel's
Still turnin'
Better than every guy
We're jivin'
And the beat's
Still drivin'
And we're all
Sky divin'
Rock 'n' roll, never die
