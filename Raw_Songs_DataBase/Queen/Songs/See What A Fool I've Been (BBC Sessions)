Well, she's gone, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh, Lord
I said, "What a fool I've been."

Caught a train
A train to Georgia
Sixteen-coaches long
Oh Lord, I said
"Sixteen-coaches long. Yeah."
Wow

I walked out
Onto the highway
Ooh, ow, ow, ow, ow
Oh Lord, I said
"Greyhound bus had gone."
Wow, surprise to me
Now hear this

I walked out onto the highway
Greyhound bus had gone
Oh, Lord
I said, "Greyhound bus had gone."
It went a long time ago, sure did
Wow

Oh, well she's gone
Gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
So long
I said, "What a fool I've been, ooh."
Ah
