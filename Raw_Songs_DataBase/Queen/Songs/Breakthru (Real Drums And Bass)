I wake up
I feel fine
Your face
Chills my spine
Honey, you're touching something deep inside of me
Honey, you're touching something, you're touchin' me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see?

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Oh, I love it, love that one

Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
But everybody knows your looks at me
Honey, you're sparking something deep inside of me
A flame that's burning brightly, it's taking over me
I'm outta control, outta my head, can't you see, baby?

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru

Breakthru, these barriers of pain
Breakthru, yeah, to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru
Breakthru, breakthru, breakthru

Ha
Somebody else is up first
Somebody else is up first

Growing up (Who says that?)
It's hard for you (Tell me about it)
Everybody tells you so
But you oughta know
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Maybe you're breathing in somebody else's air
Maybe you're trapped in somebody else's sordid life affair

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru

It could be a breakthru
It could be a breakthru
Hey, yes sir
It could be a breakthru
Breakthru, breakthru
Ah, ah, I love it
