I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Ooh, but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you

Yeah, I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road
To get a hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying, "Baby, it's all right."
When deep inside
You're really petrified
Lover turns to hater on this escalator

I can't live with you
Yeah, but I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you

We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves

Hold on, baby, tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doing what we gotta do, yeah
I can't live with you
I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But, baby, I'll never ever leave you

I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
'Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh, and everything about you
I can't live with you
No, I just can't live, I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah, and I can't live without you
Through the madness
Through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years, yeah!

Ooh, yeah
Yeah, I can't live
Without you, yeah, yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Oh, I can't live without you
Baby, baby, baby
Without you, whoa yeah
I can't live without you
