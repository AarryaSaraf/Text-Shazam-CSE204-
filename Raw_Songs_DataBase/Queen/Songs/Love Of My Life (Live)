Are you in the mood for um, singing?
Give us a little help with this. This is "Love Of My Life"
You remember this?

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You don't know it
It's alright

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've stolen my love, you now desert me

Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)
I still love you
I still love you love you love you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh hurry back, hurry back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, yeah

Thank you
