The harder we play, the faster we fall
When we think that we know it all, we know nothing at all
The letter arrives like a bolt from the blue
So what's left of your lives, all your dreams lost to you

Say it ain't true, say it today
When I open my eyes, will it all go away?
Say it's not true, say it's not real
Can't be happenin' to you, can't be happenin' to me

It's hard not to cry, it's hard to believe
So much heartache and pain, so much reason to grieve
With the wonders of science, all the knowledge we've stored
Magic cocktails for lives people just can't afford

Say it's not true, you can say it's not right
It's so hard to believe the size of the crime
Say it's not true, you can say it's not right
It's so hard to believe the size of the crime
Say
Say it's not real, ooh
Could be happenin' to you
Say it's not true, you can say it's not right
It's hard to believe the size of the crime
Say it's not true, say it's not real
Could be happening to you, it could be happening to me
