Hey girl, he treats you bad
Leaves you at home on your own while he roams
Said he was out with the boys
Smells like sweet perfume
Lipsticks on his collar
His pockets ain't got a dollar
He staggers and he falls asleep
In the same clothes that he wore in the street
Wakes up and demands to eat
You're in this thing mighty deep

What you need is a change of heart
What you need is a change of life
I know you got to have a change of man, change to me
What you need is a change of heart
What you need is a change of life
In fact I know you need a change of man, change to me

Every Saturday night he wants to start a fight with you
Either she ain't treatin' him right
Or just because he's high as a kite
He blames you because the sun didn't shine
And he blames you for what's wrong with his mind
He uses you as a scapegoat
If you can't see it
Let me pull your coat
He uses reverse psychology on you
Remember when you caught him with Nona
Didn't he accuse you of being with some creep?
Girl you're in this thing mighty deep

What you need is a change of heart
In fact I know you need a change of life
What you need is a change of man, change to me
What you need is a change of heart
Change of life
Change of man, change to me

Start me think about it he never says he loves you
And I don't think he do, do you?
I think he only thinks of you as he would an old worn out shoe

Change to me, think about it baby!
Change to me!

Change of heart
What you need is a change of life
In fact I know you need a change your man, change to me
In fact I know you need a change of heart
You really  change of life
What you need is a change of man, change to me

Change of heart... change of life... change of man... change to me...
