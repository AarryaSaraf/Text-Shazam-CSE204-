Light up of reflections
Glowing warming your completion
Must I be reminded oh so constantly
You mean everything to me
How will I forget you (baby baby)
Tell me baby (how will I forget you)
How will I forget you (baby baby)

With the pale moon high above me
And your warm eyes saying you love me
A million moonbeams can't erase the visions of your lovely face
How will I forget you (baby baby)
Tell me baby (how will I forget you)
How will I forget you (baby baby)
Baby baby

Oh, when I met you baby, I thought I would be free
I never stopped to realize, you're a part of me, girl
With the pale moon high above me
And your warm eyes telling me you love me
A million moonbeams can't erase the visions of your lovely face
How will I forget you (baby baby)
Tell me that you love me (how will I forget you)
Will I ever forget you (baby baby)
Oh baby

When I left you baby, I thought I would be free
I never stopped to realize, you're a part of me
You know you are
With the pale moon high above me
And no body here to love me

Must I be reminded, oh so constantly
Hey you mean everything to me (baby baby)
Ah-ha-ha-ha yeah (how will I forget you)
I don't want to look at you baby (baby baby)
But how can I help myself (how will I forget you)
Baby baby (baby baby)
How am I ever gonna forget you (how will I forget you)
How will I forget you (baby baby)
Tell me can I forget you (how will I forget you)
