When your in arms, darling
When your in my arms

That feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You shake me, break me
Everytime your lips meet mine
I feel a pounding, pounding
Oh I can't stand it, stand it

When you lock me in, your embrace
And breathlessly, you kiss my face
I get a strange sensation
Oh I can't stand it, stand it

Oh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You take control,
Of my very soul,
Everytime your close to me
You make me quiver and shake
Oh I can't stand it, stand it

I touch your lips, your fingertips
I get a loving reaction, soul satisfaction
Darling, you know that
I can't stand it, stand it

Feeling, feeling
And it's got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You're earthquakin', soul shakin'
Ever lovin', breath takin'
You're electrifying, oh
Soul satisfying

When you walk, in a room
Right away I start to swoon
I'm not sure of what you got,
But what it is, I like alot

Oh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

Shake me, break me
Everytime your lips meet mine
I feel a pounding, pounding
Oh I can't stand it, stand it

Oh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough
