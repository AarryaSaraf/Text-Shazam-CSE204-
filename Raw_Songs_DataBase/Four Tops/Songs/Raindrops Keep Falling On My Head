Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
And just like the guy who's feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'

So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they sent to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me, 'cause
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me, 'cause
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me
