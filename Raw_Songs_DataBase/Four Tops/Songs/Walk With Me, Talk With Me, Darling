Come on and walk with me
Oh baby, talk to me
Come on and show me
That you love me for eternity
Come on and say you care
Tell me you'll stay right here
And we'll have happiness
The way that it's supposed to be

Oh, love feels good
So you want it to stay with you
You look to me for the way
Some search forever before it's found
But this is my way, girl, to keep love around

Come on and walk with me
Oh baby, talk to me
Come on and show me
That you love me for eternity
Come on and say you care
Tell me you'll stay right here
And we'll have happiness
The way that it's supposed to be

Oh, now love is a chance
Everybody has to take
Although it might end in pain
Forget the future, girl
Just love today
Hey, let's be together
We're gonna make it all the way

Come on and walk with me
Oh baby, talk to me
Come on and show me
That you love me for eternity
Come on and say you care
Tell me you'll stay right here
And we'll have happiness
The way that it's supposed to be

(Come on and walk with me)
Come on and walk with me
(Come on and talk to me)
Talk to me, baby

Hold on to my heart
And put all your faith in me
Together we'll weather the storm
Be cool in sunshine
Stay dry in the rain
If something hurts us, girl, we'll never feel the pain

Come on and walk with me
Oh baby, talk to me
Come on and show me
That you love me for eternity
Come on and say you care
Tell me you'll stay right here
And we'll have happiness
The way that it's supposed to be

Come on and walk with me
Oh baby, talk to me
Come on and show me
That you love me for eternity
Come on and say you care
Tell me you'll stay right here
