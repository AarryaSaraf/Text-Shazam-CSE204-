You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it

From the day that I learned your name
Everything's been re-arranged
You came into my life like no one ever can, ooh my, my
Now you say the feelings have changed
That you've been hurt and loved once
And you don't want to be hurt and loved again

But how could you put a hold on your heart
That's when the hurt starts
That's when the hurt starts, my, my

You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it

Why should I be judge by his mistakes?
Especially when there're so much state, baby
Your heart, my heart falls apart
Oh, baby, baby, baby, that's when the hurt starts
That's when the hurt starts, my, my

Breaking up is such a hard thing to do
When you know you've got love that's still true
It's not fair to me, it's not fair to you
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, think it through
I want you to think it through, baby
I want you to think it through, baby

You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it

You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it

You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
