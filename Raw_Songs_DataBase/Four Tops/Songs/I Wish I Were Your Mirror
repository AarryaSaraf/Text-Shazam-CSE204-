I'll make sure you see me everyday, oh yeah
And though you smile at me, a quick hello is all you ever said
(I wish I were your mirrow now)
So you would stare at me
(I wish I were your sweater now)
At least you'd wear me

'Cause when you look at me
I know I don't exist
But everytime I look at you
I can almost feel your lovin' kiss
I wish I were your pillow (Wish I were your pillow)
You rest your head upon
I wish I were the big, big beat of your very (Wish I were your heartbeat)
You need to rely upon
There's no name, no word
Good enough I guess (Good enough) (Good enough)
An angel's strength in heaven
Baby that's the best I can express

(I wish that I were your mirrow now)
Whoo!
(I wish that I were your mirrow now)
Don't you know that I do?

Just because I want you, I can't make you want me
Just because I want you, I cannot make a flower turn into a tree

(How I wish I were your only)
Yeah baby I do
(Though you don't think about it all)
You write it, you smell it, you turn around whenever and it's gone!

I wish I were your water girl
That you take your shower in
I wish I were the sweet, sweet, sweet Camay
I always smell beneath your lovely, lovely skin
I wish I were your mirror (Wish I were your mirror)
You'd carry everywhere (Wish I were your mirror)
How I wish I were your mirror
You'd handle me with so much love and care
I wish that I were your mirror
