And I'll never change (oh, no)
Never stop loving you
Tears fall like rain (tears fall like rain, like rain I'll never stop)
I'll never stop loving you (never stop loving you)

I still get that same old feeling inside of me
Time ain't the healing thing like it's supposed to be
The leaves will fall outside, come again in the springtime

And I'll never change (oh, no)
Never stop loving you
Tears fall like rain (tears fall like rain, like rain I'll never stop)
I'll never stop loving you (never stop loving you)

In time, the water change the rocks to sand
In time, a boy will grow up into a man
Highways will rise up from the dust, a city won't feel us

And I'll never change (oh, no)
Never stop loving you
Tears fall like rain (tears fall like rain, like rain I'll never stop)
I'll never stop loving you (never stop loving you)

You'll love with me for eternity
The pain of loving you has left its mark
(Can't stop, can't stop loving you again)
And still I find myself rushing to your heart
(Can't stop, can't stop loving you again)
I'm like a ship whose anchor fell to the bottom of love

And I'll never change (oh, no)
Never stop loving you
Tears fall like rain (tears fall like rain, like rain and I'll never stop)
I'll never stop loving you (never stop loving you)
And I'll never change, no baby (oh, no)
I'll never stop loving you
I'll never change
No I'll never stop loving you
I won't change
