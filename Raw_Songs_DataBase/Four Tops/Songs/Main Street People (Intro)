We've made some progress, this I know
Look around you'll see it show
Men on the moon and watching it on TV

We move ahead at breakneck speed
There ain't no end to the things we need
All for the betterment of you and me

But if someone should ask, "Would it be too great a task
To see the world the way it used to be?"
Whatever happened to the days we met on Main Street?
All we ever wanted to do was sing and dance
Maybe we could go back again and look for Main Street

But sad as it may be, people we never get the chance

Whatever happened to the days we met on Main Street?
