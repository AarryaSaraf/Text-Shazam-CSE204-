Darling, you say you're lonely, well, I'm lonely too
But togetherness is the answer for me and you
Now I know, since he left you haven't been the same
And memories are all that remain

But darling, call on me, call on me, call on me, call on me
If you ever need that someone, call on me

And you've been so misunderstood
And you haven't known love as you should
Now I don't, see I don't know fancy words to say
But I do know how to love you all the way

So darling, if you want me
If you ever need someone, call on me
Darling, if you need me and if you want me
If you ever need someone, call on me
Oh call me, call me
If you ever need someone, call on me
Call on, call on, call on, yeah
If you need me, call on me
Darling, call on me, call on me
