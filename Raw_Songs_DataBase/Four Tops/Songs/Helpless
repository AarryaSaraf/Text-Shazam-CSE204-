Every day I walk some lonely street
Searchin' 'til you come back to me
People around just stop and stare
As if they know the hurt I bear
And suddenly I realize

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Since you've been gone I've been cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

Without a word without a warning
You left my life on early morning
Did I lean on you a little too strong
Too much of you I depended on
All at once I'm alone

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Since you've been gone I've been cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In the shelter of your love my strength I found
But now I'm useless, darlin', since you're not around
I'm helpless baby

"Need some consolation, I need it, need it"...

Baby baby I'm helpless since I lost your love
Helpless 'cause now I need your love
I need your words of confidence (need it, need it)
I need those happy times we spent
Since you've been gone

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
All at once it hit me, I'm alone I'm alone

Oh helpless
Since I lost your love
Helpless
'Cause now I need your love
I never needed no one before
But now I need you more and more
I'm helpless 'til you come back to me
Helpless...
