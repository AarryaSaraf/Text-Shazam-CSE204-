You didn't know I saw you there
But I can name you the street and the dress that you were wearing
The other guy kinda looked like me
But will he touch you good and so sincerely?
I hated him for being with you
I felt bad, afraid for what I might do

Right before my eyes
My future died, love died
Right before my eyes
It turned to dirt, my pride was hurt, yeah

I heard his name rumored once before
But you innocently smiled, and reassured me
Just cruising around, had nothing to do
Now, the shock I got seeing him holding you
If someone had told me, I never would've believed
But my own two eyes, they don't deceive me

Right before my eyes
Oh, my heart was touched, my dream was crushed
Girl, right before my eyes
It turned to dirt, my pride was hurt

You are the reason our future died, love died
Right before my eyes (Right before my eyes)
It turned to dirt, my pride was hurt
Right before my eyes
My heart was touched, my dream was crushed
Ooh, you are the reason (Right before my eyes)
It turned to dirt, my pride was hurt
Hey, right before my eyes
It turned to dirt, my pride was hurt
Ooh, oh yeah (Right before my eyes)
