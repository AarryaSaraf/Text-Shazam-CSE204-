He asked a question, you had no answer
The music finds you a sad and lonely dancer
Somehow you've lost it, what everybody's looking for
But yesterday's dead and gone, tomorrow's at your door

Better put a little love away
Everybody needs a penny for a rainy day
So put a little love away

Keep another thought in mind
Someone's gotta leave, somebody's gotta stay behind
So put a little love away

Two people sharing one tear too many
Look around for miracles, you know they don't find any
I've seen it coming but what am I supposed to do?
Just take a closer look around and simply say to you

Better put a little love away
Everybody needs a penny for a rainy day
So put a little love away

Keep another thought in mind
Someone's gotta leave, somebody's gotta stay behind
So put a little love away

Put a little love away
Everybody needs a penny for a rainy day
Put a little love away

Keep another thought in mind
Someone's gotta leave, somebody's gotta stay behind
Put a little love away

Put a little love away
Everybody needs
