(Don't bring back your memories)
Can't you let the past, let it remain in the past
Don't bring back memories, baby
For the love, doubt that couldn't lie

In each heart, there's tale of woe
For the love affair that fell through
But we must find that inner strength
That one needs to start anew
It's with my deepest regret
Baby I must forget we ever met
I've got some nights yet to live
Baby, I've got a lot of love left to give
I've got to find somebody new
Who'll appreciate the things I tried to do for you
Now those people, right by my side girl
Baby, protect her, always be her guide now

Don't you bring me those worn out memories, girl, now
Don't you bring me those obsolete memories
No no no no, my heart can't stand it
Oh, no no no no no no no no

I don't need those memories, girl
Baby, now don't you do it
My heart can't take it
Girl, oh I feel faint
It's gonna ruin my shape
Feelin' heartaches I feel with the stake
But this, I would much, much rather do
Than take another chance, chance with you
It's been my deepest regret
Baby, I just got to forget we met
I've still got some life to live
Girl, you know I got a lot of love left to give
I'm gonna find somebody new, yeah girl
That will appreciate the things I try to do
Yeah, I'm gonna keep her right by my side
Always protect her, be my only guide now

It's so hard can't take it
Antiquated memories
Rustin' memories, I don't need them
Nor do I want them
