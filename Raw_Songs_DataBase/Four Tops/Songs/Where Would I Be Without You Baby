What if you should come to me
One day and say you found somebody new
I know that might sounds strange, 
But I hate to be alone
And the more I think about it, 
The more desperate I become

Lonely, lonely me
I don't have any idea
As to where I would be or what I do without you, baby
Ooh, why would it be so easy
That there'll be no rhyme or reason for living
If you should say we're through

When I look into your eyes
Sometimes you turn away from me
Oh, in the moment of closeness
My heart starts beating fast
But with him, it's not the same
I don't think it's gonna last

Lonely, lonely me
I don't have any idea
As to where I would be without you
Oh-oh-oh, why would it be so easy
That there'll be no rhyme or reason for living
If you should say we're through
Oh, tell me
Somebody tell me if it's a silly premonition
(Premonition)
Hey, that I got condemned from loving a girl like you
Oh, hey, hey
Don't put out the fire that burns
Can't you see how much my heart would yearn?

Lonely, lonely me
I don't have any idea
As to where I would be or what I do without you, baby
Hey, hey, hey! 
Why would it be so easy
That there'll be no rhyme or reason for living
If you should say we're through (oh-oh-oh)
If you should say we're through
If you should say we're through (say we're through)
If you should say we're through

Lonely, lonely me
I don't have any idea
As to where I would be or what I do without you, baby
Hey, why would it be so easy
That there'll be no rhyme or reason for living
If you should say we're through
If you should say we're through
If you should say we're through (say we're through)
If you should say we're through

Hey, hey lonely, lonely me
I don't have any idea
As to where I would be or what I do without you, baby
Hey, why would it be so easy
That there'll be no rhyme or reason for living
If you should say we're through
If you should say we're through
