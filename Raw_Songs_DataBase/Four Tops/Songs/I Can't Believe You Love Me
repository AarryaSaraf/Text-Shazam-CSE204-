Oh, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe you love me
Oh no, no, no I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me anymore (anymore)
Not like before (not like before)

You don't kiss me like you used to
You don't say those pretty, pretty words
There's no thrill in your kiss
There's no sincerity
Oh, I do believe you've gotten over me

I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe that you love me 
I can't believe that you love me anymore (anymore)
Not like before (not like before)

Girl, whenever we're together
Not one word, honey, did you say
Oh, when I speak your name 
In the sweetest, sweetest tone, hey, hey, hey
It makes me feel like I'm standing all alone

I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe that you love me 
I can't believe that you love me anymore (anymore)
Not like before (not like before)

I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me anymore (anymore)
Not like before (not like before)

You better change your ways of loving
If ought to know if you really, really care
You better show or concern
Pay more attention to me, girl (say it again, yeah)
Or otherwise I'm gonna be forced to leave you

I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe that you love me 
I can't believe that you love me anymore (anymore)
Not like before (not like before)
