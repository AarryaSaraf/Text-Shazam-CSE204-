Quiet nights 'n quiet stars
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go
To watch the world below together

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie
Away from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie
Away from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew
Became these quiet nights of loving you!
