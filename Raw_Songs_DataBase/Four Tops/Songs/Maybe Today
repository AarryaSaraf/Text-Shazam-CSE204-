Maybe today
They'll be sunshine
Where the rain
On my side of town
Mayer for a change
The gods will rearrange
Perhaps they'll find the love to send out
And maybe today
On the rising
A surprising new face
Will appear
Maybe she'll be mine
And if if the both of us are lonely
She'll say your hearts found it's way
Maybe it might be today
