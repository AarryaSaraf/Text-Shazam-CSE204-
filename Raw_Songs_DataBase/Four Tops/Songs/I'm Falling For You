I'm falling for you
I'll never be blue
What can I say and what can I do?
Little girl I'm falling for you

My friends all declare
That your love isn't fair
Why would you say
That you really don't care?
Darling I'm falling for you

Although I'm not a fool dear
But if there should come a time
There's only one thing I'll ever ask
Is the maker to make you mine

'Cause you're tops in my world
And I love this affair, no I'm not a clown
My love is just down
Little darling I'm falling for you

You're tops in my world
And I love this affair
Why would you say
That you really don't care?

When you know darn well
I'm falling for you
Yeah baby, little darling
Sugar, peach, plum, honey
I'm falling for you

So watch your step
I've set my traps to get you
Watch your step
I'll get you yet, I'll bet you

Sugar, peach, plum, darling
You know I'm falling for you, yeah
