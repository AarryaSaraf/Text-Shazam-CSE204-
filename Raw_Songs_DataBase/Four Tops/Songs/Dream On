Ooh, girl, ooh, girl

Don't be discouraged, now that it's over
'Cause nothing's as bad as it seems
Though you maybe crying tonight
Everything will be alright if you hold on to your dream

Take it from me, girl, I've been heartbroken
And I know the pain you must be in
Your world maybe falling apart but listen to your heart
It won't be long until tears start falling and love starts calling

Dream on, dream on
'Cause it's dreaming that makes dreams come true
If only you can dream on, dream on
Darling, you can find someone new, yes, you can

You'll find a new love, one that is true love
So open your heart and let it sing, girl
There's so much love left to find so just leave the past behind
I know the future will bring you sunshine but in the mean time

Dream on, dream on
'Cause it's dreaming that makes dreams come true
If only you can dream on, dream on
Baby, you can find someone new
Dream on, dream on
Baby, you can find someone new

Now close your eyes and dream of paradise
Dream of sunny days and tender moon midnight
Don't let disappointment close the door
Just let you imagination soar

And dream on, dream on
'Cause it's dreaming that makes dreams come true
If only you can dream on, dream on
Darling, you can find someone, you can find someone

Dream on, dream on
Dreaming that makes dreams come true
If only you can dream, girl
Keep dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, girl
Baby, all your dreams will come true
Oh, keep dreaming, girl, dreaming, girl
