Hey, I know it's a modern world
And things are really different today
Every girl's got to have her freedom
Well, it's supposed to be that way

All I know is everything that I feel
Let me know, is it real?

Now I'm not trying to tie you down
I'm not against a little fun
I just got to be your only man
'Cause to me you are the only one

All I want is someone who will hold my hand
All I need is someone who will understand

Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
That's all I want to know
Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
If you are, let it show
Are you with me, are you with me girl?

Now some guys like to dance every dance
And some guys only dance fast
Well, I don't care about dancin' at all
As long as I can have the last

From now on I'm just gonna sing my song
And if you want, baby, you can sing along

Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
That's all I want to know
Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
If you are, let it show
Are you with me, are you with me girl?

From now on, I'm just gonna sing my song
And if you want, baby, you can sing along

Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
That's all I want to know
Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
If you are, let it show
Are you with me, are you with me girl?

Baby, (Are you with me?)
Baby, honey, darlin'
This old heart of mine
(Are you with me?)
Been broke a thousand times
(Are you with me girl?)
Yes it has girl

All I want is someone to
(Are you with me?)
Hold my hand
I just need someone who will understand
My...
(Are you with me?)
(Are you with me girl?)

Just take our love
(Are you with me?)
Just take our love
To your hideaway
(Are you with me?)
(Are you with me girl?)
