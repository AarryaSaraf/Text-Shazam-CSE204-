Darling, I really wanna know
Am I in your plan?
Can I be your man?

Darling, I'll never leave your side
If you'd be my blushing bride
I just wanna be your man
Please

All my love
I promise you all my love
All the love I can give
As long as we both shall live
I'll give you all the soul
I know that your heart can hold

Love that I feel inside for you
It's true

I'd walk through burning sand
Sail the ship on dry land
If I could be your man

I, I promise to be true
I'll be real good to you
I wanna be your man
Please, yeah

All my love
I promise you all my love
All the love I can give
As long as we both shall live
I'll give you all the soul
I know that your heart can hold

The love I feel inside for you
Oh, it's true

Darling, I'd walk through burning sand
Sail the ship on dry land
All I wanna do is just be your man
Please, please, oh yeah

All my love
I promise you all my love
All the love I can give
As long as we both shall live
I'll give you all the soul
I know that your heart can hold

All the love I can give
As long as we both shall live
