If you think you're all alone in the world
Carrying a heavy load
You wanted to search (You wanted to search)
Your heart to know (Your heart to know)
That you got someone right down the road

Just knock on my door
Knock on my door
Knock on my door
And I'll be standing there

If you're feeling pain and you're feeling shame
And you have nowhere to go
Don't despair, baby (Don't despair, baby)
I'll be there, baby (I'll be there, baby)
To solve them every blow

All you gotta do is knock on my door
Knock on my door
Knock on my door
And I'll be standing there

Pull aside your foolish pride
Hold your head up high
'Cause you've got someone on your side
That all the money in the world can't buy

Oh, just to know that there is someone else
Who will understand and care
We'll give you strength, baby, to carry on
And solve the problems that we share

Oh, just knock on my door
Knock on my door
Knock on my door
And I'll be standing there

(I'll be standing there)
You know I'll be there, baby
Knock, I'll be standing there
I'll be there, baby
Knock, I'll be standing there
All you gotta do is knock, I'll be standing there
