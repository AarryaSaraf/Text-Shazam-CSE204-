She comes to me, when my spirit's low
She sticks right on em down plan to get up and go
Even when my attitude is negative as can be
Oh, she's so positive, that is starts changing me

She's an understanding woman, oh...
She knows how to give and take, and we all know that that makes
Her an understanding woman (she's right on time)
Ah, she's my cutie pie and I'm gonna love her till the day I die

She's right on time, every step of the way
So full of laughter, so full of play
And every time she sees a bit of gloom coming on
One kiss after another (until all the gloom is gone)

Oh, she's an understanding woman
Well, come make up very simple, with a cute little nose and a dimple
She's an understanding woman (she's right on time)
Ah, sweet little gift from the lord above
She's kind of born to be full of love

Oh, how can I lose with her by my side
She's my rabbits foot, my lucky charm
Scares off the blues like a scarecrow in a field of corn
I can feel her strange magic, when I'm holding her, in my arms

Oh, she's an understanding woman, oh...
She knows how to give and take, and we all know that that makes
My baby an understanding woman (she's right on time)
Ooh, yes she is not, yes she is not
My baby an understanding woman, ahh-ha
She's right on time
