I promise I'll try not to cry
I'll brush away the tears
And just might keep you here
Though I love you so
Somehow I know that you were meant to go

You're finally getting your freedom now
There's nothing in your way
It's time to end all the good times that we had
I've got to go (I've got to go)

I promise I'll try not to cry
(Ain't no stopping me now)
I'll brush away the tears
And just might keep you here
Though I love you so
Somehow I know that you were meant to go

I'm sure you're gonna find someone else
That won't be hard for you
Why don't you fret about what becomes of me
Don't you know I've got to go (I've got to go)

I promise I'll try not to cry
(Ain't no stopping me now)
I'll brush away the tears
And just might keep you here
Though I love you so
Somehow I know that you were meant to go

I was foolish to fall in love
You were just passing through
I guess there's not much more for us to say
Don't you know I've got to go (I've got to go)

I'll promise I'll try not to cry
(Ain't no stopping me now)
I'll brush away the tears
And just might keep you here
Though I love you so
Somehow I know that you were meant to go

I'll promise I'll try not to cry
(Ain't no stopping me now)
