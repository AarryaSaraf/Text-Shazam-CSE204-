Here I go again
I hear your footsteps running up and down my brain
And in my darkest hour
I see your face

If I, can see you
Why can't I be with you?
I know the mountain's high
We can climb it if we try, try, try

And happy is a bumpy road
We can make it, I know
And happy is a bumpy road
We can make it

We're like children holding hands
And if you slip, you know that I will help you stand
'Cause in my solitude
You gave me hope

So if I, can see you
Why can't I be with you?
I know the struggle's great
But buried arms we can break, I know

Happy is a bumpy road
We can make it, girl I know
Happy is a bumpy road
We can make it, if we try

Yeah
If I can see you (Why can't I be with you?)
Why can't I be with you?
Baby, I know the mountain's so high
But we can climb it if we try, try, try

Happy is a bumpy road
I know we can make it
(Happy is a bumpy road)
We just have to try
Happy is a bumpy road
(Happy is a bumpy road)
