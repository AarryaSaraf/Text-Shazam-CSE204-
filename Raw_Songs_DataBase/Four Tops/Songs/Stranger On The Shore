Here I stand
Watching the tide go
So all alone and blue
Just dreamin' the dreams of you

I watched your ship
I watched your ship
As it sailed out to sea
Taking all of my dreams, dear
And taking all of me, yeah

The sighing of the waves
The wailing of the wind
To you my dear I love you
Oh, where do I begin?

Oh why, oh why, oh why must I
Must I go on like this?
Must I just be alone here
A stranger on the shore?

The sighing of the waves
The wailing of the wind
To you my dear I love you
Oh, where do I begin?

Oh why, oh why, oh why must I, yeah
Must I go on like this?
Must I just be alone here
Till my love returns
Must I go on like this?
All alone and feeling blue, yeah

I watched your ship
As it sailed out
Oh why, oh why
Oh why, oh why
Why, oh why, oh why
My, oh my, oh my
Stranger on the shore
