A few words, said in anger
Have put my lonely heart in danger
One mistake, made you part
But when you left, you took my heart

I now sit quietly in a room
Hoping you'll return real soon

Where did you go?
Where did you go?

Only your warm embrace
Can fill this empty place

I look up and down each lonely street
Hoping one day soon we'll meet
Searching here, searching there
Looking for you, everywhere

Your love it means the most to me
I need you close to me

Where did you go girl?
Where did you go?

Only your warm embrace
Can fill this empty place

I pass the house you used to stay
It's lonely and vacant, I'm the same old way
When our friends mention your name
The hurt, comes back again

No matter what I try to do
I can't get over losing you

Where did you go?
Where did you go?

I've been searching for you everywhere
Where did you go?
Where?
