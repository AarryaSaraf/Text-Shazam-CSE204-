Better wait a minute. 
Ya better hold the phone. 
Ya better mind your manners. 
Better change your tone. 

Don't you threaten me son. 
You got a lot of gall. 
We gonna do things my way. 
Or we won't do things at all. 

Ya don't know what you're messin' with. 
You got no idea. 
Ya don't know what you're lookin' at 
When you're lookin' here. 

Ya don't know what you're up against, 
No, no way, no how. 
You don't know what you're messin' with, 
But I'm gonna tell you now! 

Get this straight! 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
and I'm bad. 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
and it looks like you been had. 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space, 
So get off my back, 'n get out my face, 
'Cause I'm mean and green 
And I am bad. 

Wanna save your skin boy? 
You wanna save your hide? 
You wanna see tomorrow? (Ha-Ha!) 
You better step aside. 
Better take a tip boy. 
Want some good advice? 
Ya better take it easy, 
'Cause you're walkin' on thin ice. 

Ya don't know what you're dealin' with. 
No, you never did. 
Ya don't know what you're lookin' at, 
But that's tough titty, kid! 

The Lion don't sleep tonight, 
And if you pull his tail, he roars. 
Ya say, "That ain't fair?" 
Ya say, "That ain't nice?" 
Ya know what I say? "Up yours!" 

Watch me now! 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
And I'm bad. 
I'm just a mean green mother, a real disgrace, 
And you've got me fightin' mad. 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space, 
Gonna trash your ass! Gonna rock this place! 
I'm mean and green, 
And I am bad. 

Don't talk to me about old King-Kong. 
You think he's the worst? Well, you're thinkin' wrong. 
Don't talk to me about Frankenstein. 
He got a temper? -HA!- He ain't got mine. 

You know I don't come from no black lagoon. 
I'm from past the stars and beyond the moon. 
You can keep the thing, 
Keep the it, 
Keep the creature, they don't mean shit! 

I got garden style, major moves. 
I got the stuff, and I think that proves, 
You better move it out! Nature calls! 
You got the point? I'm gonna bust your balls! 

Here it comes! 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
And I'm bad. 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
A real hard case. You can't beat this trouble, man. 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
So just give it up. It's all over, ace. 
I'm mean and green. 
(Mean green mother from outer space.) 
I'm mean and green. 
(Mean green mother from outer space.) 
I'm mean and green. 
(Mean green mother from outer space.) 
And I...am...bad!
