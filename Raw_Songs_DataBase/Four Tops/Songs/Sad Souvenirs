One love letter filled to the brim
With your heartless lies
One tired old worn out handkerchief
I used to dry my weeping eyes

These things are all I have left
Of a love I built my world around
And they're sad, sad, sad
Sad souvenirs
Sad souvenirs

One tired old empty dream
That will never ever ever come true
One battered, broken heart
Misused by you
These things are all that I own
These things alone are sad, sad, sad
Sad souvenirs
Sad souvenirs
Sad, sad, sad
Sad souvenirs
Sad souvenirs

One thousand lonely, lonely nights
One thousand tears I shed in vain
One thousand little silent prayers
To have your love again
These things are all I have left to look forward to
Darling since I lost you
They're sad, sad, sad
Sad souvenirs
Sad souvenirs

One love letter filled with lies
A worn out handkerchief to dry my eyes
Lonely nights, empty empty tears
Sad, sad, sad souvenirs
