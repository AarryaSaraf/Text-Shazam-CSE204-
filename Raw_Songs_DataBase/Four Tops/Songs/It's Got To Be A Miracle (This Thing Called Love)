All it takes is 2 hearts that care
Sprinkle just a little tenderness there
& like the tiny grains of sand that build a mountain so high
Each tender moment builds love between a girl & guy

It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
Take a boy like you & a girl like me
2 lonely people we used to be
We shared a little time, tears & laughter
It seems that we will be happy ever after

All it takes is 2 arms that know
They gotta hold you, baby, & never let go
Throw in a lover's quarrel & it's sealed with a kiss
We know that heaven must be like this

It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
I used to wander, I used to roam
Like a ship in a stormin' sea, tryin' to get home
When we found each other, heaven found a way
'Cause you were the dawn of a bright sunny day

All it takes is just a little time
3 little words, baby, that mean "Will you will be mine?"
Add a few tears 2 lovers will shed
& every sweet word that's ever been said

It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
Take a girl like me & a boy like you
Long lonely hours we once knew
We have each other & live what life's worth
All love is strong enough to move heaven & earth

It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
