Album: LostAndFoundBreakingThrough

// On The Street Where You Live //

I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once, am I several stories high?
No, it's just on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
Any second, you may suddenly appear

The people, they stop and stare, they don't bother me
'Cause there's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be
Let them all roll by, I don't care if I
As long as I'm on the street where you live

Take me back on that street
And I'ma talkin' about that street
On that crazy street, where you live
I wanna go back on that street where you live

Yeah
But alright, ah well okay, aww nuts
Street where you live

// Gee Baby Ain't I Good To You //

Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee, baby ain't I good to you?
Nothing is too good for a girl as sweet as you
Gee, baby, now ain't I good to you?

Fur coat for Christmas, diamond ring
Big, fine, foxy Cadillac car and everything
Nothing is too good for a girl as sweet as you
Gee, baby ain't I good to you?

Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee, baby ain't I good to you?
Nothing is too good for a girl as sweet as you
Gee, baby ain't I good to you?

Fur coat for Christmas, diamond ring
Big, fine, foxy Cadillac car and everything
Nothing is too good for a girl as sweet as you
Gee, baby, gee, baby

Lord, lord, lord, lord
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?

Fur coat for Christmas, diamond ring
Big, fine, foxy Cadillac car and everything
Nothing is too good for a girl as sweet as you
Gee, baby ain't I good to you?
Gee, baby ain't I good to you?

// Nice 'n' Easy //

Let's take it nice and easy
It's gonna be so easy
For us to fall in love

Hey baby what's your hurry?
Relax and don't you worry
We're gonna fall in love

We're on the road to romance, oh
That's safe to say
But let's make all the stops along the way

The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime

Oh nice 'n' easy does it
Oh nice 'n' easy does it
Oh nice 'n' easy does it every time

We're on the road to romance, oh
That's safe to say
But let's make all the stops along

The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime

Oh nice 'n' easy does it
Oh nice 'n' easy does it
Oh nice 'n' easy does it every time

// Maybe Today //

Maybe today
They'll be sunshine
Where the rain
On my side of town
Mayer for a change
The gods will rearrange
Perhaps they'll find the love to send out
And maybe today
On the rising
A surprising new face
Will appear
Maybe she'll be mine
And if if the both of us are lonely
She'll say your hearts found it's way
Maybe it might be today

// Stranger On The Shore //

Here I stand
Watching the tide go
So all alone and blue
Just dreamin' the dreams of you

I watched your ship
I watched your ship
As it sailed out to sea
Taking all of my dreams, dear
And taking all of me, yeah

The sighing of the waves
The wailing of the wind
To you my dear I love you
Oh, where do I begin?

Oh why, oh why, oh why must I
Must I go on like this?
Must I just be alone here
A stranger on the shore?

The sighing of the waves
The wailing of the wind
To you my dear I love you
Oh, where do I begin?

Oh why, oh why, oh why must I, yeah
Must I go on like this?
Must I just be alone here
Till my love returns
Must I go on like this?
All alone and feeling blue, yeah

I watched your ship
As it sailed out
Oh why, oh why
Oh why, oh why
Why, oh why, oh why
My, oh my, oh my
Stranger on the shore

// Young And Foolish //

Young and foolish
Why is it wrong to be
So very young, just a little bit foolish
Now we haven't long to be

Soon enough, the carefree days
The sunlit day roll by
And soon enough
The bluebird has to fly

Hey, we were foolish
Then one day we fell in love
Now all we do is just wonder
Just what we were thinking of

Just laughing in the sunlight
And crying in that rain
Oh I wish that we were young
And foolish again

But it's too late now
And foolish again
How can you forget?
And foolish again

// I'm Falling For You //

I'm falling for you
I'll never be blue
What can I say and what can I do?
Little girl I'm falling for you

My friends all declare
That your love isn't fair
Why would you say
That you really don't care?
Darling I'm falling for you

Although I'm not a fool dear
But if there should come a time
There's only one thing I'll ever ask
Is the maker to make you mine

'Cause you're tops in my world
And I love this affair, no I'm not a clown
My love is just down
Little darling I'm falling for you

You're tops in my world
And I love this affair
Why would you say
That you really don't care?

When you know darn well
I'm falling for you
Yeah baby, little darling
Sugar, peach, plum, honey
I'm falling for you

So watch your step
I've set my traps to get you
Watch your step
I'll get you yet, I'll bet you

Sugar, peach, plum, darling
You know I'm falling for you, yeah

// I Could Have Danced All Night //

I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
And still have danced some more
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so exciting
But all at once my heart took flight
I only know, when she began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced, all night, all night

I'll never know what made it so exciting
Well all at once my heart took flight
I only know, when she began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced, all night, all night
All night, all night
