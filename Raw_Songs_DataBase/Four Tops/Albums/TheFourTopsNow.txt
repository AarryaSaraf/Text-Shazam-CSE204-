// The Key //

A little more (More)
Love (Love)
A love that lasts past Saturday night
I need more tender (Tender)
Words (Words)
Words that say I love you every day

You've got the key to turn love loud
Turn it baby, let's don't stop
You've got the key to turn love loud
Just turn it, take it and turn it!

Notes, and loads of affection (Affection)
Affection lasting both day and night
Lots of sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet kisses (Kisses)
Kisses that turn everything [?]

You've got the key to turn love loud
Turn it baby, let's don't stop
You've got the key to turn love loud
Just turn it, hey take this key and turn it!

You've got the key, take it and turn it
You've got the key

A million smiles of joy (Joy)
A joy that stays when everything else fails
But only, only one goal (Goal)
A goal to please your every need now

You've got the key to turn love loud
Now just turn it baby, let's don't stop
You've got the key to turn love loud
Just turn it, take it and turn it!

Ohh, yeah
Now open up my heart
Turn this key and turn it
Now just turn it, open up my heart
Won't you set me free? Like a man is supposed to
Now just turn it
Take it and turn it
Whoa oh oh, turn it
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Take it and turn it

// What Is A Man? //

A man can walk proudly down in the street
A man's not ashamed of what he believes
He knows how to laugh, he knows when to cry
He knows how to live, he's not afraid to die

What is a man? What is a man?
What is a man? What is a man?

A man searches for the key to success
He'd rather be sure than make a wild guess
He knows how to love, he knows how to hate
He knows when to move and he knows just when to wait

What is a man? What is a man?
What is a man? What is a man?

A man can be angry and still hold his tongue
A man don't give up till the battle is won
He knows how to win, he's not ashamed to lose
He knows his destiny, he doesn't take long to choose

What is a man? What is a man?
What is a man? What is a man?

What is a man? Just what is a man?
What is a man?

// Don't Let Him Take Your Love From Me //

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
You don't have to tell me you've gone to found someone new.
'Cause I can feel his presence, whenever I'm-a-kissing you.
How can you ask me to try, try and understand
Well, just put yourself in my place.
Go on, just see if you can.
I'm-a begging you. (Don't, don't you let him)
Baby, please. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
I'm begging you, baby. (Don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
So what if he whispers how much he loves you in your ear.
But pay no mind 'cause I love you much more my dear
My love are like mountains.
That's how strong it is for you.
If you ever walk away in to his arms
Which will surely break my heart in two.
I'm begging you. (Don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Baby, baby, I'm begging. (Don't, don't you let him)
No, no, no, no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Oh, I couldn't stand it, baby.

If you leave me for him you would truly be unfair.
Now, just ask yourself, whenever you needed me, wasn't I always there
Now, I'm begging you, baby, baby, down on my bended knees.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, please stay here with me.
Baby, please. (Don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Baby, baby, please. (Don't, don't you let him)
I couldn't stand it. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
I ain't too proud to beg. (Don't, don't you let him)

// Eleanor Rigby //

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?

// Little Green Apples //

And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says, "Hi"
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school...goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand
And squeezes it and says, "How ya feelin', hon?"
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun

And if that's not lovin' me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'Cause she's made that way

And if that ain't lovin' me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make-believe
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves and BB guns

God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis

// Do What You Gotta Do //

Do what you gotta do
Come on back see me when you can
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better that your own kin did
From the very start it's my own fault
What happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go

So you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Now I know it'll make you feel sad
And make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me me like you should
They got ways to make you feels no good
I guess they got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And man you never lied to me
The part of you that they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me

So you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

// MacArthur Park //

Spring was never waiting for us, girl
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot, fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
The birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers 
By the trees

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have the recipe again
Oh, no

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

I will take my life into my hands 
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes 
And I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky
And after all the loves of my life
Oh, after all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no
Oh, no

No, no
Oh, no

// Don't Bring Back Memories //

(Don't bring back your memories)
Can't you let the past, let it remain in the past
Don't bring back memories, baby
For the love, doubt that couldn't lie

In each heart, there's tale of woe
For the love affair that fell through
But we must find that inner strength
That one needs to start anew
It's with my deepest regret
Baby I must forget we ever met
I've got some nights yet to live
Baby, I've got a lot of love left to give
I've got to find somebody new
Who'll appreciate the things I tried to do for you
Now those people, right by my side girl
Baby, protect her, always be her guide now

Don't you bring me those worn out memories, girl, now
Don't you bring me those obsolete memories
No no no no, my heart can't stand it
Oh, no no no no no no no no

I don't need those memories, girl
Baby, now don't you do it
My heart can't take it
Girl, oh I feel faint
It's gonna ruin my shape
Feelin' heartaches I feel with the stake
But this, I would much, much rather do
Than take another chance, chance with you
It's been my deepest regret
Baby, I just got to forget we met
I've still got some life to live
Girl, you know I got a lot of love left to give
I'm gonna find somebody new, yeah girl
That will appreciate the things I try to do
Yeah, I'm gonna keep her right by my side
Always protect her, be my only guide now

It's so hard can't take it
Antiquated memories
Rustin' memories, I don't need them
Nor do I want them

// The Fool On The Hill //

Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Round and round and round and round and round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fool
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Round and round and round and round and
