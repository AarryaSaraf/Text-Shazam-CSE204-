My energy kinetic
The fitted hat by Ebbots
(Yessir)
(DJ Drama) Yeah

I like sugar, I like sweets
I don't like the spicy eats
I need bridges in my beats
And Campana Brothers seats
The heaven part for me is knowing I can wake up when I'm finished with my sleep
Ain't no kids to feed
No stress, I bleed
I don't got a boss
I go wherever and don't care 'bout the cost (Nah)
Gas money was stark for me
Now I got so many cars, I can start up
We nappin' in parks
We in the sun gettin' darked up
Chillin' with my suit on
Travel trunk is either Moynat leather or it's Vuitton
Sippin' mint tea like we know the tree the leaf fell from
We come from them tiki punch drinks
Had annomiosty for dinner, El Pollo Loco
That was in the past, now I'm parmesan my bolognese
Half a million driftin' and the tire reading "Toyo"
Prefer the aligator logo on my on my cotton polo
Living it up, my niggas is up
Y'all niggas is salty peanuts, we ain't givin' a fuck
'Cause I'm blessed as Hell and I ain't next to jail
Ain't got no psycho hiccups
Plus I dress this well
My heaven 24/7

That's heaven (Heaven only knows)
That's heaven to me, yeah
What's heaven to you? Yeah
That's heaven to me, yeah
What's heaven to you? To y'all
Because that's heaven to me, aw-aw
(You gotta love it)

The lake water gettin' warmer from the radiant sun
My baby mama and my daughter gettin' chased by my son
The water gun is in his arms, that lil' nigga could run
He get it from his daddy side, you know, them Nigerians
My mama pulled up in a helicopter
Sister in the kitchen, kickin' Jackson, mixin' vodka
After dinner, I'll convince them they should babysit 'em
Me and wifey gettin' ready to go see an opera (Sydney)
This the house we come to when we got nothing to do
The big yard, quaint size with the immaculate view
My boat got a yacht with a slide on the side
My son and I got some bikes we could ride
I'll show him how to wheelie
And Wally hit my cell, we cleared another dealy
It's no contingency, the number's in the hundred milly's
I'm in my fourties lookin' twenty-somethin' (Yeah)
I don't ask for nothin' (Nothin')
Everything is mwah
That's heaven for a God
My health is on a hundred
You feel me?

(Skin glowin') That's heaven to me, yeah
What's heaven to you?
That's really heaven at forty, like, havin' good health
What's heaven to you? To y'all?
Because that's heaven
This-this was heaven
This was heaven at like, as a kid

It used to be the 'preme hat in the green
The cheetah print on the tee
The dark wash in the jean
Soccer mom with the Vans in every color it seems
Kids push down the block
Cuttin' dickies into shorts when it's hot
Fuckin' Wendys up
Brainstorming ways to get our pennies up
Me and Jasper spending last bucks on the city bus
Wayne tapes and Vice mags and Portishead drops
Pegleg, Ice Cream shoes, the Mr. Krabs watch
That was heaven for me
'Round time seventeen
Eggin' niggas houses, fuckin' girls from Pasadena
Bastard wasn't finished, I was forming up a team
I didn't have much but for certain I had a dream

I fuck the flow up, fuck it, I bring it back like the hairline was receding


Don't let your neighbors take you to Hell
Introduce them to heaven
Heaven only knows
