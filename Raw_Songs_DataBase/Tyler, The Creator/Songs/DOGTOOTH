She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return
Her body count and who she fuck ain't never my concern (I think it's weird)
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house (We back at it, dogtooth, yuh, dogtooth, yuh)

She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return
Except for some her time and all her love, that's my concern
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house and turn it to a yard
If you don't know my grandma name, then we ain't really dogs, bitch

I shook your hand, I don't respect
Don't call me king, I'm not your twin
I'm not your brother, we just met
See, I won't purchase (Her) no Birkin (Uh)
Got hobbies (Uh), got purpose (Woo)
Got thumpers, I'm perfect (Uh)
Yeah, kelly green wagon look better when the gloom out
Canary shine brighter in the dark, I brought the moon out
The plane fly better when it's just me and the pilot
Tuition for the mileage, it's worth it for the silence
There he go, he cast broads like radio
Shit, your lady knows, it's young T like baby clothes
And I got that fire, and I got good dick
Guap long, dick long, plus I look good, bitch (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return (Woo)
Because if she get off, then I get off, that's my concern (Uh-huh, ah, man)
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house and turn it to a yard (Yeah, yeah, turn up that shit)
If you don't know my grandma name, then we ain't really dogs, bitch

That's a lot of mothafuckin' necklace
Five, six, seven is the figure for a setlist (Yeah)
Ring, ring, ring, bitch, pick up the phone
I don't care if y'all together, I will tear down a home, shit
I shimmy through Paris in back of phantom of the threads
The driver's seat of the Enzo could barely fit my legs
And Virgil my chaperone, he look out from overhead (Love you, V)
Not sure what you overheard but it's prolly what I said, bitch
I'm out here livin', y'all on the feed (Yuck)
My girl look like Zazie Beetz and Kelis (Yuck)
I pull up in the "What the fuck is that, dawg?" (Vroom, vroom, vroom, I said, "Yuck")
It's Mr. Peculiar, that's who I be, who I be
Niggas tellin' women how they bodies supposed to be
But never take advice from any nigga with a lean gut (Fuck these niggas)
Keep your chair rockin' and my two cents in your pocket
Your only option, I don't play no mothafuckin' games

She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return (in return, turn)
And will I ever fall in love again? I can't confirm
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house and turn it to a yard
If you don't know my daughter name, then we ain't really dogs

After this
You niggas can't say nothin' (Dogtooth, dogtooth)
Suckas (Yeah, nigga, uh dogtooth, yeah dogtooth, uh)
Pull up, dogtooth, in the dogtooth
Dogtooth, woo, dogtooth
In the, uh, dogtooth, uh, uh, dogtooth
Yeah, nigga, yeah, dogtooth, in the, yeah, dogtooth, uh
