I'm downstairs
Fuck you mean?
Girl

I told your ass be ready
You always got excuses and you know I be on top of things
Punctual my proper name
On the dot is not your aim
Although we in love, we are not the same
I hit you on that celly
You said you needed five, that was more than twelve ago
Claim you got your hands tied
Time stuck like velcro
Georgia peach on east side like it's ATL, hoe

You lacking, you tripping, you slacking
Impatient, be waiting
Confused like what happened?
You get an attitude 'cause I'm getting mad
'Cause you wanna take twenty minutes and a half
On top of that, I gotta get gas
Ah, the freeway picked up traffic
What the fuck is you doin'?
We gotta dip, dip, dip, dip, dip
Cartier-yay-yay-yay
Watch go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
Waiting for that last minute for your goddamn hair
Now stop playin' games, girl
And bring yo' ass downstairs

Come on, girl, let's go
Come on, girl, let's go
Girl, you know that time that you wasting
That time that you wasting
That time that you wasting's on my dime

Come on, girl, let's go
Come on, girl, let's go
Girl, you know that time that you wasting
That time that you wasting
That time that you wasting's on my dime

Took me twenty to get ready
Shower, moisturizer, and the fit I had on yesterday
Uniform necessities
Multiples of e'rything
Now your neighbor wanna come and speak to me like
(Hey, how you doin'?) I'm good
(I ain't too bad) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Hit 'em with a few fake laughs
She talking my ear off, and sympathy I lack
I care about one thing
Where the fuck you at?

Anyway, I gotta pay a little more
See, I'm late to the jet, gotta jet 'cause I'm building an ape
And we got supper on the upper deck and the orchestra gon' play the score
For El Diablo projects
You ain't scared to change 'cause this ain't coming out your pockets
My Freudian slip, I'm rude a little bit
Don't be acting so appalled, all your girls love this shit
Put so much into tonight and you just don't care
Now stop playing games, girl, and bring your ass downstairs

Come on, girl, let's go
Come on, girl, let's go
Girl, you know that time that you wasting
That time that you wasting
That time that you wasting's on my dime

Tonight, just don't care
Stop playing games, girl, and bring your ass downstairs
Where the fuck you at?
