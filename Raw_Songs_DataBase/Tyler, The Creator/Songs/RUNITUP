Fuck you niggas talkin' to me about?
See, see, as a kid, I felt alienated by the niggas who look just like me
Niggas treat my nuance like it, like it was a nuisance so
So I was like, I was like, "Fuck 'em"
Fuck 'em, I did my own shit, and now I'm up and now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety, I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is
When they talk about, "That nigga," I'm him, I'm him, I'm that nigga
(Run)
It's funny, right? (Run)
For some reason, y'all didn't really think we was gon' be here (Run)
See for y'all, the sky is the limit
For us, the sky is just what we stand on to reach the beyond (Run, run, run)
High above the clouds, as you see us (Gangsta)
Catch up, niggas

Bitch, I'm runnin' up the check like I got Rafs on (Run, run)
And I'm runnin' out of shit 'cause I got racks on me (Run)
Bitch, I'm runnin' (Run)

I like to spend it all (We gon' run it up, run)
Here today, but gone tomorrow (We gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up, woo, woo, woo)

He off the dope (Yeah)
We off it, we off the boat (Okay, true story, run)
Crosshairs to heat off, we tee off like G-olf, we (Phew-phew-phew)
We see off the scope
So I (Run), ran (Run)
Bunnyhop in, zoomed in
Ever since I hit two tens
Love the faces with the blue skin
With the green background, don't know how to act now (Now)
But I need unagi on my bluefin (Yeah)
Fiends moonwalk when I come (Yeah)
Deaf hoes speak when I'm here (Yeah, here)
The dead hit sprints when I hum (Yeah)
Why you actin' so dumb? Bitch, you know I got the funds (Now)
I'm live from the 310
Green Goblin, it bend tires (Ah)
No , they send photos, I send wires
Gumballs cool me down, I'm on fire
Can't fuck with him (Yeah)
Rap (Rap music, nigga)
Helped us see clear when the lightin' was dim, dim
We ain't nothin' to you, but we somethin' to them, them
When you in your room and you starin' at the ceilin'
Dreamin', I want you to know it's no ceilings
I want you to notice that feelin'
I want you to leave and go for it (Yeah)
I want you to reach with no fearing
Throat clearing, scream it, let 'em hear it
Run that shit up, baby (Yeah)

(We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up) Let's go up, baby
(We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
We gon' run it up)
Here today but gone tomorrow (We gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all
(We gon' run it up, run it up, we gon' run it up)
(We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up)

I'm runnin' like a politician (We gon' run it up)
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like (We gon' run it up)
Runnin' like the water on the dirty dishes (We gon' run it up)
I'm runnin', I'm runnin' like there's roaches in the kitchen (We gon' run it up)

We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it, we gon' run it
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
