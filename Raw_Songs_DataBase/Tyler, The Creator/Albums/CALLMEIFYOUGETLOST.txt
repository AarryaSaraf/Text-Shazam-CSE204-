Look, tried to take somebody bitch 'cause I'm a bad person
I don't regret shit because that ... worth it
In the end, she picked him, I hope when they fuckin'

I'ma get that deep text when this verse surface
Better send it to my ego 'cause that shit hurtin'
Hope y'all shit workin' (True story), I'm a psycho, huh?
Don't give a fuck, you left my heart twerkin'
Movin', losin', grip on my doings (Yeah)
Eyes is cryin' on the jet cruisin' (Phew-phew-phew)
'Bout to spend millions just to fill voids up
Drama, I need you (Yessir), can you turn the noise up?
Can you turn the noise up? Can you turn the noise up? (Go, go, go, go)
Turn the fuckin' noise up, ah, nigga, my heart broken
Remembered I was rich, so I bought me some new emotions
And a new boat 'cause I'd rather cry in the ocean

Listen to bands, groove and we dance
Disco in France, smell some perfume, head in the wind (In the wind)

If you got a man, you should cut him off
Get your passport 'cause we runnin' off (Run off)

"Oh, my God, I never seen nothin' like this"
Haha, that's what my mom was sayin'
She, she was cryin' and shit
It was, she was just like, "This shit is beautiful"
It was a beautiful moment

'Cause you, you never know (Gangsta Grillz)
You never know where the fuck you gon' end up at

Niggas ain't really on the type of shit he on
I hit Drizzy and told him I had a milli' for him (Oh shit)
I own my companies full, told 'em to keep the loan
I took that gold bitch home, niggas was big mad (Ugh, oh shit)
I put that bitch on the shelf to let it ventilate
And bought another car 'cause I ain't know how to celebrate (Top shelf, nigga)
That big boy, that big bitch for all weather
It never rain in Cali', came with an umbrella (Ooh)

Rolls-Royce pull up, Black boy hop out (Man, what the fuck?)

Nigga this the face, man I wish a nigg...(It's the face)
It's different, it's really different (Catch up, niggas)

Ayo, I might sled in Utah, LA is too warm
My nigga tall, look like a bitch, I call him Mulan (Hey, oh)
Salad colored emerald on finger, the size of croutons
Niggas can not fuck with performance of magic (Oh), new wand (Nigga)
That's my nuance, used to be the weirdo (Ah)
Used to laugh at me, listen to me with their ears closed
Used to treat me like that boy from Malcolm in the Middle (Why I'm motherfuckin' rich)
Now I'm zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero (That's six)

Rolls-Royce pull up (Zero), Black boy hop out (That's seven)
Nah, I can't take this shit no more, man, I quit
That's it, I quit, I swear to God, nigga

Fuck you mean, nigga?

// HOT WIND BLOWS //

Ladies and gentlemen
We just landed in Geneva
Yeah, that's in Switzerland
We on a yacht
A young lady just fed me French vanilla ice cream
We all got our toes out, too
Call me when you get lost

I'ma travel the globe, you keep the block hot
Driver, open the door for me, my hand hurt
Finders, we playin' hide-and-seek with the passports
Where the fuck we at? Oh, the pilot gotta remind us, yeah
The luggage is pilin', I need a close-to-us (Woo)
So many stinky sit in my wallet, look like a folden chair (Yeah)
The Cartier so light on my body thought I floated here
We boated here, it's Tunechi and Tyler but call me Baudelaire, yeah
Out in Switzerland, travel with my bitch (Nigga), yeah, we kissin', dawg
I love when she let me rub her like Michelin (Skrrt, skrrt, facts)
A hundred grand to sleep on a bird, the wings are whistlin' like—
Man, they ain't listenin'
Cross the line like immigrants and benefit from it
Keep on stuntin' on these niggas, make 'em sick to they stomach, man (I can't stop it)
Y'all don't understand, fish so fresh that you could taste the same
Yeah, we gettin' lost but we know who we am (True story)
By the, by the, by the, by the some-some-somethin'
Treat that last part like you niggas ain't sayin' nothin'

(Are we?)
Yeah, haha
You see these excursions right here?
Just too lavish to post on the 'Gram (Gangsta Grillz)
Uh (Tunechi)

Excuse me, pardon me, the wind, it blow so hard to me
Like mother nature arguing about some baby father beepin'
I'm stuck in the middle of the sandwich like slaughter meat
Got my middle fingers to the cameras that's recording me
From y'all to me, brrt, stop callin' me unless you're ordering
I'm on the beach, I got my feet out, and I stay on my feet
The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me
Thought all this lean will have me senile, I guess they see now
Let's touch down, catch a beat-down like I catch touchdowns
I fuck 'round and slow the beat down and take the drums out
The speed of my plum so great, I'ma eat my own flow
And I'm in need of a flaw, may eat me a rapper, I might as well eat me a ho (Oh)
I'm hot as hell when the weather is freezin' the cold, as the devil and demon and ghost
I'ma get even and even, get even some more, it's too late to even get low, baow
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, that's what I need you to know, Mula, Weezy the goat
The wind beneath my wings, Desert Eagle underneath my coat
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mula (Bitch)

(Are we?)
(On the boat, nigga)
You see
We just over here admirin' the view of the mountains from the lake
Of course
Y'all know it's Wolf Haley, man, stop fuckin' playin'
