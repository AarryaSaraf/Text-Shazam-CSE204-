You pick a spot, I pick a tail number and we can be tourists (Ooh, yeah)
Let's go to Cannes and watch a couple indie movies that you never heard of (Baby)
Listen to bands, groove and we dance
Disco in France, smell some perfume, head in the wind (In the wind)

Get your passport 'cause we runnin' off (Run off)

Your body compared to the fashion

Haha, that's what my mom was sayin'
She, she was cryin' and shit
It was, she was just like, "This shit is beautiful"
It was a beautiful moment

She went like "Ah, this the wish-a-nigga-could face" (Uh)
They ain't gettin' paper like they should, wait

Niggas ain't really on the type of shit he on
I hit Drizzy and told him I had a milli' for him (Oh shit)
I own my companies full, told 'em to keep the loan
I took that gold bitch home, niggas was big mad (Ugh, oh shit)
I put that bitch on the shelf to let it ventilate
And bought another car 'cause I ain't know how to celebrate (Top shelf, nigga)
That big boy, that big bitch for all weather

My nigga tall, look like a bitch, I call him Mulan (Hey, oh)
Salad colored emerald on finger, the size of croutons
Niggas can not fuck with performance of magic (Oh), new wand (Nigga)
That's my nuance, used to be the weirdo (Ah)
Used to laugh at me, listen to me with their ears closed
Used to treat me like that boy from Malcolm in the Middle (Why I'm motherfuckin' rich)
Now I'm zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero (That's six)

Rolls-Royce pull up (Zero), Black boy hop out (That's seven)

// HOT WIND BLOWS //

Ladies and gentlemen
We just landed in Geneva
Yeah, that's in Switzerland
We on a yacht
A young lady just fed me French vanilla ice cream
We all got our toes out, too
Call me when you get lost

I'ma travel the globe, you keep the block hot
Driver, open the door for me, my hand hurt
Finders, we playin' hide-and-seek with the passports
Where the fuck we at? Oh, the pilot gotta remind us, yeah
The luggage is pilin', I need a close-to-us (Woo)
So many stinky sit in my wallet, look like a folden chair (Yeah)
The Cartier so light on my body thought I floated here
We boated here, it's Tunechi and Tyler but call me Baudelaire, yeah
Out in Switzerland, travel with my bitch (Nigga), yeah, we kissin', dawg
I love when she let me rub her like Michelin (Skrrt, skrrt, facts)
A hundred grand to sleep on a bird, the wings are whistlin' like—
Man, they ain't listenin'
Cross the line like immigrants and benefit from it
Keep on stuntin' on these niggas, make 'em sick to they stomach, man (I can't stop it)
Y'all don't understand, fish so fresh that you could taste the same
Yeah, we gettin' lost but we know who we am (True story)
By the, by the, by the, by the some-some-somethin'
Treat that last part like you niggas ain't sayin' nothin'

(Are we?)
Yeah, haha
You see these excursions right here?
Just too lavish to post on the 'Gram (Gangsta Grillz)
Uh (Tunechi)

Excuse me, pardon me, the wind, it blow so hard to me
Like mother nature arguing about some baby father beepin'
I'm stuck in the middle of the sandwich like slaughter meat
Got my middle fingers to the cameras that's recording me
From y'all to me, brrt, stop callin' me unless you're ordering
I'm on the beach, I got my feet out, and I stay on my feet
The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me
Thought all this lean will have me senile, I guess they see now
Let's touch down, catch a beat-down like I catch touchdowns
I fuck 'round and slow the beat down and take the drums out
The speed of my plum so great, I'ma eat my own flow
And I'm in need of a flaw, may eat me a rapper, I might as well eat me a ho (Oh)
I'm hot as hell when the weather is freezin' the cold, as the devil and demon and ghost
I'ma get even and even, get even some more, it's too late to even get low, baow
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, that's what I need you to know, Mula, Weezy the goat
The wind beneath my wings, Desert Eagle underneath my coat
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mula (Bitch)

(Are we?)
(On the boat, nigga)
You see
We just over here admirin' the view of the mountains from the lake
Of course
Y'all know it's Wolf Haley, man, stop fuckin' playin'

// MASSA //

Whatever your shit is, man, do it
Whatever bring you that immense joy, do that, that's your luxury
The greatest thing that ever happened to me was
Bein' damn near twenty and leavin' Los Angeles for the first time
I got out my bubble, my eyes, just wide
My passport is the most valuable

Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me, ehm, I'ma just go

Yeah, when I turned twenty-three that's when puberty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit me
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?
See, I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changin' from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, uhm
Thankfully, by hour three that detour perspective, uhm
Thoughts change so rapid, turn into a butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzz, be they buzz, scream, they love me
First time I private airline, accolade, song got airtime
Went to my style, body, and feelings and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, been there since tens of millions
I'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at 1-9
Mom was in the shelter when "Yonkers" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah, yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes, takin' that shit is stupid
A flower gets its petal, they pluck it but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, when does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows

Massa couldn't catch me, my legs longer than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me up but I keep short like Caesar
Eyes open if I pray 'cause I can't trust God either, uh

See, right there, you got one life to live
How far do you really wanna take it?
Don't let 'em ever tell you nothin' you can't do

Yeah, I purchase more wheels when I feel like I'm third-wheelin'
My favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'
The panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin'
That ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'
I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-o-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle, covered in grass, lichen, gravel (Yeah)
It come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin' sweet ain't you heard? (Ain't you heard nigga?)
This perspective from the beak of a bird
You hope I peak, you take my peace
You gon' see me run, like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungaroos because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full
You can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me, "It's not good," from your lunch break

Holiday season
A vision you have to understand from perspective
Check your resources, nigga

// RUNITUP //

Fuck you niggas talkin' to me about?
See, see, as a kid, I felt alienated by the niggas who look just like me
Niggas treat my nuance like it, like it was a nuisance so
So I was like, I was like, "Fuck 'em"
Fuck 'em, I did my own shit, and now I'm up and now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety, I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is
When they talk about, "That nigga," I'm him, I'm him, I'm that nigga
(Run)
It's funny, right? (Run)
For some reason, y'all didn't really think we was gon' be here (Run)
See for y'all, the sky is the limit
For us, the sky is just what we stand on to reach the beyond (Run, run, run)
High above the clouds, as you see us (Gangsta)
Catch up, niggas

Bitch, I'm runnin' up the check like I got Rafs on (Run, run)
And I'm runnin' out of shit 'cause I got racks on me (Run)

He off the dope (Yeah)
We off it, we off the boat (Okay, true story, run)
Crosshairs to heat off, we tee off like G-olf, we (Phew-phew-phew)
We see off the scope
So I (Run), ran (Run)
Bunnyhop in, zoomed in
Ever since I hit two tens
Love the faces with the blue skin
With the green background, don't know how to act now (Now)
But I need unagi on my bluefin (Yeah)
Fiends moonwalk when I come (Yeah)
Deaf hoes speak when I'm here (Yeah, here)
The dead hit sprints when I hum (Yeah)
Why you actin' so dumb? Bitch, you know I got the funds (Now)
I'm live from the 310
Green Goblin, it bend tires (Ah)
No [?], they send photos, I send wires
Gumballs cool me down, I'm on fire
Can't fuck with him (Yeah)
Rap (Rap music, nigga)
Helped us see clear when the lightin' was dim, dim
We ain't nothin' to you, but we somethin' to them, them
When you in your room and you starin' at the ceilin'
Dreamin', I want you to know it's no ceilings
I want you to notice that feelin'
I want you to leave and go for it (Yeah)
I want you to reach with no fearing
Throat clearing, scream it, let 'em hear it
Run that shit up, baby (Yeah)

(We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up) Let's go up, baby
(We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
We gon' run it up)
Here today but gone tomorrow (We gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up)

I'm runnin' like, runnin' like (We gon' run it up)
Runnin' like the water on the dirty dishes (We gon' run it up)
I'm runnin', I'm runnin' like there's roaches in the kitchen (We gon' run it up)

We gon' run it up

// MANIFESTO //

Lil' white bitch gon' say
"You need to say something about that"
"You need to say somethin' 'bout black..."
Bitch, suck my...
Yeah
Go time

That ain't in your religion, you just followin' your mammy
She followed your granny, she obeyed master
Did y'all even ask her? Questions, it's holes in them stories
Is it, holes in your blessings? Yeah, I'm bold with the message
I know I ain't got the answer
But I ain't gon' cheerlead with y'all just to be a dancer
I'ma groove to my own drums, sunlight in my shadow, baby
Move 'til my soul comes, let them serpents rattle, baby

Crackin' like broke porcelain, bitch
We ocean deep if you just pour us in a portion of shit
Them people try to twist my view on some contortionist shit
I had to reevaluate what was important and shit (O-F)
Finders, keepers, when you creep inside my mind it's madness (Yeah)
If I see peace, I'm like a fiend (Ooh), uh, gotta have it
Lord, cover me I'm goin' in, walls closin' in (Uh)
How I'm supposed to be protected (Huh?) when the laws want us in?
Y'all want us dead, just 'cause the skin is the black type (Ah)
Teach me everything and be amazed I don't act right
What the fuck?
I'm tappin' the matrix, I'm back and they hate it
I'm black and make 'em pay me capital statements, you dig?
Word on my back, I'm tryna fashion a statement
I ain't no bastard, we the master of the path that we blazin', you dig? (What?)
(On God, now)

I came a long way from my past, nigga, it's obvious
V12 engine, I'm fishtailing on some sloppy shit (Skrrrrt)
Internet bringin' old lyrics up, like I hide the shit
What's your address, I could probably send you a copy, bitch
I was canceled before canceled was with Twitter fingers (Haha)
Protestin' outside my shows, I gave them the middle finger (Fuck 'em)
I was a teener, tweetin' Selena crazy shit
Didn't wanna offend her, apologize when I seen her
Back when I was tryna fuck Bieber, Just-in
I say with my chest out, you say with your chest in, nigga (Say it with your chest, nigga)
Black bodies hanging from trees, I cannot make sense of this (Uh)
Hit some protest up, retweeted positive messages (Uh)
Donated some funds then I went and copped me a necklace
I'm probably a coon, and your standard's based on this evidence
Am I doin' enough or not doin' enough?
I'm tryna run with the baton, but see, my shoe's in the mud
I feel like anything I say, dawg, I'm screwin' shit up (Sorry)
So I just tell these black babies, they should do what they want
Freedom, need 'em, my niggas, seen 'em
Free 'em, don't fuck with the law like, damn, Gina
So calm the fuck down before we duck rounds
And fireballs that make your family have to duck the fuck down
We frontline, we got the mazel tov that we can chuck now (Woo)
'Cause anytime we movin' up, it's like a "What the fuck now?"
They playin' games, we strappin' up, we cockin' aim (Yeah)
We aim to shoot, we shoot to claim what we need
We done with pain and the grievin', niggas is done with the peace
Whether it's personal or for the whole of niggas, indeed (Yah)
I might not have dreadlocks, I might have these gold teeth
But I'm a nigga like you, and you's a nigga like me (Yeah)
So let's be niggas together, and let's be niggas with plans
But put this plastic on first, 'cause shit is hittin' the fan, Scott

Shit like this make me wanna turn my baseball cap to the side
You know, with the T.I. lean
Y'all fake mad
Catch up, niggas
Gettin' y'all identity, huh?
Gangsta Grillz
Go get a fuckin' hobby
Shit
Ain't nobody perfect
Well, at least y'all ain't, hah

// SWEET / I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE //

["SWEET"]

No, no, no, no, no, listen, listen
(Call when you get lost, lost)
The driver gon' drop you off
(Call me when you get lost, lost)
A'ight, it's warm, the waterfall is crazy
I don't know, make somethin' up, tell him somethin'
Uh, come on
Still on the boat?
Call me if you get lost

You and I, we fell in love
I read the signs, ain't know what it was
But God gotta know he might have peaked when he made you
The cosmos' only mistake is what they named you (What that mean?)

They should call you sugar, you so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar, girl, you so sweet to me
Boy, they should call you sugar, sugar, oh, you so sweet
'Cause baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known

Baby, you're the sweetest thing

Even if you left me out here stranded
My feelings wouldn't change a bit
(You know how I feel about you, are you ready?)
You know how I feel, baby
Infinite, the love I have for you
A diamond couldn't put a dent in it
Uh, go to the bridge thing (Okay)

Darling, you're the wind under my wings
My heart beats triple time when I see ya
Somethin' I can't control
If I compared you, the Sun is withstandin' (Sun)
You got a smile that could light up a planet (Smile), yeah (Oh, oh)
And I just wanted you to know (They should call you)

They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar (Why?), 'cause you're so sweet to me (Sugar)
Boy, they should call you sugar (Sugar), you're so sweet (Oh, oh)
'Cause baby you the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known (Ooh, girl)

(Sweetest)

They should call you sugar, you so sweet
(Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar)
Well, they should call you sugar, girl (Why?), you so sweet to me
Boy, they should call you sugar
You so sweet (You so sweet, yeah)
'Cause baby you the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest (I know)

And you look so good (Yeah)
And you smell so good (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you taste so good (Yeah)
Oh you so, so good (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the sweetest (Yeah, you are, haha)
Sweet like a motherfuckin' brown sugar, sweet potatoes (Are you ready?)
Or somethin'
Haha
Oh, yeah

The plan was to stick my toe in and
Check the temperature but
Next thing I know
I'm drownin'
Appelle-moi si tu te perds

["THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE"]

This here for the sunseekers
Run the track

What makes you think
I'm not in love?
How could you know
What's best for us?
Why am I here
Standing alone?
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance, yeah
(Welcome to the disco)

You so good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it felt good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You so good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You so good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

So, what makes you think (What makes you think)
I'm not in love? (I'm not in love?)
And how could you know (How could you know)
What's best for us? (What's best for us?, us, us, us)
Why am I here (Why am I here)
Standing alone? (Standing alone?)
Because I thought you wanted to dance with me

Honestly, it's all love all the time, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I ain't mean to lead you on, because
Hear me, I've got some things I was trying
But my energy belongs to you
I want you so bad, but not too fast
It's not your fault we can't pretend because
What can go wrong?

So what makes you think
I'm not in love? (Feels so good)
How could you know, know, know
What's best for us?
Why am I here
Standing alone?
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance, yeah
(Run the track)
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance
('Cause I thought you wanted to dance with me)
I thought you wanted to dance
('Cause I thought you wanted to dance with me)
I thought you wanted to dance

I wish that we never met, I wish that we ain't connect
Like Lego, connection good, but mixed signal if you say so, like cardio
We sat up and down, but we didn't blink, felt like dirty dishes
'Cause we was in sync, I swear to God if you and him never linked
I tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I make them glasses roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you picked me with your voice
I'm twenty-five, love, but I came by a choice
You promised to me but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm catching a...
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
Your seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus we spend time and we repeat and we rewinding
Your headlights had hit my eyelid
Love is blind and y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing, how y'all doing? Oh, you choosin' him?
Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck
I ain't been sleepin' well, twin I'll never tell
Stay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in
I stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (Dance)
I thought you wanted to dance, I (Dance)

Baby, baby (For you)
What's the chance, though?
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you
So don't forget about me, ba-ba-ba-da
I'll save a dance just for you
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you (Only for you, only for you)
So don't forget about me (No), ba-ba-ba-da
I'll save a dance just for you

// MOMMA TALK //

His daddy fine, I'm fine, what you thought?
Shit, his daddy fine
Nah, his daddy, his momma fine, bitch
What you mean? He got his looks from me
You better tell this ho, this my nigga, though
My ride or die, I'd kill a motherfucker over this one right here, nigga
I'd stand in front of a bullet, on God, over this one
My son used to record me beatin' bitches' ass, facts
I didn't give a fuck
I, I bossed up on teachers, principals, mamas, kids
I didn't give a fu-am I lying?
You have no reason to
No
If you fuck with my kids, I'll beat up kids over my kid, okay?
This little boy used to run, he was scared
I said, "Go get your bitch-ass mama"
I would beat your whole family and didn't give a fuck
They be like, "Tyler, Tyler mama crazy, Tyler mama crazy"
Yup, don't fuck with my kids
Tyler would be like "Get 'em, mom"
But she like "No, don't do it"
Tyler would be like "Get 'em, mom, get 'em"
"No, mom, don't do it"
I'd be like "Shut yo ass up"
She cryin' "Noo—"

// RISE! //

"Mom get em," shut yo' ass up!
Dedicated to the haters, the non-believers, and the disgruntled
Oh, no, I don't want you to leave
I want you to stay right here and watch Tyler rise to the top
It feels better that way

Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay (Watch what comes next)
Please don't go, yeah, please just stay
Please don't go, yeah, please just stay
Please don't go, yeah, please just stay
Please don't go, yeah (You know my style)

When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now
I'm tellin' you right now
Oh, I'll show you something
When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now
As crazy as I sound
Oh, I'll show you something
(You might as well just get comfortable)
That's it

Niggas want they merit (Yeah)
Need some cash flow, shawty want some credit (Ah, yeah)
Ah, nigga, you should be embarrassed (Yeah)
You ain't the only nigga that be in Paris (Ah, yeah)
This shit dead, believe the paramedics (Nah)
You ain't where you at in your head, shit is apparent (Oh, yeah)
You ain't head nigga 'round here, you with the sheriff (Word)
You ain't seeing shit how it is, get you some carrots
Let me say this shit right here so niggas hear it (Ah)
Everything involved in your life is fuckin' pathetic (Ah)
Tyler got the talent, Tyler got the vision (Oh)
Tyler that nigga so really you can't compare us
Why you filled with terror whenever you in my presence? (Why?)
Is it 'cause we look just alike and niggas said it? (Why?)
I will never lose any sleep, I'm never sweatin'
And I'll always be ahead of you, nigga, don't you forget it

When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now
I'm tellin' you right now
Oh, I'll show you something
If I rise to the top
Tellin' you right now
As crazy as I sound
I'll show you something (Man)

With the rockets in my mind, yeah
I could touch the sky, I don't see any ceilin' (Right now)
And if I fall, there's always to my room
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yo)

Let me show you punk motherfuckers what I know (Yeah)
See, I know, I'm the guy that took a chance like Chicago (Yeah)
So I win, I can do this shit with my eyes closed
Can't tell the difference like Michael's vitiligo, yeah
There he go again (Woo)
They tried to boycott him but he didn't dim (Oh, yeah)
He started from the bottom and they went to fall off
Like he skipped autumn and spring-summer winds
Look, you tell me I can't, I tell you I can (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
You tell me I can't, I do it again
Reversin' the job, like blowin' a fan (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
No matter which way you look at it
Understand, it's plugged in
You tell me it's nine lives, I'm pushin' it up, ten
You tell me to do five, I'm pushin' a buck ten
I might just cut off the brakes and aim for the sidelines (Ahhh)
For you nothin'-ass niggas and screamin' out "Fuck him", fuck them

When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now (It's GOLF, we're watching the show)
I'm tellin' you right now
Oh, I'll show you something (It's gonna be a little painful for ya)
When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now (You gotta love it)
As crazy as I sound
Oh, I'll show you something (Ba-ba-ba-da-daiya)

So, so, so, so
(I'm talking about the tippy-tippy-top)
(Your ladder will never allow you to get to these heights)
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay (I can't fuck with me)
Please don't go, please just stay (None of y'all can fuck with me)
Please don't go yet, please just stay (None of y'all niggas can fuck with me)
Please don't go yet, please just stay
Please don't go yet, please just stay (Y'all can fuck with me, baby)
Please don't go yet (I'm right here!)

// BLESSED //

Niggas is blessed

Golf Wang's doing amazing, might open up another store
Le FLEUR* is goin' insane, smell good, nail polish
Converse, Gucci, Camp Flog Gnaw one of the best festivals
I'm healthy, my skin glowin', my friends healthy
I'm fuckin' who, what, when, where, haha
Karen and Alex Moss 'bout to drop off some new pieces
I'm out here scorin' commercials, movies soon
We writin' shows, man, life is fuckin' beautiful
I done fell in love and th-th-the—
The only flaw is my fuckin' hair won't grow
It's been like two years and this shit like two inches
Come get lost with me, man, come, come, come see the world
When you, when you really get out there, call me, I'll be there
And I don't take jets like that, I'm scared to go broke, so
I don't take none of this shit for granted
It's opulence, baby

// JUGGERNAUT //

Hey Miss Parker
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Somethin' like (Uh-oh)
I just cut some fresh lemons, where's the sugar?
Lemon in my 'ade, lemon in my ears, call 'em boogers
Rather six feet 'fore I'm ever seen with you niggas (Hold up)
Yeah

What it is? It's that nigga T, skin look colored in (Woo)
Ridin' in double-double R, that's that Cullinan (Yeah)
Pullin' in that four hundred gram, I just bought a disc (Yeah)
Switzerland, Lake Geneva where I spend my summer in (True story)
Golf le Fleur, that's Gianno shoe, what I'm runnin' in
Earlobe look like headlights on a new van (Gangsta Grillz)
I'm so motherfuckin' dead-ass, I need some Timberlands (Woo)
I battle any man, Uzi Vert, don't think they understand (Yeah, yeah)

Uh (Skrrt, cool), double C on my feet
Double G on my freak (Ooh), Louis V by my brick
She wan' kick it with me, she better eat it then leave (Leave, whoa)
She try save 'bout the place but keep eatin' my meat
We can't see none of 'em, bro, she keep eatin' my seeds (Woo)
Got a E and a B on the back of the CT
I'm done with the 12, got a V16 (Uh)
Say the money comin' in, yeah, that's true
The more money I get, I don't wan' sex you
Can't think about the last time that I text you
It's probably one Sidekicks out them belt loops
Sign my John Hancock on a bitch every time I check you
Just like a brand new Lamb', I wreck you, uh
So if this mind is yours (Woo, woo, woo)

Ride to the dinner tapin'
Outta time and imagine her in the exit
Last year more than what Google say my net is
I got chatter with the chef in the tinted exit (Like, whoa)
Yeah, uh, uh, uh, whoa

It's the double P, I rock double C
Man, I run them beats like you run in cleats
Man, come to me, you want somethin' to see
This internally flawed, that's a double Vs
What troubles me is you couple me
With these subtle fleas tryna double league
Hornet trapped in the hive of a motherfuckin' bumblebee
They just got the closest picture of the fuckin' sun surface, that was us
Got the LaFerrari, park that bitch just for one purpose, catchin' dust
My Secret Service carry mops, you call 'em street sweepers, back you up
Tat' you up then add you up, then give you a cover like Adwoa
If the shit's fake, I don't respect it, it's clickbait
And that's distaste like a shit shake
What a difference your wrist make when it's Richard-made
Hungry eyes tend to fixate like a empty stomach for a fish plate
Shit-faced, get this straight, this is truck wheels that grip tape

Ride to the dinner tapin'
Outta time and imagine her in the exit (Why you even talkin' to us?)
Last year more than what Google say my net is (Goddamn)
I got chatter with the chef in the tinted exit
Uh, uh, uh

// WILSHIRE //

Mhm, fuck, yeah

Met you on a Saturday, knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fuckin' across the table, don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was comin' the city you from
Maybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb
If I denied long legs, good ears, great taste
Smell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face
And we clicked, we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense, you stay back at my tele'
We was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy
I wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same but you got homie you dealin' with
Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected
But I get it, it's whatever, least I could do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him
It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together, never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day
And they say, "Bros over hoes," I'm like, "Mm, nah, hey"
I would rather hold your hand and have a cool handshake
But whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be champs
I'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh

It's, it's like starting a race
And then when you take off, they like, "No, no, it's not a end," huh
It was too late and shit

FaceTimin', that ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage
It's nothin' incriminatin' but please delete our discussions
You hit me with that look and replied like, "Duh, bitch"
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Crossed the line, crossed the line, crossed the—, nah, we never did that
Though I haven't seen him in months, shit, it's rare he never hit back
Anyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it
Right in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid
He see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, "Ha-ha-ha"
Whenever we "Ha-ha-ha," we suddenly press his buttons
Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose
If I fuck our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it
But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it
And plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real
Surface

I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots
Like, I'm the new nigga
But you know, they be fuckin', haha
Yuh, yuh

Didn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me
Know y'all argue 'bout if you mad, you met him before you met me
I feel guilty but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control but not as much as I could
I been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you, you

You know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs
But it's like, "No, I want that," haha

He left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head
You dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, "No, you pick a place"
Week in Tulum, a week in Capri, or die right here
As long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh
You was supposed to go back home then see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week
You was like, "Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that"
Seven days with me, your nigga like, "Where the fuck you at?"
Dirtyin' my bakin' pot, tennis at my mama's spot
Chauffered in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants
Parts playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names
Manicures, night swims, Gerard providin' methane
Shoppin' til we droppin', what you coppin'?
See, the price is not a option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him, you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer but you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?
And y'all know that we friends but we both aware that it's more
Everything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours
The only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care 'bout me could see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in
Men or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em
But with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'
You stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of the car with you and talk about who we are
You told me when you with me, it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and
Told me that you didn't wanna hurt him while we doin' this
Told me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him, it started problems, and
Told me every time you not with me, you always ponder
What type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding
Girl, you know that I'm a player whenever, that's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off
He picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off
My energy like, "Get lost," your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he see me make you smile, that nigga threatenin' as shit
I'm in the wrong, though
I picked you up, your energy off
Your lips really dry, something is off
You ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta
We trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata
We sat in the car and cried for a hour
My shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls
Know I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell
They buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need 'Vil
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagara
Ville right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or
Do something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box, I thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend
No, fuck that, the energy we had, never again we'll find it
You in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it—aw, fuck
We talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit when you in relationship
And you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint
'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home
Shit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along
But shit, I take my L, though, it's not fun
You still got your nigga and still had your fun
Shit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh
This my perspective, this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real
I told you I loved you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you, promise I get him killed, true
True, true, true, yeah

On God, I love that girlfriend
I'm a sh—, I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person
I had no ill intentions, though
Shit, everybody got hurt
I got hurt, bruh
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have is vanished when a certain energy is nearin'
And those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control
It made me realize that those don't know what they doin' either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's children, man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong, man
I felt two hundred percent with her
It's beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was, it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
But I guess you're just another chapter in a book

// SAFARI //

Destination remote
We done been everywhere
Only thing we ain't traveled is time (Yo)

The boy records smell like bleach
I can travel where I want
I'm accustomed clearin' customs
It ain't custom, I don't come
Flee the bird to the truck
I scroll every water to stewardess
Border control, that's some stupid shit
Stayin' at home, I hate
Runaway love but I'm no Ludacris
Sippin' on mint tea, take my shoes off
Then we take off then I snooze off
Until I land, know I'm four grand
And I wake up, have to droop off
Got my passport in my weak hand
I'ma cool off, get a sweet tan
Loafers filled with beach sand
We climb 'til we find the peace sign
Fuck all the checks and the calls, get a passport
See the world, open your eyes 'til your back hurt
Niggas get bread and won't leave, shit is backwards
Start with your feet then a car then a airport
Get our your bubble gum
Blow up horizons, sun
Sled in the Alps or go tube in Missoula
Or tour in Japan or go scuba in Cuba
Or land in a borough, Gerard got the brioche
Ciabatta in Como, it matches my peacoat
Oversee the sea, all the things that you could see
Like them languages I speak, out in Paris for a week
Take my nephews out to Nice, they like "Who?" I'm like, "Oui", ha

Every car retarded, the garage look like a loony bin
What coupe he in depends on the fit and the type of mood he in (Ugh)
I been switchin' gears since Tracee Ellis Ross was UPN
Clutched then he stroked, got to know her like a droopy grin (Ugh)
Huh, took that Grammy home, couldn't lose again
The suit was so sharp that it could get Medusa coochie trim (Ugh)
Hov talkin' 'bout a hundred million, nigga, loop me in
Like who that young, rich, handsome nigga with the gooey skin? (Ugh)
Mama named him Tyler and his brothers call him T
And the bank, they call him when that wire clear like season three or somethin' (Ugh)
Skateboard named him Bunnyhop, it's Baudelaire Wolfie though
The felines name him Al for how long he eat the— (Pussy) wait a minute (Ugh)
Pink loafers scuff quickly, Fiat cost a buck sixty

I'm fishtailin', I said, I'm fishtailin' (With everything we accomplish)
I'm fishtailin', ain't no tellin' if I'm out of control (Yeah, it's still so much more to do)

Hawthorne, California, years that I was formin' up
Before the world would know me and I would come and perform for ya
I was baby bossin' things outside of my cornea
In the world with mama, where papa didn't show up for us
I ain't let it phase me, I just focused on my wishes
Execute ideas and accumulate multi-millions (Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow)
Get a bigger house with a kitchen to cook our meals in
No niggas that can press me whenever I exit buildin'
A boy on handlebars that would listen to all my demos
That list was 'bout as long as a limo, but, here's the memo
Them niggas that look like me treat my nuance as a nuisance
So they would segregate me 'cause I didn't match they blueprint
What you think that's tied to, shit? They don't know, but I do
So we don't match in eye view, nigga, you peaked in high school
So we can not compare, your perspective is stuck, goner
'Cause I was signin' eight-figure checks with my gloves on

I'm fishtailin', I'm fishtailin'
I'm fishtailin', ain't no tellin' if I'm out of control (Don't regret tomorrow what you didn't do today)
(Dreams can always become reality)
I'm just livin' my life as the best I see
If it don't excites me, we not the same team
Watchin' comma, comma, comma since I turned nineteen
So do not pay me no mind

Yeah
"How it feel? How it feel?" My nigga, it's so good
Smile on that baby face, schooling I was fuckin' up
Focused, I was comin' up, them kiddies had them tumbles up
Was nineteen years of age when my pockets was 'bout a hundred up
How I get them checks off, nigga?
I ate and I paid my mama's debt off, nigga
Now the pay stubs is silly, it's millis from old banter
The ice near my shoulders colder than Homelander
No lackin', ma, the jimmy is strapped like some old sandals
I don't brag 'em, but she said my shit longer than old phantoms (Skrrt)
No alcohol or opium (Nope), he sober like some polar skin
He focused, 'cause he ain't think rap could take him to this podium (Yeah)
Livin' every day to the fullest, but move in silence
So romanticize your life, 'cause tomorrow ain't pinky promised

Bitch, I'm fishtailin', yeah
I ain't think rap could take me this far, for real
Changin' niggas lives
I took my mom to Roscoes, early on
And I was like "Listen, you never have to work again in your motherfuckin' life"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
I kept that promise

Who would've ever thunk it?
I mean, did you see we was gon' make it this far?

// EVERYTHING MUST GO //

Got slave whip money, can't choose which one
Might go chip somethin', can't choose which gun
Don't do no cuffin', gone when night come
No, you can't be my girl, bitch, are you dumb? (Are you dumb?)
Never gave a fuck about where a nigga from
Chopper in the trunk with a hunnid in the drum
Mob a nigga up, then I'm headed to Milan
Gotta catch a flight to catch me slippin', you're a bum

Run it up, run it up, no, them niggas not with us (Niggas not with me)
She got freckles, I got cookies, tell them bitches, "Come with us"
Got that house on the hill, it lean like a double cup
Clean like my stubble cut (Nah)

Leather hot in here, shit make Nelly sing songs
Big pearls on the belt make my belly seem swole
I'm watchin' Queen Gambit, lookin' like an extra
Different color chess pieces hangin' from my necklace (Bleh)
Stones too heavy, give me red neck, Texas
I cover it with scarves in my closet like my exes
Fiat 151, bitch, this ain't a Lexus
Third gear got me drivin' like I got a death wish
Small Italian town, hittin' wheelies on a Vespa
Stamps on my passport is longer than a lecture (Y'all ready?)
Handshake from God and some explainable etceteras
Is what the fuck you gon' need if you tryna catch up
Nigga, I'm a big dog, Bunnyhop, big leaps
Big frog reach, guaranteein' that you're leavin' in a stretcher, nigga

On the left side, I'll show you how to stunt
On the right side, I'll show you how to stunt, nigga (You niggas ain't stuntin')

Niggas wanna join us 'cause they can't beat us
In the motorcade, playin' follow the leader

Back the fuck up off me, dawg (Talkin' million dollar payments)

Got the same old watch, y'all fuck the same old bitches (I'm pretentious)
Y'all buy the same old cars, y'all take the same old pictures (Stupid, y'all niggas regular)
Make the same old threats, tell the same old business
See, y'all the gay ones, y'all do it to impress those niggas
But I'ma mind my business like it's explosives gettin' tossed (Y'all niggas gay)
Y'all can keep y'all fingers crossed, Call Me When You Get Lost, bitch

// WHAT A DAY //

What a day at the park
The Estate Sale
What a day at the park
Gangsta Grillz

I pulled up in that eighteenth letter repeat buggy
Had to switch the hue 'cause them LA boys smuggy
But more likely to get hurt by somebody who love me
My lady, she don't trust me, know I'm a sick puppy
Know that women throw themselves at me and men want me
Anything could happen for attention and rent money
I got so much on my plate, that's why I sit funny
So many hand-outs, so much back bending
So much entitlement my family be acting in
So many white diamonds, yeah, I got jungle fever
But they didn't raise me, so shout out black women
So much commenting, show me what you good at
Tell me the highs of the valley that your boots stood at
You couldn't fit in my loafers if you took a steroid
And I wouldn't handle your baggage if I had a bell boy
I'm rarely replying to texts, barely enjoying the sex
I got a pain in my chest, that's from suppressing the stress
Lionel, he know me the best
Told me I know the answer, but Clancy, he gave me the best advice that I heard in a sec'
I need to call me a jet, I need to pack me a bag
I need to get me a cabin, need some scrimmage in chess
I could've bought me some land, I went and flooded my neck
I say this shit with my chest, I am like one of the best (Greatest)
I am a workaholic and I need to get me some rest
I'd rather get these ideas off, I'd rather not steer off my path
I'm so scared of going back to my past
I work, I swear it's hard not shaking that fear off
White boy said I brag too much, the black kid said it's inspiring
Duality is tiring, my girl would kill me if she knew the things I was desiring
Suppressing it, get it out the way, I put the sirens in, yeah

What a day at the park
What a day at the park
What a day

Look, I don't fuck with parties, I don't fuck with the paparazzi
Never have I drove a Hellcat or a Maserati
Never needed others for my personal validation
She ain't getting touched if she cannot hold a conversation
Never had a bulky Richard Mille as a wristwatch
I never seen Amiri, never posted on TikTok
I never had desire for promethazine in a soda
Never made eye contact with a woman in Fashion Nova
Never had to fit in no lane
Never wore Beats By Dre headphones to get a video made, uh
Bunnyhop validated, pedaling
Hitting wheelies like Chris retaliated, just look around
Every opportunity allocated
I put so many niggas on, you thought DJ Khaled made it
From cold showers, I used to hate it
Now I'm spending fifteen for the new roof, it ain't renovated
I could see the ocean where I sleep and the house is gated
No Calabasas, I Brentwood it or Palisade it
The freckled girls articulating art got me salivating (I love it)
Wall is Henry Taylor with the trunks, I be playing Jenga
The last tour, dog, I cleaned house
They mad I made it, I'm so conceited
Feeling myself, ego masturbating, I graduated
After album five, I got syndicated, you want the old T?
Sorry G, that picture faded
Come get with me

What a day at the park (I like to call that)
What a day at the park (Oh my God)

Yeah
I'm a dead poet (Poet), tabletop stumping (Stumping)
I'm a free spirit, have the whole jail jumping (Jumping)
Ever since a youngin', moved at my pace (At my own)
Scared of having youngins 'cause I like my space (Yeah)
Selfish ain't the word (Nope), regret ain't either (Nuh-uh)
Before you get the huffing and the puffing, take a breather (Hah-hah-hah)
Put yourself first if you're living with a dream (Put yourself first)
Be your biggest cheerleader, motherfuck the team
One

// WHARF TALK //

Some here with you right now

If you got cold feet, it's warm by the water
You can turn your page around, let me be the author
Don't leave your destiny by the harbor

Them bitches say I'm too conceited, they see the way I treat her
Be my señorita, put a ring up on her finger
Take her out the climate, somewhere to put her feet up
Neck Valentinin', rubies, diamonds, uh
Billionaire yacht party, climate was hot
Baby, if you seasick, we could stop on the dock

// DOGTOOTH //

She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return
Her body count and who she fuck ain't never my concern (I think it's weird)
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house (We back at it, dogtooth, yuh, dogtooth, yuh)

She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return
Except for some her time and all her love, that's my concern
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house and turn it to a yard
If you don't know my grandma name, then we ain't really dogs, bitch

I shook your hand, I don't respect
Don't call me king, I'm not your twin
I'm not your brother, we just met
See, I won't purchase (Her) no Birkin (Uh)
Got hobbies (Uh), got purpose (Woo)
Got thumpers, I'm perfect (Uh)
Yeah, kelly green wagon look better when the gloom out
Canary shine brighter in the dark, I brought the moon out
The plane fly better when it's just me and the pilot
Tuition for the mileage, it's worth it for the silence
There he go, he cast broads like radio
Shit, your lady knows, it's young T like baby clothes
And I got that fire, and I got good dick
Guap long, dick long, plus I look good, bitch (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return (Woo)
Because if she get off, then I get off, that's my concern (Uh-huh, ah, man)
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house and turn it to a yard (Yeah, yeah, turn up that shit)
If you don't know my grandma name, then we ain't really dogs, bitch

That's a lot of mothafuckin' necklace
Five, six, seven is the figure for a setlist (Yeah)
Ring, ring, ring, bitch, pick up the phone
I don't care if y'all together, I will tear down a home, shit
I shimmy through Paris in back of phantom of the threads
The driver's seat of the Enzo could barely fit my legs
And Virgil my chaperone, he look out from overhead (Love you, V)
Not sure what you overheard but it's prolly what I said, bitch
I'm out here livin', y'all on the feed (Yuck)
My girl look like Zazie Beetz and Kelis (Yuck)
I pull up in the "What the fuck is that, dawg?" (Vroom, vroom, vroom, I said, "Yuck")
It's Mr. Peculiar, that's who I be, who I be
Niggas tellin' women how they bodies supposed to be
But never take advice from any nigga with a lean gut (Fuck these niggas)
Keep your chair rockin' and my two cents in your pocket
Your only option, I don't play no mothafuckin' games

She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return (in return, turn)
And will I ever fall in love again? I can't confirm
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house and turn it to a yard
If you don't know my daughter name, then we ain't really dogs

After this
You niggas can't say nothin' (Dogtooth, dogtooth)

// HEAVEN TO ME //

My energy kinetic
The fitted hat by Ebbots
(Yessir)
(DJ Drama) Yeah

I like sugar, I like sweets
I don't like the spicy eats
I need bridges in my beats
And Campana Brothers seats
The heaven part for me is knowing I can wake up when I'm finished with my sleep
Ain't no kids to feed
No stress, I bleed
I don't got a boss
I go wherever and don't care 'bout the cost (Nah)
Gas money was stark for me
Now I got so many cars, I can start up
We nappin' in parks
We in the sun gettin' darked up
Chillin' with my suit on
Travel trunk is either Moynat leather or it's Vuitton
Sippin' mint tea like we know the tree the leaf fell from
We come from them tiki punch drinks
Had annomiosty for dinner, El Pollo Loco
That was in the past, now I'm parmesan my bolognese
Half a million driftin' and the tire reading "Toyo"
Prefer the aligator logo on my on my cotton polo
Living it up, my niggas is up
Y'all niggas is salty peanuts, we ain't givin' a fuck
'Cause I'm blessed as Hell and I ain't next to jail
Ain't got no psycho hiccups
Plus I dress this well
My heaven 24/7

That's heaven (Heaven only knows)
That's heaven to me, yeah
What's heaven to you? Yeah
That's heaven to me, yeah
What's heaven to you? To y'all
Because that's heaven to me, aw-aw
(You gotta love it)

The lake water gettin' warmer from the radiant sun
My baby mama and my daughter gettin' chased by my son
The water gun is in his arms, that lil' nigga could run
He get it from his daddy side, you know, them Nigerians
My mama pulled up in a helicopter
Sister in the kitchen, kickin' Jackson, mixin' vodka
After dinner, I'll convince them they should babysit 'em
Me and wifey gettin' ready to go see an opera (Sydney)
This the house we come to when we got nothing to do
The big yard, quaint size with the immaculate view
My boat got a yacht with a slide on the side
My son and I got some bikes we could ride
I'll show him how to wheelie
And Wally hit my cell, we cleared another dealy
It's no contingency, the number's in the hundred milly's
I'm in my fourties lookin' twenty-somethin' (Yeah)
I don't ask for nothin' (Nothin')
Everything is mwah
That's heaven for a God
My health is on a hundred
You feel me?

(Skin glowin') That's heaven to me, yeah
What's heaven to you?
That's really heaven at forty, like, havin' good health
What's heaven to you? To y'all?
Because that's heaven
This-this was heaven
This was heaven at like, as a kid

It used to be the 'preme hat in the green
The cheetah print on the tee
The dark wash in the jean
Soccer mom with the Vans in every color it seems
Kids push down the block
Cuttin' dickies into shorts when it's hot
Fuckin' Wendys up
Brainstorming ways to get our pennies up
Me and Jasper spending last bucks on the city bus
Wayne tapes and Vice mags and Portishead drops
Pegleg, Ice Cream shoes, the Mr. Krabs watch
That was heaven for me
'Round time seventeen
Eggin' niggas houses, fuckin' girls from Pasadena
Bastard wasn't finished, I was forming up a team
I didn't have much but for certain I had a dream
[*gibberish*]
I fuck the flow up, fuck it, I bring it back like the hairline was receding
[*gibberish*]

Don't let your neighbors take you to Hell
Introduce them to heaven
Heaven only knows

Sorry to the guys I had to hide (Ooh)
Sorry to the girls I had to lie to
Who ain't need to know if I was by the lake switchin' tides, too (Tides)
Anyway, I don't wanna talk (Ooh)
Sorry if you gotta dig for info I don't wanna give
So you stalk, make up fibs, just to talk about my private life 'cause you're weird (Uh)
Met that girl this year (But), that's none ya biz
Give enough with my art, know your place
My personal space, y'all don't need to to be a part
I'm sorry I don't wanna link and small talk over dinner
I don't even drink, can't guilt trip me, I'm ice cold, roller rink
Nigga-nigga-nigga, read the room
Don't assume niggas is cool

Sorry I'm not empathetic (Nah, I'm fuckin')
Sorry you think I'm pathetic
Sorry I don't wanna bro down
Sorry I don't know your pronouns

Sorry, Mother Earth
Polluted air with chemicals and dirt
These cars ain't gonna buy and drive themselves
What the hell you think I work for?
Not to not explore and stay the same (I'm)
Sorry to the fans who say I changed, 'cause I did
Sorry you don't know me on a personal level to pinpoint what it is
I'm sorry to my ancestors (I'm so sorry), I know I'm supposed to fight (I know)

In the meantime, I'll give some advice while these blood diamonds gettin' cleaned off

Fuck the numbers, fuck a hook
You put me on a stage and I'll show you the difference
Let me see y'all hit a stage (No, y'all can't do it)
Let me see y'all write a page (Y'all not gon' do it)
Let me see you make a decision I made
And claim that I don't know about minimum wage or Section 8
Water in the ketchup bottle to stretch when niggas ate
Gettin' pressed by niggas hoppin' gates
Thinkin' it's normal 'cause you ain't supposed to make it past eighteen or escape the Figure 8 cycle
And I promise this is like a diet, I'ma make a way and I did, did
Feel good, work paid off, now we gon' celebrate
But niggas claim you arrogant when they can't relate to moments of feelin' great
So they aim, duck-duck-duck 'em
Shot right back, buck-buck-buck 'em
Sorry, not sorry (Buck 'em, buck 'em)
I got two words, fuck 'em

Okay, cool
And like that
We really mean it this time
I guarantee another era is upon us
So once again, we gone
