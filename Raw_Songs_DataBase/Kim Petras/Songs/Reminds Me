I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you

I'm stuck, fucked up, fuck love
I'm off, can't sleep, can't think
Because my heart is broke
You left me cold, you left the pain
You took my soul, damn

But I don't wanna cry
Got my finger on the trigger
Man, I'm thinking 'bout a homicide
I feel like I can die
Maybe if it was all over
I could have you in another life

I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you

Cut off my bitches, yeah, won't return no calls, yeah
If I woulda listened, we would still be on, yeah
One of my exes came to break me off, yeah
I mean to fuck, but I ain't nut at all, no
Whole time you were on my mind, baby
I swear you got me fuckin' love-crazy
Remember when I said nothing phased me
Well that was till I lost my baby, yeah

But I don't wanna cry
Got my finger on the trigger
Man, I'm thinking 'bout a homicide
I feel like I can die
Maybe if it was all over
I could have you in another life

(Reminds me of you)
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you
