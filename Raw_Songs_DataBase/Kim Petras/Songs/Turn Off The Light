Midnight
Under moonlight
Chills down your spine
Fear in your eyes
Feelin' malicious
Heard you like it vicious
All your dirty wishes
We were made to do it

C'mon, are you curious enough to taste it?
To taste it

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Hot stuff
Know you like it rough
When I put it on ya, you'll never get enough
Feelin' the pressure
The pain turns into pleasure
Ooh, I'm gonna get ya
Ooh, I'm gonna get ya

C'mon, are you curious enough to taste it?
To taste it

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh


Only in the darkness will you find your true self
Howl at the moon to awaken the spell
One cannot judge what the eye cannot see
Outside the realm of humanity
Embrace your fear, don't dare to run
Only then will you be what you're meant to become


If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
