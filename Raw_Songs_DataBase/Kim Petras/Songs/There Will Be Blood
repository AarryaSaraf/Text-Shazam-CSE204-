There will be blood
Run for your life
Go on and say, go on and say your last goodbye
There will be blood
You're gonna die
You'll never make it, never make it through the night
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood, blood

(There will be)
In the club, I can't save you now
Ain't nobody can hear you shout
When I'm pulling you underground
(There will be)
Take a sip from the devil's cup
Just a taste, you won't get enough
Seal your fate when you swallow up

(There will be)
Don't let me in, I'ma ruin your life
I'm straight psychotic
(There will be)
This is gonna be a hell of a night
I know you want it

There will be blood
Run for your life
Go on and say, Go on and say your last goodbye
There will be blood
You're gonna die
You'll never make it, never make it through the night
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
(There will be blood)

(There will be)
When you're begging and on your knees
That's when I get a sweet release
You can't run from your destiny
(There will be)
I've been dying to feel alive
And your pain is my paradise
So tonight you gon' pay the price

(There will be)
Don't let me in, I'ma ruin your life
I'm straight psychotic
(There will be)
This is gonna be a hell of a night
I know you want it

There will be blood
Run for your life
Go on and say, Go on and say your last goodbye
There will be blood
You're gonna die (You're gonna die)
You'll never make it, never make it through the night
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood, blood
(There will be)
