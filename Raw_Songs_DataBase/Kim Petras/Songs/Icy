Never loved nobody harder
Never, ever felt stronger
Thought that we would last forever

Gave me something to believe in
Thought that you were all I needed
Look at me, I'm still breathing

I used to cry over you, baby
I've wasted all this time

Now I got a ice-cold heart
VVS's's the only kinda ice I want
Kinda funny how the money can't replace the love
So numb, I don't feel it inside me
So dumb, I believed you really liked me
'Cause of you now my heart is so icy

Now I'm on a higher level
I ain't ever gonna settle
Plenty offers on the table

Baby I don't even hate ya
Really you did me a favor
Turned my heart into a glacier, yeah

I used to cry over you, baby
I've wasted all this time

Now I got a ice-cold heart
VVS's's the only kinda ice I want
Kinda funny how the money can't replace the love
So numb, I don't feel it inside me
So dumb, I believed you really liked me
'Cause of you now my heart is so icy

(Yeah)

Now I got a ice-cold heart
VVS's's the only kinda ice I want
Kinda funny how the money can't replace the love
So numb, I don't feel it inside me
So dumb, I believed you really liked me
'Cause of you now my heart is so icy

'Cause of you now my heart is so icy
So numb, I don't feel it inside me
So dumb, I believed you really liked me
'Cause of you now my heart is so icy
Icy
