If Jesus was a rockstar
Living like a party everyday
And diving off the stage
If you give it to a popstar
That night I'd wanna be just like him
If Jesus was a rockstar
Throwing daddy's money all around
While he was getting down
So they kicked him out of the bar
That night I'd wanna be just like him

Baby all I really need is something to believe
Hell yeah (Hell yeah)
I need someone who can teach me to get on my knees
Hell yeah (Yeah)
But if he look like Kurt Cobain (I might)
If he drank the pain away (I might)
And if you think I can't be saved (that's right)
I really really want you to know that

If Jesus was a rockstar
Living like a party everyday
And diving off the stage
If you give it to a popstar
That night I'd wanna be just like him
If Jesus was a rockstar
Throwing daddy's money all around
While he was getting down
So they kicked him out of the bar
That night I'd wanna be just like him
I might meet him in the bathroom
Hell yeah (Hell yeah)
We might pop one, a red or blue
Hell yeah
But if he look like Kurt Cobain (I might)
If he drank the pain away (I might)
And if you think I can't be saved (that's right)
I really really want you to know that

If Jesus was a rockstar
Living like a party everyday
And diving off the stage
If you give it to a popstar
That night I'd wanna be just like him
If Jesus was a rockstar
Throwing daddy's money all around
While he was getting down
So they kicked him out of the bar
That night I'd wanna be just like him

(A rockstar)
Just like him
(A rockstar)
