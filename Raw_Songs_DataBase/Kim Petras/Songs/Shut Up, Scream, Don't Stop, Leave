(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)
(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)
(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)
(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)

I, I'm so tired of sitting in the backseat
I wanna drive, I wanna drive
I, I want control, I want it all, yeah
I decide to side, decide to side

I'm in the proposition, that means that I'm on top
So when I talk, you listen, no, don't you dig it up
I want you on all fours, I got a Gaultier leash
I got a red Ferrari, I'm all alone and naughty
I live up in the mountains, that's where they keep the freaks
I need a Michelangelo, I'm like a God in Greece

Don't come to my place
Unless you're ready
Turn around, babe, turn around, babe
Don't come up late
Unless you're ready to meet your faith, to meet your faith

(Shut up) Do as I say, do as I say
(Scream) Do it my way, do it my way
(Don't stop) Do as I say, do as I say
(Leave) Do it my way, do it my way
(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)
(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)
(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)
(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)
