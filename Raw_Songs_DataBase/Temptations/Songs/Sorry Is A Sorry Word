Remember me the one who heard your cries
And reached out and dried your eyes

Remember me the one who found you and wrapped all my love around you
When you were all alone and your dreams were all gone
When you were nothing but a tear stained face I did feel for you
Girl your broken wing is mended and your need for me has ended
Girl you say you must be free
You wanna fly away from me
You were lost and your yesterday is my tomorrow
And now you say you must be free, baby

Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true

Out of sympathy and all you feel for me
After all the sweet love I've given to you (given you baby)
Girl you walk away with the best part of me
The love I gave to you to give it to someone new
And sorry won't ease the feeling.

Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true
