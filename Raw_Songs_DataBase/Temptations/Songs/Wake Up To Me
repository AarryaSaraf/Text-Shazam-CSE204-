Oh how nice it would be
To have you wake up, close to me
Be the first thing I see
In the morning

Just to reach out and feel
You are here, you are real
Not just a dream, not a dream, oh a dream
I've been dreaming

Wake up to me
Wake up to me

We've been in love, much too long
This love we feel is much too strong
For night to find us all alone
In separate places

Oh to reach out and feel
To have you close, to have you near
To warm each night
Until the morning

Wake up to me
Wake up to me
