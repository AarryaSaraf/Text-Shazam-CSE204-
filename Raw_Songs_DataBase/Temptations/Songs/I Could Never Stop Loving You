I thought that I could live without your love
But it seems as though I never get enough
Since that first night you laid back in my arms
I haven't been the same, yeah
Guess I got you in my blood
Can't explain
The pleasure you give me (pleasure you give me)
No one can make do that

I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you
I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you

I need your love for more than just a night
Don't you know by now that I'm here for the rest of my life
No matter how many nights I choose to roam
You can rest assure girl that I'll be coming home to you
I can't afford to lose you (can't afford to lose you)
So glad I got to choose you (glad I got to choose you)
For my wife

I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you
I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you

A lot of love this night

I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you
I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you

I tried but I can't
I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you
I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you
I tried but I can't
But I can't stop loving you
