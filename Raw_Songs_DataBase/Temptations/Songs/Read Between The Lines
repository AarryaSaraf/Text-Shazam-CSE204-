No I'll never leave you
No I'll never leave you
No I'll never leave you
I ain't going nowhere

It's time that we had a little talk together
Something's going on when I'm away from you
Honey, now when we kiss (now when we kiss)
There's something that I miss
Where's that loving touch that I used to love so much
Now we've together for so long (for so long)
I can read you like a book (like a book)
You're acting strange
I can't stand the pain
Are you too far gone to change

If you can read between the lines
(You just might find)
Read between the lines
Never going to leave you

Read between the lines
You never know what you might find
That I'm never going to leave you
Never going to leave you

Now I might have been gone every now
And then neglected you (neglected you)
And put you through so many changes
I was trying to pursue a better life for me and you
But misery loves company, come on understand
That I'm just a man trying to do
The very very best I can (best I can)
But what's the use if you're running loose
You only get out what you put in

If you can read between the lines
(You just might find)
Read between the lines
That I'm never going to leave you
Never going to leave you

Read between the lines
You never know what you might find
That I'm never going to leave you
Never going to leave you

Read between the lines
You never know what you might find
That I'm never going to leave you
Never going to leave you
