Oh the weather outside is frightful
but the fire is so delightful
and since we've no place to go
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
and it doesnt show signs of stopping
and i've brought some corn for popping
the lights are turned way down low
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
when we finally kiss goodnight
how i'll hate going out in the storm
but if you really hold me tight
all the way home i'll be warm
and the fire is slowly dieing
and my dear is still goodbyeing
but as long as you love me so
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Instrumental]

and the fire is slowly dieing
and my dear is still goodbyeing
but as long as you love me so
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
let it snow
