I ain't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
At what makes a birdie fly

I don't have time to think about
What makes a flower grow
And I never given a thought
To where rivers flow

(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh yeah
Ain't got time for nothing else

I ain't got time to discuss the weather
Or how long it's gonna last
And I ain't got time to do no studying
Once I get out of class

And I'm just a fella
With a one, a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just dont have time

(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh yeah
Ain't got time for nothing else
And I know it's all, it's alright

I ain't got time to read a newspaper
Or look at TV
And I'm not concerned with what the future holds
In store for me

I'm just a fella
With a one, a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just dont have time

(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh yeah
Ain't got time for nothing else
You know I'm too, too busy
(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh baby
Ain't got time for nothing else
