You've got a smile so bright, you know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight, you know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet, you know you could have been a broom
The way you smell so sweet, you know you could have been some perfume


Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are, you know you could have been a flower
If good looks was a minute, you know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart, you know you could have been a cool crook
And baby you're so smart, you know you could have been a schoolbook



You made my heart so rich, you know you could have been some money
And baby you're so sweet, you know you could have been some honey



You really swept me off my feet, you made my life complete
You made my life so bright, you make me feel alright
