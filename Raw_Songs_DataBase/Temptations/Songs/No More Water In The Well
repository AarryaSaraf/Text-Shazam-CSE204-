No more water in the well, no more.
No more water in the well, no more.
You take my love for granted
like water, water you spill and you waste.
Though love is thicker than water
it spills quicker than water
and you'll lookup one of these days,
and there'll be no more water in the well.
How long do you think my love can last
through sorrow pain and mistrust?
Today my love is strong,
but keep doing me wrong
and tomorrow it may turn to dust.
