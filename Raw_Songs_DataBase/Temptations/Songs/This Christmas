Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better this Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together this Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright
And we're carolin' through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for you and me

Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better this Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together this Christmas

Fireside blazing bright
And we're carolin' through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me

Shake a hand, shake a hand now

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you this Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do this Christmas

Fireside blazing bright
And we're carolin' through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me

Shake a hand, shake a hand now
It's alright, oh baby, we're gonna do it
This Christmas
Hey, baby, baby, we're gonna do it, oh yeah
This Christmas

Fireside blazing bright
And we're carolin' through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me
Shake a hand, shake a hand

Baby, fireside blazing bright
Girl, everything is gonna be
Gonna be bright and nice
