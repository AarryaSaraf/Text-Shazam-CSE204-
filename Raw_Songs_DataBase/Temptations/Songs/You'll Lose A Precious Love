One day, you will begin to realize
By the look that's in my eyes

How much I love you (love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

Somehow, these arms of mine can't let you go
The touch of my hand, baby, should let you, let you know

How much I love you (love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

We go together like hand and glove
 Don't destroy our precious love

Somehow these arms of mine can't let you go
The touch of my hand should let you know

How much I love you (love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)
