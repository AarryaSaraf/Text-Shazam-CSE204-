Well, boy and girls, it's Christmas time again.

So, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's makin' a list
And checkin' it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So, be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now, listen, he sees when you're sleeping,
And he knows when you're awake.
He knows if you've beed bad or good
So, be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Little tin horns
And little toy drums
A rooty-toot-toot
And a rumpa-bum-bum
Santa Claus is comin' to town

So, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Ooh
