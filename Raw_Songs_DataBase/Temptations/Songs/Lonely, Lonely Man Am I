Lonely, I'm so lonely
Lonely, I'm so lonely

Lonely, lonely man am I
As I sit here in my lonely room
People now, nothing seems the same since you said to me we're all through
Now, my telephone never rings anymore
And no one ever knocks on my door
Lonely, lonely man am I

Now people, sometimes I sit and I stare at her picture all day long
Wondering how could a woman that I treated so good just do me so wrong
Now, no sense in me denying
Ever since she's been gone I've been crying
Lonely, lonely man am I

Now I, haven't been able to be all right
She said to me to try to sleep at night
Everywhere I look, our picture lies a-face
I'm just a lonely man with a tear-stained face
Lonely, lonely man am I

I'm so lonely, so lonely (lonely, lonely)
I'm so lonely, lonely
I'm so lonely, so lonely (lonely, lonely)
