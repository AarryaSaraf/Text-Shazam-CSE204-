I know you're pleased with all the presents
That you found lying under the tree
I can tell it brought some gladness to your heart
But on this yuletide holiday
Would you pause and give a little thought to me
And we can share the most important gift of all

Cause we know Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year

I know the wine, roasting holly
Will grace the table with all the trimmings on that day
As we wish each other's families peace and joy
And mistletoe and all it's splendor
May be seen hanging from each welcome door
But we feel the same way we felt the day before

Cause we know Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year

It's a happy time whether rain, snow, or sunshine
The world is slow, it's cold, we celebrate
With kisses warm, I'll give you one for every season
And renew the vows we made our wedding day

So let the bells bring down the children
Leave the beds with the coming of the dawn
To see that Santa kept his promise and came to call
While we both watch them in satisfaction
When we have each other Summer, Spring or Fall

We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
