One drag, that's all it took
One drag, that's all it took

Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find
Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find, yeah

People I got sunshine on a cloudy day, ya
I got sunshine, sunshine on a cloudy day, have mercy
People I'm grooving, groovin' me and myself, dig?
I'm just groovin', groovin' me and myself, oh Lord, have mercy

Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find, hmm
Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find, yeah, just me

Callin' on the group to give me a little whoop, whoop
Callin' on the group to give me a little whoop, whoop
Whoop, whoop, yeah, whoop, whoop, whoop, yeah, whoop
Whoop, whoop, yeah, whoop, hmm, hmm

Take out your crayon and coloring book
And color me out

My mind sleeping but I'm wide awake
My mind sleeping but I'm wide awake
One drag, that's all it took

Welcome to the circle, ya, we'll decide, you dig?
'Cause you people look at us like we're freaks
Ding, dong, dang, ain't no thang baby

There is no young, there is no old
Reach and touch your soul

Tell me, have you ever been off the ground
For a long, nice and slow? Here we go

Seems like every Monday morning I've got the blues
And every Tuesday, I get some bad news
Wednesday worse 'cause I ain't got a dime to my name
I done worked so hard all week

Thursday, my body just racked with pain
Here come the good part
Friday the eagle flies and so do I
I wonder if you hear me when I say
The eagle flies on Friday and so do I, yeah, just listen

Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find
Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find, yeah
