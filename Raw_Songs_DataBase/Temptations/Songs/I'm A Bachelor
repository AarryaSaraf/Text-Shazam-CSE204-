I'm a bachelor...It's not by choice
I'm a bachelor - I've got to speak my voice

Listen here...

I've been a lot of places in my lifetime
I've had a lot of women that I thought was mine - many times
There's not many things in life that I won't do - naw
But I'm still a lonely man, and I've got to tell you

That I'm a bachelor...It's not by choice
I'm a bachelor - I've got to speak my voice

Well...

I really want a girl I can bring my money to - yes I do
And do all the things that the sweet thing wants me to - yeah
But I'm not rushing, I'm taking it one step at a time
Cause when I find that girl, she'll know that she's mine

Until I do, I'm a bachelor...It's not by choice - naw
I'm a bachelor - I've got to speak my voice
(I want bachelors all over the world to say it with me)
I'm a bachelor (I'm a bachelor)...It's not by choice - Say it again
I'm a bachelor (I'm a bachelor) - I've got to speak my voice - yeah

Don't want nobody to feel sorry for me - naw
I ain't askin' for no charity
Ain't got but one goal, just one goal in life
I wanna be happy, and find myself a wife

Until I do, I'm a bachelor (I'm a bachelor)...But not by choice - naw
(I'm) I'm a bachelor (I'm a bachelor) - I've got to speak my voice

Sometimes it makes me wanna...

Woo eww eww, (well) dih dih dih dihhh
Woo eww eww, I can't help myself
Woo eww eww, dih dih dih dihhh
Woo eww eww

I'm a bachelor

All of you married men
I envy you (yes I do, yes I do)
I wish I was married too - yes I do

All of you married men
I envy you (yes I do, yes I do)
I wish I was married too - yes I do

Heyyy

Woo eww eww, dih dih dih dihhh
Woo eww eww, dih dih dih dihhh
