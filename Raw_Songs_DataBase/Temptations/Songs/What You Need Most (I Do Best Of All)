Darling, my darling, my darling
I want to please you
Darling, my darling, my darling
I want to please you, oh!

I watch everything you say and do
And that's because I'm interested in you, oh
You may think that I pay you no mind
But I can see the hurt there in your eyes

How long can you keep on hiding
Wearing a smile that is upside down
You just look over your shoulder
I'll be around, oh!

What you need most, I do best of all
You need love and it shows
You don't fool me at all

When your at home all by yourself
I bet you play games with yourself, (oh, why, why, why)
Like setting a table for two
Knowing that there be only just you

Life don't have to be that way
Once you realize what you need
And what you need now, darling, it just be, oh!

What you need most, I do best of all
Honey, you need love and shows
You don't fool me at all

Here I am, here I am with open arms, dear
Like your shadow, I've always been near
For I know just what you been through
'Cause I've walked that same road too

So, just make up your mind
What you're looking for ain't hard to find

What you need
I do best of all
Honey, you need love and it shows
You don't fool me at all

What you need most (what'cha need girl, what'cha need girl)
I do best of all (what'cha need, what'cha need, what'cha need girl)
You need love and it shows (what'cha need girl, what'cha need girl)
You don't fool me at all (what'cha need, what'cha need, what'cha need girl)

Ooh! (darling, my darling, my darling, best of all)
La la la la la la la la la la la la la...
Yeah! Baby! (darling, my darling, my darling, best of all)
I know what'cha need and I'm right here to give it to you
Take my hand!
