After many tears fall from your eyes
A thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed, oh yeah
You're left alone and brokenhearted
Love just comes and goes
How long it's gonna last nobody knows, oh oh

That's the way love is, baby
That's the way love is

I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road, girl
And your heart's carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
And your whole world's cavin' in
Listen to me, now's the time to be strong
You've gotta forget him, woo-hoo, now that he's gone
Remember...

That's the way love is, baby
That's the way love is

Let me run somethin' down to you, baby
Love can be a hurting thing
And it can be as warm as a person's scream
When love is present, everything is alright
But when it's gone you toss and turn all night

The road of love is rough sometimes
Don't let it get the best of you
Said I've been hurt by love so many times
So I know just what you're goin' through
I bet you wish that you were never born
You've got to forget him, ooh, now that he's gone
Remember...

That's the way love is, baby
That's the way love is, ooh

Love is here today, gone tomorrow
All your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is)
Ooh, one day gladness, the next day sadness
That's the way love is, sho'nuff, how it is
(That's the way love is)
Love just comes and goes
How long it's gonna last, nobody knows
