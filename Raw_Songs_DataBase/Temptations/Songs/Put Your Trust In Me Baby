Once upon a time
You filled my life and now you're gone
But life will go on
I find myself still holding on

To a dream that you'll come back
I can't accept that you have gone
(Whichever way I turn)
I still see you in my mind

I can't stand (I can't stand it)
Being all alone (I can't stand it)
You're my chosen one (I can't stand it)
Can't you see what you've done
You got my heart on the run

Oh baby, can't you see?
You can put your trust in me
I know that (I know, I know)
You'll find that hard to believe

When (when will I learn?)
That wanting love won't make love mine
Your love I've tried to earn
And though I've failed my heart still yearns
This emptiness my heart can't stand (baby)
Without your love, I'm half a man 'cause

(In bed) I toss and I turn
'Cause I need you in the night!

(Put your trust in me baby!)
Baby, baby!
(Put your trust in me baby)
I can't stand being alone!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Girl, I want you for my own!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Put your trust in me baby!

I can't stand being all alone
You're my chosen one
Can't you see what you've done
You got my heart on the one for you, baby
(Baby, can't you see?)
You can put all your trust in me (I got to say that)
I know (I know! I know!)
You'll find that hard to believe!

Baby! Baby!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Without you baby I can't go on!
(Put your trust in me baby)
I'll hold on to your love!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Put your trust in me baby!
(Put your trust in me)

Little girl, what am I gonna do?
I've realized I don't have you
(Do, do, doo)
You are the girl that can make my life
You're the girl I want to make my wife
Put your trust in me baby!
Put your trust in me baby!
There ain't no limit to the things I wouldn't do
Trust in me like I trust in you!

(Put your trust in me baby)
I'm begging you baby!
(Put your trust in me baby)
I'm down on my bended knees!
(Put your trust in me baby)
