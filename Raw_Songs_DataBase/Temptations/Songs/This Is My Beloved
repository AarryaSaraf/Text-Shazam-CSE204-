This is my beloved, this is my beloved
Ooh when I get weary and my way gets dim
And I look all around and see my chances are slim
She give me courage to go on

This is my beloved, this is my beloved
When I lay awake in the middle of the night
And all my dreams have faded way out of sight
I hear her sweet voice in the dark

This is my beloved, this is my beloved
She never puts anothing before me
She knows me like a book from A to Z
She can make me laugh, have fun and be free
But most of all she know when to just let me be

This is my beloved, this is my beloved
When my pride is gone and I feel half a man
And everything goes wrong though I do the best I can
She makes me feel ten feet tall

This is my beloved and she's so good to me
This is my beloved and I love her, can't you see
This is my beloved and I'll never never let her go
This is my beloved, simply because I love her so...
