It's just a lonely world without you, baby
(A lonely world without you)

When I had your love, I guess I was just too blind to see
How empty life would be without the love you've given to me (oh yeah)
Selfishly, I hurt you, baby; thoughtlessly, I made you cry
Now I'm the one left alone to cry (left to cry)
Since you said goodbye (said goodbye)

It's just a lonely world without you, baby
(A lonely world without you)
So sad (Lonely, lonely world without you)

Now, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, I need you (Baby, I need you)
Really got to have you (Really got to have you)
No good without you (No good without you)
Baby, I know that I'm the blame, and life won't be the same
I'm a lonely man (lonely man) in a lonely room (lonely room)

It'a just a lonely world without you, baby
(Lonely, lonely world without you, oh yeah)

With all my heart and soul, every night I kneel and pray
Find some plan, some schemes for me, I'll get you back one day
Baby, I should have known, I'd miss your loving when you were gone
Now I'm a lonely man (lonely man) in a lonely room (lonely room)

It's just a lonely world without you, baby
(Lonely, lonely, world without you)
Now baby, Whoa baby (Lonely, lonely world without you)

I'm so sad, baby; so lonely, baby
Can't live without you
No good without you, baby
And I'm so lonely
So lonely
