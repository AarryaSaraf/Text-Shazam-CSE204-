It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do

Who to sock it to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do

And if you want me to love you, maybe I will
I need you woman, it ain't no big deal
You need lovin' just as bad as I do, now
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do

Who to sock it to

It's your thing, girl (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
Don't let me tell ya
Who to sock it to

So, it's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to
Hit me band

So, it's your thing girl (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
No doubt about it
Who I'm gonna sock it to
