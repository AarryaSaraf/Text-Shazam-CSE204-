Like a marathon, that's keeping on
I'm running
Trying to catch you
You 20th century girl
Live inside your force
Steady on your course
Let me trip into your star war world
Mystic woman, slow down for me

Love me over, love me over
Mystic woman
Such a righteous thing
Love me over, love me over
Touch my feelings
Make me feel brand new
Feelings, feelings

When I'm with you
No deja vu in my life
New horizons always will be found
Make me your intentions
Let me move in your dimensions
Then paradise together we are bound

Love me over, love me over
Mystic woman
Such a righteous thing
Love me over, love me over
Touch my feelings
Make me feel brand new
Feelings, feelings

Mystic woman, slow down for me
Love me over, love me over
Mystic woman, such a righteous thing
Love me over, love me over
