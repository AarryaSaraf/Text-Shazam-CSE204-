Your eyes tell a story, such a sad story
Of the things you feel inside
Of the things you cannot hide
My friend I see trouble in your eyes

There ain't no justice
In that picture that you're painting of me in your mind
Ain't no justice 'cause that face ain't mine
There ain't no justice

Build your walls
Craw into your holes
Put out your signs
Peep through your blinds
Call me, "your kind"
I don't mind
There ain't no justice
Why can't we live our lives and be friends?
In that picture that you're painting of me in your mind
Ain't no justice 'cause that face ain't mine
There ain't no justice

Close your eyes, I want you to take an imaginary trip with me
Tomorrow!

Listen to the sound of the children playing
Their young happy hearts laughing and saying
"I care not about the color of my friend,"
"I only know I'm having fun with him."
Black, white, yellow, green or blue
What does color really mean?
Yet it keeps you and I from seeing eye to eye
If nothing else let us learn from the kids
Once again, happiness

There ain't no justice when you don't trust us!
