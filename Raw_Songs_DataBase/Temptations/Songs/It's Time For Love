It's time for love (it's time for love)
Open your arms and make a friend
You might need him in the end
All you got to do is take somebody's hand
We need peace and love today
We need love right away

They said there's a sex revolution going on, going strong
But that's not what we're talking about
We need to find the solution to jealousy, bigotry, enemies
Oh, it's time to enforce the plan
Make the rich share the fat of the land
All the killing and war must cease
What we all should be shooting for is peace

It's time for love
We need some loving right away
Open your arms and make a friend
You might need him in the end
It's time for love
Oh, let's lock arms hand in hand
We need peace and love today
We need love right away

There's buildings going up in flames
Hijacked planes, ransom notes
All just breaking down our hopes
Man is god's greatest creation
Don't disrespect the human race or
What gave them life
We got to live together in this world with one another
Oh, we need love so desperately
Love is the key to unity

It's time for love
It's time for love
Open your arms and make a friend
You might need him in the end
It's time for love
We need peace and love today
We need love right away

We need peace and love today (we need it)
We need love right away
Like yesterday

It's time for love (it's time for love)
It's time for love (it's time for love)
Open your arms and make a friend
You might need him in the end
It's time for love
All you got to do is take somebody's hand
We need peace and love today
We need love right away

It's time for love
It's time for love
It's time for love
It's time for love
Show love, oh love
It's time for love
It's time for love
It's time for love
It's time for love
We got to live together to make the world a better place
Loving and praying for one another will
Help the human race
Care about peace
And share with one another
We've got to love our enemies just like they're
Our brothers
Oh love, love, love, love
Oh love, love, love, love
It's time for love
It's time for love
It's time for love
We got to help our neighbors
We got to lift a helping hand
We've got to come together
Spread peace all over the land
We got to pray together
Work together
Love together
It's time for love
It's time for love
