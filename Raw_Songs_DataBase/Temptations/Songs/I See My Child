Don't cry, run along
Someday you might understand

I see my child
Standing over there with you
It's a lonely room we're standing in
With a lawyer and judge deciding
The dividing of our lives

Try as I will, I can't explain
Just when the thrill turned into pain

The love I have for your mother
Ain't the same love I have for you, no
Though it seems I don't love her at all
I'll always love your mom thru you
Now go on take Momma's hand, young man
Don't cry run along
Someday you might understand

Grown-ups may change, yes
A child will see one thing remains we're family

The love I have for you son
Is the kind of love that will never stop
Although your Momma might find someone else
You both will stay here in my heart

I see my child
Standing over there with you
It's a lonely room we're standing in
With a lawyer and judge deciding
The dividing of our lives
