I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose
I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose

Hooked on a feeling
I'm on a rocky road
The trip's too heavy
To carry this load

Like a roller coaster
Moves too fast
You got me sinking
I just can't last

Hooked on this feeling
Hooked on this ride
Can't get off this feeling
I just can't step aside

I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose
I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose

You wind me up, take my best
Run me down, when you leave the rest
Like a roller coaster
Moving fast
Like a rocky boat
I'm out of gas

You're flying high, too high for me
I can't hold on, I can't get free

I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose
I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose
