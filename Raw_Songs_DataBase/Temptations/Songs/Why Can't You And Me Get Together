Why can't we get together?
Why can't we get together?
Why can't we get together?
Why can't we get together?

You and me!

Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together?

It seems I see you everywhere I go
At the beach, the show, and even at the disco
But every time I get close to you
You get away, oh, yes you do

So I came to the tennis court
Because I heard that you love the sport
Why can't you?

Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together?
You and me!

Tennis court, I don't know the sport
The game I came to play is of a different sort
But if I have to play to get next to you
I brought a racket and two brand new tennis shoes

See what you made me do for you
Now won't you let me get next to you!

Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together?

Why can't we get together?
Why can't we get together?
Why can't we get together?
You and me!

Now there's a method to my madness
And the crazy way that I come on
You look so good so I, I had to meet ya
Just to let you know where I'm coming from

The tennis court is a funny place to start
I came to let you know you've captured my heart!

Why can't you and me get together? (Right now baby!)
What I want to know is
Why can't you and me get together? (A-right now! A-right now! Now! Now!)
What I want to know is
Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together? (You and me!)

Why can't you, and me, together
Why can't you, and me, together
Why can't you, and me, together...
