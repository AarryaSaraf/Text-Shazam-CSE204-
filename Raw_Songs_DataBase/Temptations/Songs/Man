Awakened by the daylight, man starts his busy day
Eight hours occupy his mind 'cause the bills gotta be paid
Will he take a moment and give thanks before he's on his way?
Everybody wanna go to heaven, don't nobody wanna pray

Man has made everything, this we can't deny
Invisible highways in the sky so safely his iron bird can fly
Hooray for man for he has finally conquered the moon
But when asked when will the fighting end, he only answers...soon

Man won't rest until events are being had
When you think about it, it's really kinda sad
Man is no longer in need of a friend
With no love for his fellow man, this could only mean the end
