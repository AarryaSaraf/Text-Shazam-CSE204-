It's time to wake up baby
Oh! I'm so glad I've got someone to wake up to
Thank you darling, for you're so easy to love
My precious tender girl, you make it so easy
You do everything just right
You put everything in the right places
You're so easy to love, you're so easy to love

You're my hopes, you're my dreams
Refreshingly rare
No matter where you might go
Darling turn and I'll be there
More in love than before
Heaven knows, I just can't
I just can't get enough

You're so easy, you're so easy
You're so easy to love

You put faith, you put love
In all that you do
It's a joy just to know
There is so much love in you
Just one touch does so much
Heaven knows I just can't
I just can't get enough

You're so easy, you're so easy
You're so easy to love
