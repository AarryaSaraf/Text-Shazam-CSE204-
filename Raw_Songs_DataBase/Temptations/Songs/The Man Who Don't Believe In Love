Over there sits the man
The man who don't believe in love
And as I sit here watching him
I'm wondering what he's talking of
Does he know what he's been missing?
The lovely girls he could have been kissing?

There goes the man
The man who don't believe in love

What's that you said
You had a love that broke your heart?
Well, just go right on and forget it
And make yourself a brand new start
I know her leaving, gonna make you cry
But don't use tears for an alibi

And don't be the man
The man who don't believe in love

Hey, hey
Hey, brother
Stop feeling that way if you do
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know
If one plan don't work, surely another one will
So you'll have, have her
Don't let happiness pass you by

Don't be the man
The man who don't believe in love
You don't have to be that man
The man who don't believe in love
Don't let happiness, happiness pass you by
You don't have to use tears for an alibi
Believe me when I tell you
