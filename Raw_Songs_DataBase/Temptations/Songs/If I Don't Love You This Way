Listen, baby

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say?
If I don't need you this much
Baby, why do I ache for your touch?

With you it seems I can reach the stars
With reckless hopes and dreams
But you, it seems still don't believe
How valuable you are

I really love you, baby
I'm not pretending to

If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong?
How can you doubt that I care, baby
When I'm with you everywhere?

With you I find I can close my eyes
To the world surrounding me
And you create the sweetest days
That I could ever be

I really, really, really love you, baby
I'm not pretending to

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say?
If I don't need you this much
Baby, why do I ache for your touch, touch?

You just have to smile
To make my life worthwhile
Doesn't that explain
That I'm playing no games

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say?
If I don't need you this much
Baby, why do I ache for your touch, touch?

If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong?
How can you doubt that I care, baby
When I'm with you everywhere?
If I don't love you this way
