All my hopes and dreams are forgotten now
All the apples in my barrel are rotten now
Standing on a mountain of misery
Loneliness is my only company
Oh, when are gonna come cindy
When will you be homeward bound
I'm in need of you and the love of you Cindy

I thought we were birds of a feather now
And we would always be together now
And where ever i would go you would follow me
A life of love with you was my destiny
Oh, when you gonna come come home cindy
When will you be homeward bound
there's an empty space
since you left this place

Cindy, my cindy
Come back cindy comeback
Cindy you have made a great mistake
But mistakes were sometimes made to save
Cindy love is made of give and take
Let a move be made for love's sake
Come on home Cant you see 
I was made for you, 
you were made for me!

People tell me I'm not the same now
I only half respond to my name now
But no one knows it better than me myself baby
Without your love I can never be myself
Ohhhhhh, when you gonna come home cindy
Cindy, my cindy
