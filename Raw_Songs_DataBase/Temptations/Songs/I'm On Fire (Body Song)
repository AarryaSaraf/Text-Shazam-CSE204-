(I'm on fire) I'm on fire
(Ooh ooh ooh)

(I'm on fire) for you

I look at you
And I get hot all over
'Cause
You got me burnin' for you

(I'm on fire) Fire! Oh oh!
Baby!

(I'm on fire) for you

(I hold you in my arms)
(My love rises to the stars)

'Cause you got me burning for you

Let me touch you
Everywhere I want to

'Cause I can't wait no longer
This feeling keeps getting stronger!
Baby baby
Let me have you (got me burning)
My whole (my body's yearning for you)

I'm burning
I'm yearning
Oh
I'm needing you
Oh baby, you've got me tasting

(Give me some!) I'm on fire
Baby!
(I'm on fire) You've got me burning
Got me yearning
Baby please

(I hold you in my arms)
(My love rises to the stars)
'Cause you got me burning
My whole body's yearning for you

Baby
Oh, baby (for you)

(I'm on fire) I'm so hot for your body, baby
Yeah

(I'm on fire) The way you walk
And when you talk ooh, such sweet body language
(I'm on fire) The nearness of you, I get misty blue

I'm on fire...
