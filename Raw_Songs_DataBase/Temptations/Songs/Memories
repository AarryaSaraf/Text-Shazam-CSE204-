Where went late night movies and you by my side
Where went popcorn, candy. My love, we did it right
Weren't we romantic, oh yeah, and what we knew so well
So sentimental, baby, anyone could tell

Memories, my heart treasures
Those little things that could make us laugh, make us cry
Memories, lonely measures
Why did we say goodbye

Funny secrets, glances we knew from deep inside
Money didn't matter to us 'cause we had life
Tell me what happened to us when we had so much
Where did we lose our hearts' trust. How I miss your touch

Memories, my heart treasures
Those little things that could make us laugh, make us cry
Memories, lonely measures
Why did we say goodbye

Sunny days just aren't the same
Without you in my life
Rainy nights can't stir the flame
The magic's just not right
How I find

Memories, my heart treasures
Those little things that could make us laugh, make us cry
Memories, lonely measures
Why did we say goodbye

Memories, my heart treasures
Memories, lonely measures
Tell me why did we have to say goodbye

Memories, my heart treasures
Those little things that could make us laugh, make us cry
Memories, lonely measures
Tell me why did we have to say goodbye

Popcorn, candy, cake and ice cream
Gee I wish things could be the way they used to be
Tell me why did we have to say goodbye

Memories, my heart treasures
Those little things that could make us laugh, make us cry
Memories, lonely measures
Why did we say goodbye

Memories, my heart treasures
Those little things that could make us laugh, make us cry
Memories, lonely measures
Tell me why did we have to say goodbye

Memories, my heart treasures
Memories, lonely measures
