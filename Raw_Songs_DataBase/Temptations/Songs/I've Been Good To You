Look what you've done
You made a fool out of someone (out of someone)
You thought love was true
And found out that you were just having fun (just having fun)

And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After all, I've been good to you (I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have

And I recall the time, mmm-hmm
You needed somebody and I made you mine
You needed a friend so I took you in
And treated you so kind

And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After all, I've been good to you (I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have

And you know I've always been around
And I never, never, never let you down
And now you telling me that you must go
You know that you're hurting me so...

But there, there come a time
One day, one day, one day you're gonna wake up and find
You'll come back to me on your bending knee
And you're gonna be crying

And oh, believe me, what I say is true, baby
After all, Lord, I've been good to you (I've been good to you)
Every day, and every way (I've been good to you)
Whoa, you know, you know, you know, baby, I've been so good
(I've been good to you)
