If there's someone else in this world you love more than me
I won't be selfish, girl, I'll just set you free
And when you're leaving, I won't cry, and I won't sigh
I'll say the words 'goodbye' and throw you a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo hoo

Remember, it doesn't take much to make a man cry when he's in love, oh yeah
So don't, don't let it you bother you when the tears start to fill my eyes, oh yeah
No, don't let my cryin' change your mind
Just tell me the words 'goodbye' and throw me a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo hoo

I know the grass looks greener, so much greener on the other side
But listen, you won't miss your water until your well runs dry

And when his love, his love for you grows old, yeah
And suddenly you find yourself left in the cold, yeah
You've got to be strong when things go wrong
Just tell him the words 'goodbye' and throw him a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo
Somethin' that you won't miss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo hoo
And throw him a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss
