I'm on a big ship
On the high waves  of time
I've followed every dream in life
That ever crossed my mind
Beyond each horizon
I find less that I left behind

Oh, how I miss you, Mary Ann
I'd love to taste your love again
My sail's awaiting for the wind

Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!
Mary! Ann!

Out in the sea of doubt
I weathered every storm
I'm the captain of my ship
A sailor, I was born
I've had queens in castles
On clouds in the sky

But my heart sent to you, Mary Ann
My mind's on coming home again
My sail's awaiting for the wind

Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!
Mary! Ann!

I'd like to imagine you on the shores at dawn
And you, oh my pretty one, gentle as a fawn
And as I row my boat ashore
My dream is that we go home baby

Oh how I miss you Mary Ann
I'd love to be back home again
My sail's awaiting for the wind

Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!
Mary! Ann!
