Changes, that's what you put me through
Slipping and sliding
Creeping and hiding
You better beware of the

Snake in the grass (beware)
He will surely bite (he will surely bite you)
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself)
Watch yourself

Adam and Eve first discovered
How low down the snake could be
Well he enticed them to taste the apple
Well, well, well
From the forbidden fruit tree

And ever since that time they've come
In every shape fashion and form
Seemingly harmless, yet their souls are possessed
With evil intentions and harm
I'm talking about the

Snake in the grass (He might be out there)
He will surely bite you	s
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself)
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass (ooh he's evil)
He will surely bite you
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself)
Watch yourself

You see I found out about my friend
And how low down dirty he could be, well, well
I gave him all of my trust, yes I did
But you know he mislead me
He tried to take everything
That I own right from under my feet, yes he did
Tried to make time with that woman of mine
He turned out to be a snake in a man's disguise

Snake in the grass (ooh he's evil)
He will surely bite you
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself)
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you (better watch yourself)
Watch yourself

It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame

One more thing I would like to say is
He tried to take everything that I owned right from
Under my feet, lord he did
Tried to make time with that woman of mine
He turned out to be snake in a man's disguise

Snake in the grass (ooh he's evil)
He will surely bite you
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself,
Better watch yourself)
Talking about the
Snake in the grass (he's all around you)
He will surely bite you
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself)
Watch yourself

Talking about the snake in the grass
I'm talking about the snake in the grass
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass (he's out there)
He will surely bite you
(Got to watch yourself got to watch yourself)
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass (ooh he's evil)
He will surely bite you
(Hiding, sneaking hiding, sneaking all around you)
Watch yourself
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass (yes)
He will surely bite you (better watch yourself,
Better watch yourself, better watch yourself)
Talking about the
Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you

You better, you better
(Watch yourself)
You better, you better
(Watch yourself)
Watch out for the
Snake in the grass

Watch out for the snake in the grass
Watch out because he's moving mighty fast now
Watch out for the snake in the grass
I can promise, don't let him fool you
Watch out for the snake in the grass
Because he's moving so, moving so fast

You better watch out (watch out)
You can't judge a book by the cover
Watch out (watch out)
It might be your soul-blood brother
Watch out (watch out)
Hey, snakes have been around for a long long time
So watch out (watch out)
Ooh, don't be surprised what you might find out

Snake in the grass (ooh he's evil)
He will surely bite you (slipping, weaving all
Around you, crawling all around you)
Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you

Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you
Watch yourself
Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you
