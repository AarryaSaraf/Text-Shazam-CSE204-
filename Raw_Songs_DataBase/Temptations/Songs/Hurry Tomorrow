Hey Damon, Damon! Is that you, man?
Hey, what's, what's happenin'?
What it is, what it is!
What you into man? I see you got a heavy ride, all clean...
Yeah I just copped man, just copped, you know, like hey, dig it!
I got something I wanna lay on you brother, it's the brand new thing, it's the bomb! You know?
What you got? What is it?
Mm, dig it man, you just take this and it's a brand new experience!
Nah, nuh-uh, it ain't me man, you know
Oh, what you mean, I-I tried it man, it's really really hip, it's hip
Everything will be alright tomorrow
(Everything will be alright tomorrow)
Come on man, just take it, it's really hip, I mean, I tried it, I tried it, it's cool
(Everything will be alright tomorrow)

Melting colours
That paint a picture of a new day in my mind
That I can't find at the present time, mmm
Reaching out and touching nothing
A feeling I've never felt before
(Pacing, racing, and chasing myself)
In a room without a floor or door

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

I'm goin' down, down, down
I'm goin' round
Where am I now? (Where am I now?)
The world is crumbling down
I'm laughing, I'm crying
But I still can't hear a sound

Hurry tomorrow, please
Tomorrow, I need you now
Oh, hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Good morning sunshine
(Or is it rain? It's hard to tell without windows)
I'm hurting all over
But I can't feel the pain
Screaming sounds of silence
Pound against the walls of my mind
The sun's shinin' in the middle of the night
I'm locked in, and tomorrow's nowhere in sight

Hurry tomorrow, hmm
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow, mmm
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

(You better hurry)
Hurry tomorrow, mmm
Tomorrow, I need you now (Body's filled with pain)
Hurry tomorrow (Don't you know I forgot my name)
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow (Why don't you hurry tomorrow?)
Tomorrow, I need you now (Ooh, hurry, hurry, hurry)
Hurry tomorrow (Please, please, please, please)
Tomorrow, I need you now (Somebody bring me down)

Hurry tomorrow (Bring me down)
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow (Body's racked in a whole lotta pain)
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow (Can't you see?)
Tomorrow, I need you now (Bring me down)
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow (Somebody, somebody)
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow (Won't you come and help me now)
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
