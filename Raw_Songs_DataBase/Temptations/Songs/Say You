Say, you
Who do you belong to?
Say, you
I've been hoping to meet you

Baby (Baby)
You've caught my eye
I can't deny
I realize it's you
I like what I see (I like it)
You're perfect to me (I like it)
Fast and fancy

Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)

I don't want to be friends if my heart caved in
Watching you play around (You play around)
This would make me mad (Make me mad)
Hurt so bad (Hurt so bad)
Drag my spirit down

Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)

There's none quite as fair as you
(You're a sweet thing)
Let's make plans for two
Girl, say, you
If you love me, too, say you do
We shouldn't be apart
Forget your pride (Forget your pride)
Don't be shy (Don't be shy)
Give me the key to your heart, girl

Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)
Who, who do you love?

(Baby, give me the key to your heart)
Baby, say, you
Who do you belong to?
(Baby, give me the key to your heart)
Baby, baby, you, (say, you) lil' girl
(Baby, give me the key to your heart)
