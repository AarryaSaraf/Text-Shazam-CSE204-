 Yes, my skin is black,
But that's no reason to hold me back
 Why don't you think about it,
Think about it, think about it, think about it,
Think about it...
I have wants and desires,
Just like you
So move on the side
'Cause I'm comin' through, oh!

 No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now
Eddie and Temptations: No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now, oooh...

 Yes, your skin is white...
Does that make you right?
 Why don't you think about it,
Think about it, think about it, think about it,
Think about it...
This is a message
A message to y'all,
Together we stand,
Divided we fall, oh!

 Black is a color
Just like white,
Tell me how can a color determine whether
You're wrong or right,
We all have our faults...
Yes we do

 So look in your mirror
 Look in the mirror
 What do you see?
 What do you see?
 Two eyes,
 Two eyes,
 A nose, and a mouth just like me, oh!

 Your eyes are open
But you refuse to see,
The laws of society
Were made for both you and me,
Because of my color,
I struggle to be free
Sticks and stones,
May break my bones
But in the end,
You're gonna' see my friend, oh!

 No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now




 Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

 Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

 Say it!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

 Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

 Say it loud!
 I'm black and I'm proud!
 No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

 Say it loud!
 I'm black and I'm proud!
 No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now
