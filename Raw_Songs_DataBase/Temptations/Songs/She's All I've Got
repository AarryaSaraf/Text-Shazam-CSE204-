Every time I turn my head
Somebody's trying to beat my time
I can understand how they feel
But this little woman's mine
She's got a million dollar smile
And her heart is made of gold
I'll be with her forever and that's how the story goes

Because baby she's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got
She's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got

I need a sweet inspiration morning noon and night
(Sweet, sweet, so sweet)
I got so much respect for my lady
Anything she says is right
Making love to her is so damn good
It just gets Better every time
And I'm so glad that she's with me
Because a good woman's hard to find

Because baby she's all I've got
And she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got (yes she does)

She's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got

Ain't going to take too much to tell nobody
About my lady

She's all I've got and she means so much to me
All I've got; she's all I've got (yes she does)
She's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got

She's all I've got and she means so much to me
(Yes she is)
All I've got; she's all I've got
(I don't want to ever lose her)
She's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got

Just want to talk about my lady for a little while
Yes I do, yeah I do
I just want you to know
She's so fine; so glad she's mine
She's so fine; so glad she's mine

And every time I get up in the morning
And I see her by my side
She makes me feel so good (feel so good)
I feel so good
Feel so good, I feel so good
Because my baby, she's the one that I love
And I feel so good when I'm by her side
Making love to her is so dog-gone good
It gets better every time
She's got a million dollar smile
And I'm so glad that smile is mine

Feel so good
She's my baby
My baby, she's all I've got and she's means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got
(She's my sweet inspiration)
She's all I've got and she means a lot to me

All I've got; she's all I've got
(She's got a million dollar smile)
She's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got
