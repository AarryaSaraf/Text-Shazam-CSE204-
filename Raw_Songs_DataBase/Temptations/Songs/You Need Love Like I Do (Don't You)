Well, well, well, well
Seems like it was only yesterday
When my mama told me don't fall in love
With the first guy that comes your way

He was handsome and nice
But, I took her advice and passed him by
Years have passed and don't look like
Love's gonna give me a second try

Boy, the look on your face tells me you understand
Could it be your love life's like mine
Needs a helping hand well, well
You need love like I do
(Don't you?)

Boy, I can tell by the way
You look when I'm looking at you
I know it ain't fit and proper
For a girl to talk this way

But, I can't cope with this loneliness
Not one more doggone day
Everyday has been an uphill climb
Keeping my hopes a-float

Judging from your silence boy
You must be in the same boat
Ain't it true now?
You need love like I do
(Don't you?)

Boy, I can tell by the way you look
When I'm looking at you
Well, well, well, you need love like I do
(Don't you?)
