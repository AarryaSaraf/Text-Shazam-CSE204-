Well, well, well...
I gotta get away from you, girl, as fast as I can
Too much for me, woman
More than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You've been reckless with my heart
If I stayed around
You'd surely tear it all apart

The road has got to end somewhere
Woman, woman, every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road

Oh, I'm thinkin' 'bout all those times you left me at home lonely
You only did it 'cause you knew I love you only
Runnin', runnin' around with every guy in town
I'm tellin' you, woman, no longer will I be your clown

Said the road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
I'm sick and tired of your stuff
Said enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sho'nuff, lady, I just got to...

Woman, there's no sense in you beggin' and pleadin'
Talkin' 'bout I'm the one you're leavin'
Said I done had my fill of you
Girl, you've cut me so through the years
I done sho'nuff ran out of tears
I couldn't cry if I wanted to

Said the road has got to end somewhere, honey honey
Every road has got to end somewhere
Time and again I've begged you to slow down
So I'm givin' you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road, road, road, road, road

(This is the end of our road)
I, I can't take it no more
(This is the end of our road)
Packin' up my clothes, walk out the door
(This is the end of our road)
I, I can't take it no more
(This is the end of our road)
Packin' up my clothes, walking out the door...
