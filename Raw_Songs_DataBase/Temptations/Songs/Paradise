Paradise, it's being here with you
Close to your heart
Oh, the sweet harmony, is beautiful

Tenderly, you receive my love
I release myself and we are one
Flowing deep, like a river
You rejoice inside, and we are one

In your eyes
I see an open door 
That leads straight to your heart
All the way to your soul, it's beautiful

Paradise

A picture is worth a thousand words
A feeling is worth it more and more

Flowing deep, like a river
you rejoice inside, and we are one

Paradise, it's being here with you
Close to your heart
Oh, the sweet harmony, is beautiful
