Farewell, my love.
Farewell, my love.

I love you more than anything.
No one knows the good you bring....
Eddie: to me.


But I've got to set you free. (Boo-oo)
I've just got to set you free. (Boo-oo)


Aww, goodbye, (goodbye) my love. (My love)
I'm gonna cry, (gonna cry) my love. (My love)

The vow of love you broken.
The law of love has spoken....
Eddie: to you.


Oh, why couldn't you be true? (Why couldn't you be true?)
Why couldn't you be true? (Why couldn't you be true?)


So long, baby. You know, it's so hard...
It's really hard to find someone in this wide world, who's really true.
I guess it's just meant for me to be unhappy.
But I believe, I really do believe that somewhere someone is waiting for me.


Aww, she's there, (she's there) my love. (My love)
Somewhere, (somewhere) my love. (My love)

Someone who cares.
And still be there...
Eddie: with me.


Oh, my darling can't you see? (Boo-oo)
How wonderful it would be, yeah. (Boo-oo)

Farewell, to you.
Farewell, my love.
Eddie: We're...
Through.


We're through.
