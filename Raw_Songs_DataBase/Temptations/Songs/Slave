Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!
Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!
Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!

Hear that sound
The hammers pound and pound
From sun up to sundown
Men from all walks of life
Are livin' here in shame
Now they're known by numbers
They've been stripped of their name

Oh, breaking rocks
Serving my time
So I can get out to find
Peace of mind
Jailer, bring me water (Jailer, bring me water)
I can't pound no longer

Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!

In the morning I slave in the hot sun for little or no wage
At night I'm locked in, like an animal in a cage
Man stunted on me with a gun
Sayin' "I bet a man"
Oh, in a hole I have to spend
The rest of my time

Hey, breaking rocks, y'all
Serving my time
So I can get out to find
Peace of mind
Jailer, bring me water (Jailer, bring me water)
I can't pound no longer

Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!

Ow, hold it steady right there while I hit it, hit it!
While I'm breakin' it down, I'm gonna get it now

Inside these walls, the days seem to never end
In this place there's no such thing as a friend
Sometimes, sometimes, I wish I was there
I can't get no sleep, I've got rats in my bed, ooh

Breaking rocks
Serving my time
So I can get out to find
Peace of mind
Jailer, bring me water (Jailer, bring me water)
Or I'll surely be a goner

(I'm just a slave, yah)
(I'm just a slave, y'all)
(I'm just a slave, yah)
(I'm just a slave, y'all)

(I'm just a slave, yah)
(I'm just a slave, y'all)

Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!
Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!
Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!

Jailer, bring me water
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)
I can't pound no longer
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)
Jailer, bring me water (Breakin' rocks, servin' my time)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)
I can't pound no longer (So I can get out to find peace of mind)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)

Ooh, jailer, bring me water (I'm breakin' rocks, servin' my time)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)
I can't pound no longer (So I can get out to find peace of mind)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)

Oh oh, jailer, bring me water (Always have it right here, while I hit it)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)
I can't pound no longer (I've had some bet, gonna get it back)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)

Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave
Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave (Free me, free me)
Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave
Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave (Free me, free me)
