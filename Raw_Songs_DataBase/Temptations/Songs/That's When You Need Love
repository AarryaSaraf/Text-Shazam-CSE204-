Sometimes, when you need an arm around you
Sometimes, when you need a friend
Life has you twistin' and turning
You feel the need, the need to win

That's when you need love
To help you in that hour
That's when you need love
To help you in that moment

You feel the need for tenderness
Just a little bit of sweet happiness

Times, when you look around for shelter
You need the warmth of someone else
Sometimes, to be there close by you
To help you, to help yourself

That's when you need love
To help you in that hour
That's when you need love
To help you in that moment

I know you need love, yes you do
'Cause everybody needs love, sometimes
And baby I just want to tell you, sometime
I know just what you need, ah girl
I need the need to be needed
Don't you feel the need sometimes?
When you have the feeling
something's missing
You get an empty feeling inside
I know what you need
I know what you need
I know just what you need

That's when you need love
To help you in that hour
That's when you need love
To help you in that moment
