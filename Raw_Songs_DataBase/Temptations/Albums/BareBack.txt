// Mystic Woman (Love Me Over) //

Like a marathon, that's keeping on
I'm running
Trying to catch you
You 20th century girl
Live inside your force
Steady on your course
Let me trip into your star war world
Mystic woman, slow down for me

Love me over, love me over
Mystic woman
Such a righteous thing
Love me over, love me over
Touch my feelings
Make me feel brand new
Feelings, feelings

When I'm with you
No deja vu in my life
New horizons always will be found
Make me your intentions
Let me move in your dimensions
Then paradise together we are bound

Love me over, love me over
Mystic woman
Such a righteous thing
Love me over, love me over
Touch my feelings
Make me feel brand new
Feelings, feelings

Mystic woman, slow down for me
Love me over, love me over
Mystic woman, such a righteous thing
Love me over, love me over

// I Just Don't Know How To Let You Go //

I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose
I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose

Hooked on a feeling
I'm on a rocky road
The trip's too heavy
To carry this load

Like a roller coaster
Moves too fast
You got me sinking
I just can't last

Hooked on this feeling
Hooked on this ride
Can't get off this feeling
I just can't step aside

I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose
I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose

You wind me up, take my best
Run me down, when you leave the rest
Like a roller coaster
Moving fast
Like a rocky boat
I'm out of gas

You're flying high, too high for me
I can't hold on, I can't get free

I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose
I just don't know how to let you go
I just don't know how to shake you loose

// That's When You Need Love //

Sometimes, when you need an arm around you
Sometimes, when you need a friend
Life has you twistin' and turning
You feel the need, the need to win

That's when you need love
To help you in that hour
That's when you need love
To help you in that moment

You feel the need for tenderness
Just a little bit of sweet happiness

Times, when you look around for shelter
You need the warmth of someone else
Sometimes, to be there close by you
To help you, to help yourself

That's when you need love
To help you in that hour
That's when you need love
To help you in that moment

I know you need love, yes you do
'Cause everybody needs love, sometimes
And baby I just want to tell you, sometime
I know just what you need, ah girl
I need the need to be needed
Don't you feel the need sometimes?
When you have the feeling
something's missing
You get an empty feeling inside
I know what you need
I know what you need
I know just what you need

That's when you need love
To help you in that hour
That's when you need love
To help you in that moment

// Bare Back //

Ride it Bare Back
Get up on it and ride
Ride it Bare Back
It's the natural thing to do

Don't waste time foolish dreaming
Get your life into the main stream
Before the ... hits the fan
Life is real, it's a mother
Hold on strong
Don't let it throw ya

Ride it Bare Back
Get up on it and ride
Ride it Bare Back
It's the natural thing to do

If the love in your life
Don't put life in your love
Everywhere
There's complications
Life is real, it's a mother
Hold on strong
Don't let it throw ya

Ride it Bare Back
Get up on it and ride
Ride it Bare Back
It's the natural thing to do

// Ever Ready Love //

I never knew any one woman's love
Could have such an effect on me
Reaches down in my heart (way down)
Fires up my soul
Brings out all the needs in me, ooh!

Give it up baby, baby give it up
(I said baby give it up)
(I said baby give it up)
I'm coming back for more
So open your doors
Ooh baby
I've got an ever ready love
Woo hoo baby
I got an ever ready love

How did I ever underestimate
What the love of a woman can do
When, darling pound for pound
I admit I've found
All the best love in you, ooh!

Give it up baby, baby give it up
(I said baby give it up)
(I said baby give it up)
I'm coming back for more
So open your doors
Ooh baby
I've got an ever ready love, take it baby
Woo hoo baby
I got an ever ready love, just for you girl

(Ever ready love)
(Ever ready love)

Ooh, give it up baby, baby give it up
(I said baby give it up)
(I said baby give it up)
I got love on my mind, I need you by my side

I got an ever ready love, take it baby
Well, ooh ooh
I got an ever ready love, just for you girl
Baby, I got an ever ready love

// Wake Up To Me //

Oh how nice it would be
To have you wake up, close to me
Be the first thing I see
In the morning

Just to reach out and feel
You are here, you are real
Not just a dream, not a dream, oh a dream
I've been dreaming

Wake up to me
Wake up to me

We've been in love, much too long
This love we feel is much too strong
For night to find us all alone
In separate places

Oh to reach out and feel
To have you close, to have you near
To warm each night
Until the morning

Wake up to me
Wake up to me

// You're So Easy To Love //

It's time to wake up baby
Oh! I'm so glad I've got someone to wake up to
Thank you darling, for you're so easy to love
My precious tender girl, you make it so easy
You do everything just right
You put everything in the right places
You're so easy to love, you're so easy to love

You're my hopes, you're my dreams
Refreshingly rare
No matter where you might go
Darling turn and I'll be there
More in love than before
Heaven knows, I just can't
I just can't get enough

You're so easy, you're so easy
You're so easy to love

You put faith, you put love
In all that you do
It's a joy just to know
There is so much love in you
Just one touch does so much
Heaven knows I just can't
I just can't get enough

You're so easy, you're so easy
You're so easy to love

// I See My Child //

Don't cry, run along
Someday you might understand

I see my child
Standing over there with you
It's a lonely room we're standing in
With a lawyer and judge deciding
The dividing of our lives

Try as I will, I can't explain
Just when the thrill turned into pain

The love I have for your mother
Ain't the same love I have for you, no
Though it seems I don't love her at all
I'll always love your mom thru you
Now go on take Momma's hand, young man
Don't cry run along
Someday you might understand

Grown-ups may change, yes
A child will see one thing remains we're family

The love I have for you son
Is the kind of love that will never stop
Although your Momma might find someone else
You both will stay here in my heart

I see my child
Standing over there with you
It's a lonely room we're standing in
With a lawyer and judge deciding
The dividing of our lives

// Touch Me Again //

Touch me, touch me, touch me again
Yeah
Touch me, touch me, touch me again

I explode with excitement when you're near
To be near you I'll go baby, anywhere
'Cause you thrill me like no one else
I just love ya, love you to death
Love one me, I'll love on you
Loving together, nice thing to do

Can you fee it?
Feel the love

Touch me, touch me, touch me again
Yeah
Touch me, touch me, touch me again

Over here, over there everywhere
Touch my mind, touch my soul, show me you care
'Cause you thrill me like no one else
I just love ya, love you to death
Love on me, I'll love on you
Loving together, nice thing to do

Touch me, touch me, touch me again
Yeah
Touch me, touch me, touch me again
