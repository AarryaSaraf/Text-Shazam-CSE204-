// Keep Holding On //

Your truth is like
A woman brought me
Since I've been here
A woman taught me

Don't worry about
What you can't control
Do your best
And leave the rest alone

Keep holding on
Sometimes your back is against the wall
Keep hanging on
Hang on
You gotta keep holding on
You know I...

Enjoy these chains
Your so bright
'Cause you never?
You gotta celebrate, celebrate
Every day you live

I still remember
Since I was just a child
My mother held me in her arms
Mama said, that every day

You got to keep holding on
Don't let nothin' get around you
Keep holding on
Hang on
You gotta keep holding on

Son, gotta keep holding on
Hang on tight
Give your life a fight
You gotta be strong
Keep on pushing on

Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on

Keep holding on, hang on
Hold on, keep holding on

Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on

// What You Need Most (I Do Best Of All) //

Darling, my darling, my darling
I want to please you
Darling, my darling, my darling
I want to please you, oh!

I watch everything you say and do
And that's because I'm interested in you, oh
You may think that I pay you no mind
But I can see the hurt there in your eyes

How long can you keep on hiding
Wearing a smile that is upside down
You just look over your shoulder
I'll be around, oh!

What you need most, I do best of all
You need love and it shows
You don't fool me at all

When your at home all by yourself
I bet you play games with yourself, (oh, why, why, why)
Like setting a table for two
Knowing that there be only just you

Life don't have to be that way
Once you realize what you need
And what you need now, darling, it just be, oh!

What you need most, I do best of all
Honey, you need love and shows
You don't fool me at all

Here I am, here I am with open arms, dear
Like your shadow, I've always been near
For I know just what you been through
'Cause I've walked that same road too

So, just make up your mind
What you're looking for ain't hard to find

What you need
I do best of all
Honey, you need love and it shows
You don't fool me at all

What you need most (what'cha need girl, what'cha need girl)
I do best of all (what'cha need, what'cha need, what'cha need girl)
You need love and it shows (what'cha need girl, what'cha need girl)
You don't fool me at all (what'cha need, what'cha need, what'cha need girl)

Ooh! (darling, my darling, my darling, best of all)
La la la la la la la la la la la la la...
Yeah! Baby! (darling, my darling, my darling, best of all)
I know what'cha need and I'm right here to give it to you
Take my hand!

// If I Don't Love You This Way //

Listen, baby

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say?
If I don't need you this much
Baby, why do I ache for your touch?

With you it seems I can reach the stars
With reckless hopes and dreams
But you, it seems still don't believe
How valuable you are

I really love you, baby
I'm not pretending to

If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong?
How can you doubt that I care, baby
When I'm with you everywhere?

With you I find I can close my eyes
To the world surrounding me
And you create the sweetest days
That I could ever be

I really, really, really love you, baby
I'm not pretending to

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say?
If I don't need you this much
Baby, why do I ache for your touch, touch?

You just have to smile
To make my life worthwhile
Doesn't that explain
That I'm playing no games

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say?
If I don't need you this much
Baby, why do I ache for your touch, touch?

If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong?
How can you doubt that I care, baby
When I'm with you everywhere?
If I don't love you this way
