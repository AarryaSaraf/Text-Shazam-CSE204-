// Think For Yourself //

We're expecting miracles from the Whitehouse
Tell me how much can one man do
He's just trying to pull the world together
To make it better it's up to me and you

The first role of man
is self-revelation from god
Don't be led astray
You're leaning on somebody's job

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you
Oh your job for you
I wish you would (think for yourself)
Stop depending on someone else
Ooh, to do your (job for you)
Don't you let them (do your job for you)
Well

Think
You got to (think)

Keeping up with the pace of the space age
Inventors drawing blueprints every day
Automation means conductive labor
Be prepared for whatever comes your way

Educate your mind
Because you've still got time to pursue
Any dream in mind
It's your life; it's all up to you

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you
Oh your job for you
Do your job for you

Think for yourself

Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you
Oh your job for you

Think
Stay in school
Think
Don't be a fool

Educate your mind
Because you've still got time to pursue
Any dream in mind
It's your life; it's all up to you

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you (do it yourself)
Oh your job for you
Do your job for you (come on, come on)

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you
Oh your job for you (do your job, do your job)

Think
Stay in school
That's what I call being cool
Think
Get out that line
Stop wasting time

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
(Stop depending on someone else)
To do your job for you (do your job)
Oh your job for you (don't you let them)

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you (do you job for you)
Oh your job for you (do your job for you)

Think
We've got to use our minds
I'm so tired of hearing the plea that I can't do this and
That ain't me
I don't want to hear
That's what I could've done; that's what I should've
Done; that's what I would've done
Think for yourself
Think (well, well)
Think (come on)
Stop and use your head
Think (we've got to work)
Think (got to use our minds)
Stop and use your head (got to stop wasting time)

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you (do your job)
Oh your job for you (do your job)

// In A Lifetime //

What am I going to do

Since you went away
I ain't had nothing much to say, no
I been keeping to myself the reasons why you left
I walked around bewildered
Because she caught me in the wrong
There was nothing I could say
To keep her from leaving home

I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime baby
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime

I know that I was wrong
Because you can't share love with two

I just took a chance
A chance on losing you
I lost my pride and joy because
I was careless with her heart
I didn't believe nothing could ever tear us apart

I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime baby
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime baby

I'll never find (oh never find)
Another love (never ever find)
In a lifetime, in a lifetime
Oh I'll never find (oh never find)
Another love (never ever find)
In a lifetime, in a lifetime

It'll shake your world over
I ain't never found no loving like you do
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime baby
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime baby

// Can We Come And Share In Love //

I'm an Aries
And you're a Libra
We should be so incompatible (incompatible)
But each time you touch me I know that we're
An exception to the rule

You're folks and mine, oh they both agree
That you don't belong with me
But they can't live our lives for us
Only you and I can decide

Our future; our fate
Fate

Can we come and share in love
I just want to know girl, come on
Love, love, love, love, let's share in love

Odds are we will stay in love
Stay in love
Let us stay in love

Now I'm a man and you're a woman
That is all love needs to make it bloom
(Needs to make bloom)
So if we can deal with each other
I don't care what people may say
I don't care what they may say, no, no, no
Since the beginning of the history of man
Love and romance has always been
The important part of the master plan
Only you and I can decide
Our future; our fate
Fate

Can we come and share in love
People say that our love won't last
But the strong of the heart take the greater task
Love, love, love, love, let's share in love
I just want to love you

Odds are we will stay in love
Yes we will; we're going to stay in love
Stay in love

Can we come and share in love
Can we share, can we share my baby
Love,love,love,love,let's share in love
Can't you hear me baby pleading

Odds are we will stay in love
Ooh, we're going to stay in love
Stay in love

Oh, come on baby
Let me talk to you just a moment
Just want to squeeze you
Because I know that it will please you

Love, love, love, love, let's share in love
Stay in love with you because you mean so much to me
Love, love, love, love, let's share in love
Going to share my love with you girl
Because you mean so much to me
Love, love, love, love, let's share in love

// She's All I've Got //

Every time I turn my head
Somebody's trying to beat my time
I can understand how they feel
But this little woman's mine
She's got a million dollar smile
And her heart is made of gold
I'll be with her forever and that's how the story goes

Because baby she's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got
She's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got

I need a sweet inspiration morning noon and night
(Sweet, sweet, so sweet)
I got so much respect for my lady
Anything she says is right
Making love to her is so damn good
It just gets Better every time
And I'm so glad that she's with me
Because a good woman's hard to find

Because baby she's all I've got
And she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got (yes she does)

She's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got

Ain't going to take too much to tell nobody
About my lady

She's all I've got and she means so much to me
All I've got; she's all I've got (yes she does)
She's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got

She's all I've got and she means so much to me
(Yes she is)
All I've got; she's all I've got
(I don't want to ever lose her)
She's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got

Just want to talk about my lady for a little while
Yes I do, yeah I do
I just want you to know
She's so fine; so glad she's mine
She's so fine; so glad she's mine

And every time I get up in the morning
And I see her by my side
She makes me feel so good (feel so good)
I feel so good
Feel so good, I feel so good
Because my baby, she's the one that I love
And I feel so good when I'm by her side
Making love to her is so dog-gone good
It gets better every time
She's got a million dollar smile
And I'm so glad that smile is mine

Feel so good
She's my baby
My baby, she's all I've got and she's means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got
(She's my sweet inspiration)
She's all I've got and she means a lot to me

All I've got; she's all I've got
(She's got a million dollar smile)
She's all I've got and she means a lot to me
All I've got; she's all I've got

// Snake In The Grass //

Changes, that's what you put me through
Slipping and sliding
Creeping and hiding
You better beware of the

Snake in the grass (beware)
He will surely bite (he will surely bite you)
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself)
Watch yourself

Adam and Eve first discovered
How low down the snake could be
Well he enticed them to taste the apple
Well, well, well
From the forbidden fruit tree

And ever since that time they've come
In every shape fashion and form
Seemingly harmless, yet their souls are possessed
With evil intentions and harm
I'm talking about the

Snake in the grass (He might be out there)
He will surely bite you	s
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself)
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass (ooh he's evil)
He will surely bite you
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself)
Watch yourself

You see I found out about my friend
And how low down dirty he could be, well, well
I gave him all of my trust, yes I did
But you know he mislead me
He tried to take everything
That I own right from under my feet, yes he did
Tried to make time with that woman of mine
He turned out to be a snake in a man's disguise

Snake in the grass (ooh he's evil)
He will surely bite you
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself)
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you (better watch yourself)
Watch yourself

It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame

One more thing I would like to say is
He tried to take everything that I owned right from
Under my feet, lord he did
Tried to make time with that woman of mine
He turned out to be snake in a man's disguise

Snake in the grass (ooh he's evil)
He will surely bite you
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself,
Better watch yourself)
Talking about the
Snake in the grass (he's all around you)
He will surely bite you
(Better watch yourself better watch yourself)
Watch yourself

Talking about the snake in the grass
I'm talking about the snake in the grass
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass (he's out there)
He will surely bite you
(Got to watch yourself got to watch yourself)
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass (ooh he's evil)
He will surely bite you
(Hiding, sneaking hiding, sneaking all around you)
Watch yourself
I'm talking about the
Snake in the grass (yes)
He will surely bite you (better watch yourself,
Better watch yourself, better watch yourself)
Talking about the
Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you

You better, you better
(Watch yourself)
You better, you better
(Watch yourself)
Watch out for the
Snake in the grass

Watch out for the snake in the grass
Watch out because he's moving mighty fast now
Watch out for the snake in the grass
I can promise, don't let him fool you
Watch out for the snake in the grass
Because he's moving so, moving so fast

You better watch out (watch out)
You can't judge a book by the cover
Watch out (watch out)
It might be your soul-blood brother
Watch out (watch out)
Hey, snakes have been around for a long long time
So watch out (watch out)
Ooh, don't be surprised what you might find out

Snake in the grass (ooh he's evil)
He will surely bite you (slipping, weaving all
Around you, crawling all around you)
Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you

Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you
Watch yourself
Snake in the grass
He will surely bite you

// It's Time For Love //

It's time for love (it's time for love)
Open your arms and make a friend
You might need him in the end
All you got to do is take somebody's hand
We need peace and love today
We need love right away

They said there's a sex revolution going on, going strong
But that's not what we're talking about
We need to find the solution to jealousy, bigotry, enemies
Oh, it's time to enforce the plan
Make the rich share the fat of the land
All the killing and war must cease
What we all should be shooting for is peace

It's time for love
We need some loving right away
Open your arms and make a friend
You might need him in the end
It's time for love
Oh, let's lock arms hand in hand
We need peace and love today
We need love right away

There's buildings going up in flames
Hijacked planes, ransom notes
All just breaking down our hopes
Man is god's greatest creation
Don't disrespect the human race or
What gave them life
We got to live together in this world with one another
Oh, we need love so desperately
Love is the key to unity

It's time for love
It's time for love
Open your arms and make a friend
You might need him in the end
It's time for love
We need peace and love today
We need love right away

We need peace and love today (we need it)
We need love right away
Like yesterday

It's time for love (it's time for love)
It's time for love (it's time for love)
Open your arms and make a friend
You might need him in the end
It's time for love
All you got to do is take somebody's hand
We need peace and love today
We need love right away

It's time for love
It's time for love
It's time for love
It's time for love
Show love, oh love
It's time for love
It's time for love
It's time for love
It's time for love
We got to live together to make the world a better place
Loving and praying for one another will
Help the human race
Care about peace
And share with one another
We've got to love our enemies just like they're
Our brothers
Oh love, love, love, love
Oh love, love, love, love
It's time for love
It's time for love
It's time for love
We got to help our neighbors
We got to lift a helping hand
We've got to come together
Spread peace all over the land
We got to pray together
Work together
Love together
It's time for love
It's time for love

// Let's Live In Peace //

Where has all the love gone today
Have we no time to stop and pray
It's hard to believe in the man on the hill
Who can we trust and who will be for real

Let's come together and make a better place
Don't be afraid to lend a friend a hand
This old world we live in has got to make a change
It's plain to see that
Lord things just can't stay the same

All it takes is a little of your time
It's just a little of your time
Some of your time and the right frame of mind
It's up to you and me

We've got to live in peace
Let us live in peace
We've got to live in peace
Let us live in peace
Working together
Let us live

Is anybody listening to me
What about the children that are born new every day
They're innocent eyes look for the heart we throw away
Deep down inside can't you hear the children pray
Don't let the sun set on another wasted day

All it takes is a little of your time
It's just a little of your time
Some of your time and the right frame of mind
It's up to you and me

We've got to live in peace
Yes we do, yes we do
Let us live in peace
Work on it together
Helping one another
Let us live in peace
Let us live in peace
Let us live

Live, live, live, live
Let us live in peace
We've got live together, yes we do, yes we do, yes we do
(Let us live in peace)
We got to work with one another
(Let us live in peace)
We've got to get on up, get on up
And try to help somebody sometime
Everybody got to get on their knees sometime
And you got to pray

// Read Between The Lines //

No I'll never leave you
No I'll never leave you
No I'll never leave you
I ain't going nowhere

It's time that we had a little talk together
Something's going on when I'm away from you
Honey, now when we kiss (now when we kiss)
There's something that I miss
Where's that loving touch that I used to love so much
Now we've together for so long (for so long)
I can read you like a book (like a book)
You're acting strange
I can't stand the pain
Are you too far gone to change

If you can read between the lines
(You just might find)
Read between the lines
Never going to leave you

Read between the lines
You never know what you might find
That I'm never going to leave you
Never going to leave you

Now I might have been gone every now
And then neglected you (neglected you)
And put you through so many changes
I was trying to pursue a better life for me and you
But misery loves company, come on understand
That I'm just a man trying to do
The very very best I can (best I can)
But what's the use if you're running loose
You only get out what you put in

If you can read between the lines
(You just might find)
Read between the lines
That I'm never going to leave you
Never going to leave you

Read between the lines
You never know what you might find
That I'm never going to leave you
Never going to leave you

Read between the lines
You never know what you might find
That I'm never going to leave you
Never going to leave you

// I Could Never Stop Loving You //

I thought that I could live without your love
But it seems as though I never get enough
Since that first night you laid back in my arms
I haven't been the same, yeah
Guess I got you in my blood
Can't explain
The pleasure you give me (pleasure you give me)
No one can make do that

I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you
I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you

I need your love for more than just a night
Don't you know by now that I'm here for the rest of my life
No matter how many nights I choose to roam
You can rest assure girl that I'll be coming home to you
I can't afford to lose you (can't afford to lose you)
So glad I got to choose you (glad I got to choose you)
For my wife

I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you
I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you

A lot of love this night

I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you
I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you

I tried but I can't
I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you
I could never (baby I could never stop) loving you
I tried but I can't
But I can't stop loving you
