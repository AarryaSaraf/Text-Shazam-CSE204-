// Funky Music Sho Nuff Turns Me On //

I like the sound of funky music
Let me hear you sing it (I like the sound of funky music)
I like it
'Cause funky music sho nuff turns me on
I like the sound of funky music

Bless my soul, I can't control
The feeling I get when I hear the funky music
People, it does something to my brain
What it is I can't explain
Keep it right there
I don't want to lose it

Come on, come on, come on people now
Express yourself
Come on come on come on people now
I like the sound of funky music

My mind is singing
Everybody sing it sing it
I like it
'Cause funky music sho nuff turn me on
Music's got my soul on fire
I can feel the blood boiling in my veins
People I get a feeling deep down inside
Something like a rollercoaster ride
And I ain't ashamed to say that I feel alright
Funky now

Come on come on come on people and express yourself

Don't it make you feel alright
All you crazy people from the big city
Get on down to the nitty gritty
I like the sound of funky music
Everybody sing it with me (I like the sound of funky music)
'Cause funky music sho nuff turn me on

Boom boom boom
Like a river turns me
Boom boom boom

// Run Charlie Run //

I watch you go to church on Sunday
But you forget all you learned on Monday
You see your smiling face can't hide
How you hate your brother inside

So Ima telling you
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)

You built this great big beautiful city
But you ran away and left it to die. What a pity.
You could have made friends with your neighbor
But you are much too prejudiced to try; tell me why!

So Ima telling you
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)

But the greatest wrong you know you've done
Is you passed this sickness onto your son
(your one and only boy)
He came into this world with a mind so clean
You took it, molded it, and made it mean!

So Ima telling you
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
(The niggers are coming?!)

// Papa Was A Rollin' Stone //

It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember,
Yes, I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you
To tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said, "Son,..

[Chorus:]
Papa was a rolling stone.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.
Papa was a rolling stone, my son.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Hey, mama!
Is it true what they say that papa never worked a day in his life?
And, mama, some bad talk goin' round town sayin' that papa had three outside children and another wife,
And that ain't right
Heard them talking papa doing some store front preachin'
Talked about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in debt and stealing in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,

[Chorus]
"Papa was a rolling stone, my son.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.
Papa was a rolling stone.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Hey, mama,
I heard papa called himself a "Jack Of All Trades"
Tell me is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills
Hey, mama,
Folks say papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Mama, I'm depending on you
To tell me the truth
Mama looked up with a tear in her eye and said, "Son,..

[Chorus]
Papa was a rolling stone (well, well...)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

[Chorus]
I said, "Papa was a rolling stone (yes, he was, my son)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
My daddy was (papa was a rolling stone), yes, he was
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

// Love Woke Me Up This Morning //

Love woke me up this morning feelin' fine
I had you on my mind, oh oh
Love woke me up this morning
And I haven't had a heartache today, darlin'
All my little tears are gone away
Skies are blue because I have you, I love you

Love woke me up this morning, oh yes indeed
Thinkin' of last night
You know, you made me feel all right, oh
Love woke me up this morning
I'm so glad, yes I am
Because of you, happiness is mine
All my cloudy days are all behind

Baby, every place I see your face
And now I smile, you made my life worthwhile
Yes you did

I haven't had a heartache today
And all my little tears are gone away
Because of you, happiness is mine
And all my cloudy days are all behind

// I Ain't Got Nothin' //

You know, every house has a door and every room has a floor.
Every fence has a gate and every beast has a mate.
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.
I ain't got nothing.

Every stove has a fire and every car has a tire.
Every fish has a bowl and every shoe has a sole.
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.
I ain't got nothing.

Now I don't care about politics and things across the sea.
All I want all I want to do is love 
And have somebody love me. I need I need somebody.

Every lion has a den and every little pig has its pen.
Every road has a way and (they tell me) every dog has its day.
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.
I ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing. Oh no.
...

// The First Time Ever (I Saw Your Face) //

The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies, my love,
To the dark and the empty skies.

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
And felt your heart beat close to mine
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command.

The first time ever I lay with you
I felt the earth move in my hand
I thought our joy would fill the earth
And last 'till the end of time, my love,
And last

// Mother Nature //

Go on and take your course
And a-take me with you
Hey, I wanna leave here, oh

Mother Nature
Take the chains off me
As long as I'm livin', livin'
Hey, I wanna be free, hey

Come on and let your sweet wine
Rush to my head
And make me feel fine

Let me stand naked in the sun
Hiding from no one
Hey, hey, hey

Mother Nature
Come on and do your thing
I want to start feeling, hey
All those good things you can bring
Hey, hey

Day in, day out I learn to find
Leaves me half alive
And I'm going nowhere
I can't live in this classic world
It's killing me
Can't you see
You're the only one to turn to

Mother Nature
Go on and take your course
But take me with you, with you
Hey, I wanna leave here

Mother, I wanna leave here
Oh, Mother

// Do Your Thing //

It's your thing 
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you 
Who to sock it to

It's your thing 
Do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you 
Who to sock it to

If you want me to love you, maybe I will
I need you woman, it ain't no big deal
You need love now, just as bad as I do
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you 
Who to sock it to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you 
Who to sock it to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you 
Who to sock it to

I'm not trying to run your life,
I know you wanna do what's right,
Ah, give your love girl, do whatever you choose,
How can you lose, with the stuff you use?

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you 
Who to sock it to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
Don't let me tell you 
Who to sock it to

Let me hear you say it's my thing (It's your thing),
I do what I wanna do...
