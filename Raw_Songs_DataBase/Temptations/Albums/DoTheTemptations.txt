// Why Can't You And Me Get Together //

Why can't we get together?
Why can't we get together?
Why can't we get together?
Why can't we get together?

You and me!

Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together?

It seems I see you everywhere I go
At the beach, the show, and even at the disco
But every time I get close to you
You get away, oh, yes you do

So I came to the tennis court
Because I heard that you love the sport
Why can't you?

Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together?
You and me!

Tennis court, I don't know the sport
The game I came to play is of a different sort
But if I have to play to get next to you
I brought a racket and two brand new tennis shoes

See what you made me do for you
Now won't you let me get next to you!

Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together?

Why can't we get together?
Why can't we get together?
Why can't we get together?
You and me!

Now there's a method to my madness
And the crazy way that I come on
You look so good so I, I had to meet ya
Just to let you know where I'm coming from

The tennis court is a funny place to start
I came to let you know you've captured my heart!

Why can't you and me get together? (Right now baby!)
What I want to know is
Why can't you and me get together? (A-right now! A-right now! Now! Now!)
What I want to know is
Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together? (You and me!)

Why can't you, and me, together
Why can't you, and me, together
Why can't you, and me, together...

// I'm On Fire (Body Song) //

(I'm on fire) I'm on fire
(Ooh ooh ooh)

(I'm on fire) for you

I look at you
And I get hot all over
'Cause
You got me burnin' for you

(I'm on fire) Fire! Oh oh!
Baby!

(I'm on fire) for you

(I hold you in my arms)
(My love rises to the stars)

'Cause you got me burning for you

Let me touch you
Everywhere I want to

'Cause I can't wait no longer
This feeling keeps getting stronger!
Baby baby
Let me have you (got me burning)
My whole (my body's yearning for you)

I'm burning
I'm yearning
Oh
I'm needing you
Oh baby, you've got me tasting

(Give me some!) I'm on fire
Baby!
(I'm on fire) You've got me burning
Got me yearning
Baby please

(I hold you in my arms)
(My love rises to the stars)
'Cause you got me burning
My whole body's yearning for you

Baby
Oh, baby (for you)

(I'm on fire) I'm so hot for your body, baby
Yeah

(I'm on fire) The way you walk
And when you talk ooh, such sweet body language
(I'm on fire) The nearness of you, I get misty blue

I'm on fire...

// Put Your Trust In Me Baby //

Once upon a time
You filled my life and now you're gone
But life will go on
I find myself still holding on

To a dream that you'll come back
I can't accept that you have gone
(Whichever way I turn)
I still see you in my mind

I can't stand (I can't stand it)
Being all alone (I can't stand it)
You're my chosen one (I can't stand it)
Can't you see what you've done
You got my heart on the run

Oh baby, can't you see?
You can put your trust in me
I know that (I know, I know)
You'll find that hard to believe

When (when will I learn?)
That wanting love won't make love mine
Your love I've tried to earn
And though I've failed my heart still yearns
This emptiness my heart can't stand (baby)
Without your love, I'm half a man 'cause

(In bed) I toss and I turn
'Cause I need you in the night!

(Put your trust in me baby!)
Baby, baby!
(Put your trust in me baby)
I can't stand being alone!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Girl, I want you for my own!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Put your trust in me baby!

I can't stand being all alone
You're my chosen one
Can't you see what you've done
You got my heart on the one for you, baby
(Baby, can't you see?)
You can put all your trust in me (I got to say that)
I know (I know! I know!)
You'll find that hard to believe!

Baby! Baby!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Without you baby I can't go on!
(Put your trust in me baby)
I'll hold on to your love!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Put your trust in me baby!
(Put your trust in me)

Little girl, what am I gonna do?
I've realized I don't have you
(Do, do, doo)
You are the girl that can make my life
You're the girl I want to make my wife
Put your trust in me baby!
Put your trust in me baby!
There ain't no limit to the things I wouldn't do
Trust in me like I trust in you!

(Put your trust in me baby)
I'm begging you baby!
(Put your trust in me baby)
I'm down on my bended knees!
(Put your trust in me baby)

// Let Me Count The Ways (I Love You) //

There's so many ways
That I want to say
I love you
Yes (one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
Let me count the ways
That I wanna say
I love you

(Number two) When you talk, you sound so sexy
(Number three) You wear such lovely perfume!
(Number four) You're as sweet as candy
(Number five) And you give so much strength to me
(Number six) How complete, baby, you understand me

All the fellas in the world
Wish they had a special girl
Just like you, mama
But that could never ever be
'Cause you know you belong to me
I love you, yes

If you
Should ever leave me, little girl
I know
I would just die!

Oh! (I love you)
Yes I do (I love you)
You know it's true (I love you)
Hey hey! (Oh! I love you)
