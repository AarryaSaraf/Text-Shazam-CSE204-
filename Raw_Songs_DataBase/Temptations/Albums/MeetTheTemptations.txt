// May I Have This Dance //

May i have this dance
i've been waitin for this chance
all night long (all night long)
and this night i'll always treasure
if i could have the pleasure
to excort you
dont you know i've bit my nails in to
wantin to dance with you
but i was much too shy
i never had the nerve
before you'd dance across the floor with another guy
the way he held you in his arms
with his many charms
i knew my chances were slim
in order to get to you
there's only one thing to do
so i got rid of him
hey
ooh hoo i told him that a girl
by the name of pearl
was looking for him
and when i turned around
he was nowhere to be found
so here i am
ooh i gotta have this dance (gotta have this dance with you)
honey i (gotta have this dance with you)
honey i, honey i, honey i, have this dance
honey i (gotta have this dance with you)
gotta have this dance
oh...

// The Further You Look, The Less You See //

Many a man has gone away
Many a man has gone astray
Searching for the treasures of a love that's true
I'm hoping that my treasure can be you
Cause I believe, I believe

The further you look
Show love now
The less you see
I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me

I've seen men carry their hopes from town to town
Trying to track lost treasures down
Some find true love before their hopes are gone
Others lose hope and they have to --yes, now -- move on
And I can hear them say as they go down

The further you look,
You better know that
The less you see
So I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me

Oh-oh-oohhh-oh
Travel, travelling on
Wondering if they've done something wrong
Moving on becoming a rover
But if you'll be mine, my searching is all over because now

The further you look,
Show love now
The less you see
I'm hoping you'll be the treasure meant for me

And I know, I know, I know
The further you look,
the less you're gonna see
so I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me

And I believe, I believe right now
The further you look,
the less you're gonna see
so I'm hoping you'll be the treasure meant for me

// Check Yourself //

[Otis (& then Melvin - spoken)]
By and by, you knew that you make me cry. (By and by, knew you'd make me cry)
And my love for you will never die. (My love will never, never die)
But I had to find out on my own.

(Check yourself, check yourself)

[Paul:]
Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I paid no mind. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I kept on breaking hearts, (Check yourself, check yourself)
All down the line. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Sometimes you just got to lose.
That's when you pay your dues.
I guess I was a fool, I guess I was a fool,
To think that... you'd stayed so true.

Aww, I really played in the game. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'd always win. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Now the tables turn. (Check yourself, check yourself)
And I'm on the losing end. (Check yourself, check yourself)

Oh don't, feel sorry.
I had it coming, it's true.
'Cause I'm losing, yes, I'm losing, I'm losing you.

Before I go, I'd like for you to know.
You've had my heart from the very start.
But there's one more thing, before we part.
And that's I'm sorry, sorry, sorry to my heart.

Aww, I'm on my sad way. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Because I know I'd lost your love. (Check yourself, check yourself)
I'll kick it, like a pass. (Check yourself, check yourself)

But I'll be thinking of....
The good times. (The good times)
The bad times. (The bad times)
But good or bad, happy or sad,
Of memories. (Memories)
Sweet, sweet memories. (Memories)
Aww, memories... are all I have.

Aww, that's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
That's what they... what they told me. (Check yourself, check yourself)
Hmmm...

// Slow Down Heart //

Slow down heart, you're beating much too fast.
Why don't you, slow down heart
As she goes walking, past you
When I first saw you (hey) my heart stood still (hey)
Down my spine, (hey) I felt cold chills (hey)
My head started spinning, my knees got weak.
Aw, I couldn't even speak.
When my heart started pounding, (heart started pounding, like a)
Like a, mallet of a judge.
I couldn't budge (I couldn't budge)
I couldn't budge (I couldn't budge)
I couldn't budge (I couldn't budge)

So I said, slow down heart,
A, Slow down a heart...
You're beating much too fast.
You know that you're beating too fast...
Slow down heart
As she goes walking... past you

Hey, Hey, Hey...

Everyday I wait outside my door.(hey)
(Hey) Hoping you'll come by just once more (hey)
That's when in a distance I can see it's you
Aw, what could I do oo,
When my heart started pounding, (heart started pounding)
Like a, thousand drums 
Here she comes (oh here she comes)
Oh, here she comes (oh here she, comes)
Oh, here she comes (oh here, she comes)

So I said, slow down heart,
Slow down heart…
You're beating much too fast.
You know that you're beating too fast...
Slow down heart
As she goes walking, past you
Why don't you, slow down heart...

I'm gonna cry, (gonna cry) my love. (My love)

The vow of love you broken.
The law of love has spoken....
Eddie: to you.

[Paul:]
Oh, why couldn't you be true? (Why couldn't you be true?)
Why couldn't you be true? (Why couldn't you be true?)

[Paul:]
So long, baby. You know, it's so hard...
It's really hard to find someone in this wide world, who's really true.
I guess it's just meant for me to be unhappy.
But I believe, I really do believe that somewhere someone is waiting for me.

[Eddie:]
Aww, she's there, (she's there) my love. (My love)
Somewhere, (somewhere) my love. (My love)

Someone who cares.
And still be there...
Eddie: with me.

How wonderful it would be, yeah. (Boo-oo)

Farewell, to you.
Farewell, my love.

Through.

// Romance Without Finance //

No I'm not the type of girl to say
Baby, if you wanna play you pay
No way, I'm not that kind
Oh yeah, I've got love on my mind
Down in the quarter
Out on the corner, walkin' the line
They say romance without finance
That's a crime

Mercy me, heavens above!
What's money got to do with love?
I need a squeeze without a doubt
Won't put my hold on your bank account
I need a lover
Under the cover of the night
And if it's romance without finance
That's all right

Let us give you some free advice
Say that love must have its price
Can't you see girl, you're wastin' your time
That boy, he ain't got a dime

They don't know if your love is true
They don't see what I see in you
You got a touch, feelin' so fine
I don't care about your bottom line

Down in the quarter
Almighty dollar's on their minds
But I'll take romance over finance
Every time

I don't care what your daddy do
I don't care if your blood is blue
Legal tender's bringin' me down
It ain't what makes my world go round

I need a lover
Seens me some tender eyes that shine
I'll take my romance over finance
Every time

Romance without finance
And I'll take romance over finance
Every time
