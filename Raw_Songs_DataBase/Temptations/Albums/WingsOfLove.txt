Album: WingsOfLove

// Paradise //

Paradise, it's being here with you
Close to your heart
Oh, the sweet harmony, is beautiful

Tenderly, you receive my love
I release myself and we are one
Flowing deep, like a river
You rejoice inside, and we are one

In your eyes
I see an open door 
That leads straight to your heart
All the way to your soul, it's beautiful

Paradise

A picture is worth a thousand words
A feeling is worth it more and more

Flowing deep, like a river
you rejoice inside, and we are one

Paradise, it's being here with you
Close to your heart
Oh, the sweet harmony, is beautiful

// Mary Ann //

I'm on a big ship
On the high waves [?] of time
I've followed every dream in life
That ever crossed my mind
Beyond each horizon
I find less that I left behind

Oh, how I miss you, Mary Ann
I'd love to taste your love again
My sail's awaiting for the wind

Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!
Mary! Ann!

Out in the sea of doubt
I weathered every storm
I'm the captain of my ship
A sailor, I was born
I've had queens in castles
On clouds in the sky

But my heart sent to you, Mary Ann
My mind's on coming home again
My sail's awaiting for the wind

Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!
Mary! Ann!

I'd like to imagine you on the shores at dawn
And you, oh my pretty one, gentle as a fawn
And as I row my boat ashore
My dream is that we go home baby

Oh how I miss you Mary Ann
I'd love to be back home again
My sail's awaiting for the wind

Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!
Mary! Ann!

// Dream World (Wings Of Love) //

When morning comes and finds me
I'll be living in a dream
The sun will be shining
Everything smiling with me

Tonight I lay here in your arms
Beside your naked skin
Oh, what a feeling
Starting to flow out of me

Girl, we paint a pretty picture
In a pretty room
On a pretty bed
And the things you say!

It's like I'm living in a dream world, baby
Far away from the pains of reality
Moving gently through the twilight, lady
You've got me flying up high on wings of love
Oh baby, wings of love

It's like I'm living in a dream world, baby
Far away from the pains of reality
Moving gently through the twilight, lady
You've got me flying up high on wings of love

Inside your arms, close to your heart
That's where I want to stay
The pleasure you give me
Is more than these words I can say

All the world and all this gold
Can't buy this way I feel
A treasure forever
And diamonds don't sparkle like love

'Cause you gave to me a feeling
That has changed my life
That has changed my mind
When you gave me love, yeah!

It's like I'm living in a dream world, baby
Far away from the pains of reality
Moving gently through the twilight, lady
You've got me flying up high on wings of love
Oh baby, wings of love

It's like I'm living in a dream world, baby
Far away from the pains of reality
Moving gently through the twilight, lady
You've got me flying up high on wings of love

You've got me dreaming
You've got me dreaming
You've got me dreaming all the time
[repeat till the end]
