// It's Summer //

Outside my window a robin builds a nest.
At last winter's gone away to rest.
Once again the leaves has return to the trees.
I can just feel that soft summer breeze.

There's magic in the air.
Winter disappear, it's summer.

Children will be playing in the park.
Days will be longer till the dark
Nights will be warm with star filled skies.
A perfect setting for a girl and a guy.

There's magic in the air.
Green grass every-everywhere.
It's summer.

[Instrumental]

Don't you know it's summer time... (Time) (Time) (Time)
And the livin' is easy. Oh, so easy.
Everybody sing summer time... (Time) (Time) (Time)
Now that summer's here there be million things to do.
Vacation near or far, whatever pleases you.
[Melvin:] Summer is the happiest season of them all.
So everybody get together and have yourselves a ball.

There's magic in the air.
Green grass every-everywhere.
It's summer.
Oh

There's magic in the air.
Green grass every-everywhere.
It's summer.
Woo

It's summer time. (Magic in the air, green grass everywhere)
Oh, it's summer.
Take a look around you.
It's summer time. (Magic in the air, green grass everywhere)
Oh, it's summer.
Hmm
It's summer time.

// Take A Look Around //

Feather in your cap if you catch a robber,
Dirt in your face if your scheme falls through
Pay close attention to my story
Youll find every word is true.
Junk man standing on the corner
Selling death, no concience has he.
In the name of God, wont somebody stop him
stop him, think about the children
Its a matter of life and death, you see.
Aint no time to stand back and point your finger,
Weve got to face reality.
No, no, no, no, no...
Dont turn your back on this problem, people,
too much depends on you and me.
Desprate with no sense of value,
just an evil mind lurking through the night.
Because of you, the streets aint safe no more for walking,
cause youre feeling so up-tight.
Take a look around

// Ain't No Sunshine //

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
It's not warm when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away.

Wonder this time where she's gone,
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away.

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know

Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone,
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
Only darkness everyday.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.

Knock on my door, it's a letter from the war
Saying, "Greetings, we want you"
If I refuse to fight they say that ain't right
And time you'll have to do
Somebody please tell me what is war all about?
Why must I kill against my will?
I just can't figure it out
Oh oh oh oh

Does anybody give a damn, yeah
About the men in Vietnam?
Why don't you stop the war right now?
Oh oh oh oh, stop the war (Right now)

Think about all the soldiers
That are dead and gone today
If you'd ask them to fight again
What do you think they'd say?
I'm not trying to be funny
I'm just trying to get a point across
War is world's enemy #1
And it's time that we called it off
Oh oh oh oh

Does anybody give a damn, damn
About the men in Vietnam?
Why don't you stop the war, hey hey, right now?
Oh oh oh oh, stop the war, war, right now (Right now)

More casualties pile up each day
Cemeteries are overflowing
The leaders of the world claim peace is near
But the death list keeps on growin'
And what does a mother get in return
For the life of the son she's lost?
A few measly pennies a month
A medal, a grave, and a doggone cost

Does anybody give a damn, damn
About the men in Vietnam?
Why don't you stop the war, oh oh, right now?
Oh oh oh oh, stop the war, war, right now (Right now)

(Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Sing it, sing it, sing it
Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Everybody sing it
Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Sing it to my brother, now
Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Listen, listen, listen, listen (Woo))

// Smooth Sailing (From Now On) //

Sunny days, good weather
You and me, forever and ever
Those were your favorite lines
But I found out you were cheating and lying

There'll be no looking back
'Cause this time I'm on the right track
I done made up my mind
Leaving you behind

Smooth sailing, from now on...right on!

Now let me tell you somethin'

Girl, your love is just like the weather — changing all the time
My leaving you might not mean a thing, it's true
At least I'll have peace of mind

Let me tell you there'll be no looking back
'Cause this time I'm on the right track
'Cause I done made up my mind
I'm leaving you behind

Smooth sailing, from now on...right on!

I'm gone
So long
(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

Sooner or later — maybe never — I'll probably want you back
One thing you can be sure of, between me and you there ain't no love
And that's a natural fact (Yeah)

There'll be no looking back
'Cause this time I'm on the right track
'Cause I done made up my mind
I'm leaving you behind

Smooth sailing, from now on...right on!
(I'm talking about smooth) Smooth sailing, from now on...right on!
(I'm gone)
Smooth sailing, from now on...right on!
(I'm talking about smooth) Smooth sailing, from now on...right on!

// Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are) //

Higher, higher
Fire

Don't change your style now that you've reached the top
Don't choose your friends by what they've got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people you're just a human being

Superstar, good God
Enjoy your champagne and caviar
And your chauffeur drivin' fancy car
But remember how you got where you are
Oh ho ho, 'cause the same folks that made you
Um hum, you better believe they can break you

No you didn't make it all by yourself
You had help from somebody else
The truth is the light, don't let it depress you
You just be thankful that the good Lord made you

Superstar, ah do you know who your real friends are
Ah, talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you are
Ah ah down, down, down, down

Drummer keep it going, going
Horns star blowin', right on time blow my mind
Blow my mind
Higher higher, higher higher

It's easy for you to look down
Turn up your nose and frown
Now that you're on top
Top

Bright lights
Don't let the bright lights blind you
Bridge
Don't burn 'em behind you

Superstar, superstar do you know who your real friends are
Ah, talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you are
Um hum, um hum

Don't change your style now that you've reached the top
Don't choose your friends by what they've got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people you're just a human being

Superstar, superstar do you know who your real friends are
Ah, talkin' to you
Superstar remember how you got where you are

// The End Of Our Road //

Well, well, well...
I gotta get away from you, girl, as fast as I can
Too much for me, woman
More than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You've been reckless with my heart
If I stayed around
You'd surely tear it all apart

The road has got to end somewhere
Woman, woman, every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road

Oh, I'm thinkin' 'bout all those times you left me at home lonely
You only did it 'cause you knew I love you only
Runnin', runnin' around with every guy in town
I'm tellin' you, woman, no longer will I be your clown

Said the road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
I'm sick and tired of your stuff
Said enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sho'nuff, lady, I just got to...

Woman, there's no sense in you beggin' and pleadin'
Talkin' 'bout I'm the one you're leavin'
Said I done had my fill of you
Girl, you've cut me so through the years
I done sho'nuff ran out of tears
I couldn't cry if I wanted to

Said the road has got to end somewhere, honey honey
Every road has got to end somewhere
Time and again I've begged you to slow down
So I'm givin' you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road, road, road, road, road

(This is the end of our road)
I, I can't take it no more
(This is the end of our road)
Packin' up my clothes, walk out the door
(This is the end of our road)
I, I can't take it no more
(This is the end of our road)
Packin' up my clothes, walking out the door...
