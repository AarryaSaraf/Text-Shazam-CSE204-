"I need some pencils
Will you be using 'em for company business?
One eight hundred nine nine two
For cash back, see store for details"

Meeting rebel leaders, he says
He also plans to thank Russian soldiers
For their work in Chechnya
Work better

People around here are driving me crazy
Watching them run is making me lazy
Trying to buy a place in my head

Selling me lines I've already read
Speaking my name to try to confuse me
Say it again you're starting to lose me

That's alright, I'm okay
It happens every single day
It's all the same but I'm not blind

Never mind, it's either you or me
And I can't see the difference
You or me, I find that I can't see the difference

When are these changes going to stick
Eating my words is making me sick
Some of the time I'm practically sacred

Reading my mind is leaving you naked
You'd rather give it away than receive it
One of these days I'm gonna believe it

That's alright, I'm okay
It happens every single day
It's all the same butI'm not blind

Never mind, it's either you or me
And I can't see the difference
You or me, I find that I can't see the difference

You or me and I can't see the difference
You or me, I find that I can't see the difference
You or me

That's alright, I'm okay
It happens every single day
And I can't see the difference
It's all the same but I'm not blind

Never mind, it's either you or me
That's alright I'm okay
It happens every single day

I find that I can't see the difference
It's all the same but I'm not blind

My position was that if anybody who's a Christian would go there
They're not only aligning themselves to the demagogue
They're aligning themselves to the Antichrist
Which by the way, this man is an Antichrist

Did you see the video?
I didn't need to see the video to call the guy an Antichrist
If you can truly appreciate sins
So that we'll go to heaven anyway
He came to save his people from their sins
