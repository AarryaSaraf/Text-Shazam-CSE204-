The evening stars shine brightly
Over Heaven's Cove
As night descends in silence
The fated scene unfolds
Consumed with trepidation
Arhys hears his brother's voice


As you're facing the path that divides
I will always be here by your side


I feel my pulse begin to race
Beads of sweat drip down my face
I have made a grave mistake
What have I done?
My blood for my son?

It's not too late!
I won't betray him!


I knew the day had come
And you could be tempted
To give up the Chosen One
And finally end this
Do anything for your son
A terminal weakness
Now you're as good as done


I didn't have a choice
And I was defenseless
I didn't believe his voice
And fighting was senseless
But now I can see the truth
I've come to my senses
I shouldn't have trusted you


Arhys was never aware
His son had followed him there
Confused and deathly afraid
X watched his hero be brave


On the path that divides
You were there by my side
There will be no betrayal tonight!

I found courage and strength
In the words you once sang
Tore the truth from the lies
On the path that divides


You dare defy your prince?
Well, you just threw your life away
Along with Xander's dreams
You chose the wrong man to betray!


Two hungry warriors
Clash in the shadows of the night
But that's the cost with every fight
And Arhys' fight for hope
Cost him his very life
