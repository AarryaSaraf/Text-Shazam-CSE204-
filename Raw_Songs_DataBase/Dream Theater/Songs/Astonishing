Brother, can you hear me?
His life is in your hands
He is just a child and still too young to understand
Show him love and courage
That freedom knows no bounds
Tell him he could never let me down


Father
I will make you proud
Rest in peace


I always had the answer
All this time I held the key
And now that I see
The reason to believe
I can be the man who I am meant to be


Because of you, I live again
Now I can be a voice for change
And help to build a world that's fair and true
So they can live the life they never knew


On the road to revolution
There are lessons to be learned
All the things you thought that mattered
Are lost at every turn
When the light of my existence
Was slipping through my hands
Pride and ignorance receded
To reveal a humbled man


My prince, my son
You got lost along the way
In light of this new burden that you face
You are forgiven on this day


People, can you hear us?
Peace has been restored
The silence has been broken
Music reigns for evermore
We sing a song of freedom
Together we are bound
People, we shall never hold you down
We will build our world on common ground
And we'll live once more
Eternally
In harmony
Our lives will be
Astonishing
Again
