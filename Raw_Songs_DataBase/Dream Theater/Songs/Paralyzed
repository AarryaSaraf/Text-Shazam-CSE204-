The anger, the pressure, you're choking down
Your words again, feel the nerves set in
Unspoken frustration, they see right through you
Paper thin, like the ghost within

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed

The stare of a stranger, is like a wound
That bleeds again, silent as the dead
The victim, the martyr, like Daniel
In the Lion's Den, time and time again

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Relentless mental drain
What do you stand to gain?
Viewing life through such a narrow, fractured lens
Will ensure you end up on the losing end
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
