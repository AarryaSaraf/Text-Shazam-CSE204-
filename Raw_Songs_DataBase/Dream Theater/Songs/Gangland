Shadows may hide you but also be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for the daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile

Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die

Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long 'til they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive

Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone but alive for how long?

Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die

Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die

Dead men, gangland
Dead men, gangland
Tell no tales
