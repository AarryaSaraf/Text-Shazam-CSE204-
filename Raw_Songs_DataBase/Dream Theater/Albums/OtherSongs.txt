// Metropolis //

The smile of dawn
Arrived early May
She carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear
To tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain
She'll never outgrow

Death is the first dance, eternal

There's no more freedom
The both of you will be confined to this mind

I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire

As a child, I thought I could live without pain, without sorrow
As a man I've found it's all caught up with me
I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid

Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eluding stares from faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again

Deceit is the second without end

The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive

The third arrives

Before the leaves have fallen
Before we lock the doors
There must be the third and last dance
This one will last forever
Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles
She's taken you to your home

It can only take place
When the struggle between our children has ended
Now the Miracle and the Sleeper know that the third is love

Love is the Dance of Eternity

// The Spirit Carries On //

Where did we come from?
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyond
And what lay before?
Is anything certain in life?

They say "Life is too short"
"The here and the now"
And "You're only given one shot"
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we've got?

If I died tomorrow
I'd be alright
Because I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on

I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the end
But that was before
I'm not scared anymore
I know that my soul will transcend

I may never find all the answers
I may never understand why
I may never prove
What I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try

If I died tomorrow
I'd be alright
Because I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on

"Move on, be brave
Don't weep at my grave
Because I'm no longer here
But please never let
Your memory of me disappear!"

Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My questioning mind
Has helped me to find
The meaning in my life again
Victoria's real
I finally feel
At peace with the girl in my dreams
And now that I'm here
It's perfectly clear
I found out what all of this means

If I died tomorrow
I'd be alright
Because I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on

// You Or Me //

"I need some pencils
Will you be using 'em for company business?
One eight hundred nine nine two
For cash back, see store for details"

Meeting rebel leaders, he says
He also plans to thank Russian soldiers
For their work in Chechnya
Work better

People around here are driving me crazy
Watching them run is making me lazy
Trying to buy a place in my head

Selling me lines I've already read
Speaking my name to try to confuse me
Say it again you're starting to lose me

That's alright, I'm okay
It happens every single day
It's all the same but I'm not blind

Never mind, it's either you or me
And I can't see the difference
You or me, I find that I can't see the difference

When are these changes going to stick
Eating my words is making me sick
Some of the time I'm practically sacred

Reading my mind is leaving you naked
You'd rather give it away than receive it
One of these days I'm gonna believe it

That's alright, I'm okay
It happens every single day
It's all the same butI'm not blind

Never mind, it's either you or me
And I can't see the difference
You or me, I find that I can't see the difference

You or me and I can't see the difference
You or me, I find that I can't see the difference
You or me

That's alright, I'm okay
It happens every single day
And I can't see the difference
It's all the same but I'm not blind

Never mind, it's either you or me
That's alright I'm okay
It happens every single day

I find that I can't see the difference
It's all the same but I'm not blind

My position was that if anybody who's a Christian would go there
They're not only aligning themselves to the demagogue
They're aligning themselves to the Antichrist
Which by the way, this man is an Antichrist

Did you see the video?
I didn't need to see the video to call the guy an Antichrist
If you can truly appreciate sins
So that we'll go to heaven anyway
He came to save his people from their sins
