Album: AViewFromTheTopOfTheWorld

// The Alien //

Look beyond the Earth, heading set for the stars
Interplanetary, some are near, some are far
Terraform a new world, survival for mankind
Options but a few, we are running out of time

Should you climb aboard
A voyage, the first of its kind
Ready to explore
All that you've known left behind

Our Holy Grail
Now redefined
Our purpose, a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand
Life beyond here, digital man

Alien, changed forever
New found world in the stars

Understand the meaning
Certain we'll extend the scale of consciousness
Woman, child and man
Multi planet species out amongst the stars
Not stuck in and around who and what we are

Time to climb aboard
Countdown to takeoff on time
Systems are online (5, 4, 3, 2)
Farewell to all humankind (1)

Our Holy Grail
Clearly defined
Our purpose, a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand
Life beyond here
Digital man

Alien, changed forever
New found world, here we are

Our Holy Grail
Clearly defined
Our purpose a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand

Our Holy Grail
Read between the lines
One purpose, one thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand

I am the alien
Out here in the stars
We'll search till we find
No matter how far
A far better world
For all human race
And beyond

// Answering The Call //

White walls glisten
Empires, crimson
Aching within
Raging fire
Sovereign, asphyxiate
No conscience
A solemn state
Misguide, indoctrinate
Accepted long held views

When will there be a day when all of us
Trust in love and peace?
Burns bright for us
When will the long-held truth be cast aside?
Embrace our fellow man, no longer vilified

Radiant we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Illuminating all
Answering the call

Decisions by which to act
Programmed, no turning back
Call upon a switch turned on
An ultimate price to pay
Weeping mother, too late to cry
Hold the truth, can't ignore the lie
Time to look it in the eye

When will there be a day when all of us
Trust and know in love and peace?
When will the long held truth be cast aside?
Embrace our fellow man, no longer vilified

Radiant we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Illuminating all
Answering the call

Fight or flight, both threatening
Hidden thoughts are deafening
Your guilt feeding the flame
Tearful knowing it's a lie
Zion might just past you by
Rituals your funeral pyre
Scars you can't erase
If you choose to face
There is beauty in us all
Walk the higher ground
There you will be found
The writing's on the wall
Will you wager your life?

Radiant we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Walk the higher ground
There you will be found
Illuminating all
Answering the call
Answering the call

// Invisible Monster //

When you face the creature
That waits beneath your bed
Will you stare into its eyes or look away?

Running toward the fire
Or fleeing from the flame
The choice to seek or hide is yours to make

The serpent inside
Wrapping its tail around my neck
I'm buried alive
Dying to take another breath

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave
Invisible monster

Hiding, never showing its face
Feeding on irrational fear
Thoughts race at a feverish pace
Soaring on a flight of ideas

Perched on its victim's shoulder
Whispering in its ear
Things that may never happen
Worries too much to bear

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave
Invisible monster

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave

Invisible monster
Beast that dwells inside my mind
Give up your hold let me take back control
Invisible monster
Invisible monster

// Sleeping Giant //

Some will be driven by conflict
Others will fight the good fight
Some will rely on the darkness
Some will rely on the light

Some elevate with compassion
Yearning for knowledge and peace
Some motivate through aggression
And selfishly serve their own needs

Shadows disappear at night
Buried out of fear
Driven underground

Hidden lies the rage inside
Like a ticking bomb
That doesn't make a sound

People will obsess
With suffering and death
Questioning their own desires

This morbid fascination
Renders us possessed
By our violent and destructive side

When we lay our armor down
Fragments of our love
Slip through the cracks of hate

But the raging storm below
Will never go away
If it is not embraced

Shadows disappear at night
Buried out of fear
Driven underground

Hidden lies the rage inside
Like a ticking bomb
That doesn't make a sound

Shadows disappear at night
Harmless as a dove
Clever like a snake

Hidden lies the rage inside
Like a sleeping giant
One we dare not wake

Standing under the eclipse
Are we sheltered and concealed
Or bathing in its glow?

Our desires and ambitions
And our need to believe
There is good in this world
Spin the common thread

// Transcending Time //

Drifting in a far off place
I roam the countryside
Seeking wings of thought
Waiting in the blind

Enchanted and transfixed
I am pulled into the still
By a backward ticking clock
Held against my will

Illusions turn to dust
Scatter to the wind
Like dreaming while awake

Signals in the mist
Altered state of mind
Stars in the abyss
Transcending time

Midnight in the garden
Digging for a spark
Where seeds of inspiration
Lie buried in the dark

Attention starts to wander
As the poet lifts his pen
And the critic from within
Is silenced once again

Limits leave no trace
Ashes in the rain
Lost and far away

Signals in the mist
Altered state of mind
Stars in the abyss
Transcending time

Signals in the mist
Stars in the abyss

Euphoric obsession
Without conscious intention
Being pulled by the current
On a vessel steered by someone else

Transcending time
Transcending time
Transcending time
Transcending time

// Awaken The Master //

Finding your way
On a frozen path where the air is thin
The angel of balance
Keeps you alive

A flower unfolds
A heartbeat brings new meaning to the universe
The angel of balance
Keeps you strong
Discovering what has been all along

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light
Remember hereafter

You made it to the top
Just to find out
You're only halfway there
All along missing the point of the journey

The will of the soul
Like a peak so high
You look inside to rise
Searching out a dream
Climbing, reaching further
And the voices of the angels bring you closer

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light
Remember hereafter

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light

Spinning through life
We balance the heart and the mind

Turning the stone
Embracing the truth that we find

Remember hereafter
The end of a chapter
Awaken the master
Awaken the master

// A View From The Top Of The World //

[I. The Crowning Glory]

The fire that burns within us
To carry out a dream
Chasing new ambitions
Determined to succeed
To stretch beyond our limits
To blaze a brand new trail
Bold enough to conquer
Brave enough to fail

Sheer determination
Taking nerves of steel
Always digging deeper
Danger all too real

To rise above the challenge
To push to the extreme
To the daring, there can be no in-between

See a view from the top of the world
Take a ride on the crest of a wave
The adrenaline rush over and over again
See a view from the top of the world

All my natural instincts
Are begging me to stop
But somehow I carry on
Heading for the top
A physical absurdity
A tremendous mental game
Helping me understand
Exactly who I am

To face a new adventure
To conquer the insane
Lured into madness
Addicted to the pain
Reaching for the summit
On the threshold of defeat
Rightfully joining
The ranks of the elite

See a view from the top of the world
Feel the wind on the edge of the sky
Take a chance you may die, over and over again
See a view from the top of the world

[II. Rapture Of The Deep]

I begin the blind descent
To a place no one has seen
Returning to the womb
On the fringe of the unknown
A journey into darkness beckons me

Like a blind man in a maze
Who somehow finds an open door
The beauty and the danger
And the yearning to explore
Always keeps me coming back for more

[III. The Driving Force]

The moment that you recognize
Just where your limits lie
Hanging on the brink of death
You're never more alive
When you reach the pinnacle
The world is at your feet
Welcome to the mind unleashed
The impossible is never out of reach
When barriers are broken, greatness is achieved
Self belief will build a life of legacy
