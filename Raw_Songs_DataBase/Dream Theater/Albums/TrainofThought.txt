// As I Am //

Don't tell me what's in, tell me how to write
Don't tell me how to win
This fight isn't your life, it isn't your right
To take the only thing that's mine
Proven over time, it's over your head
Don't try to read between the
Lines are clearly defined!
"Never lose sight of something you believe in"

Taking in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog!

I've been trying to justify you
In the end I will just defy you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am!
As I am!

Still running uphill, swimming against the current
I wish I weren't so fucked
Feels like I'm stuck
Lost in a sea of mediocrity
"Slow down! You're thinking too much. Where is your soul?"
You cannot touch the way I play
Or tell me what to say
You're in the way of all that I believe in

Taking in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog!

I've been wasting my breath on you
Open minds will descend upon you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am!

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am!
As I am!

// This Dying Soul //

[IV. Reflections of Reality (Revisited)]

[Instrumental]

Hello, mirror â€“ so glad to see you my friend, it's been a while
Searching, fearless, where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial?

Face yourself, man!
Brace yourself and trace your hell back

You've been blinded, living like a one-way cold existence all the while!
Now it's time to stare the problem right between the eyes, you long lost child!

I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking, and shaking
And left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making
A change to fix this dying soul, this dying soul
This dying soul!

Born into this world a broken home
Surrounded by love yet all alone
Forced into a life that's split in two
A mother and a father both pulling you

Then you had to deal with loss and death
Everybody thinking they know best
Coping with this shit at such an age
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage

Family disease pumped through your blood
Never had the chance you thought you could
Running all the while with no escape
Turning all that pain into blame and hate

Living on your own by twenty-one
Not a single care and having fun
Consuming all the life in front of you
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue

Possessive obsessions, selfish childish games
Vengeful resentments, passing all the blame

Living out a life of decadence
Acting without thought of consequence
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast
While spitting on the ones that matter most

Running power mad with no control
Fighting for the credit they once stole
No one can ever tell you what to do
Ruling other's lives while they can't stand the thought of you!

A living reflection seen from miles away
A hopeless affliction having run astray

I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking, and shaking
And left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making
A change to fix this dying soul, this dying soul
This dying soul!

Now that you can see all you have done
It's time to take that step into the kingdom
All your sins will only make you strong
And help you break right through the prison wall

[V. Release]

Come to me my friend (listen to me)
I'll help this torture end (help to set me free)
Let your ego go (I can't carry this load)
You can't go through this alone (I feel so hopeless and exposed)

You'll find your peace of mind (give me some direction)
You can no longer hide (break out of this isolation)
Let humility (openness, honesty)
And become what you can be (a healing tranquility)

Help me
Save me
Heal me
I can't break out of this prison all alone

These tormenting ghosts of yesterday
Will vanish when exposed
You can't hold onto your secrets
They'll only send you back alone

Your fearless admissions
Will help expel your destructive obsessions
With my help I know you can
Be at one with god and man

Hear me
Believe me
Take me
I'm ready to break through this prison wall

// Endless Sacrifice //

Cold
Lying in my bed
Staring into darkness

Lost
I hear footsteps overhead
And my thoughts return
Again

Like a child who's run away
And won't be coming back
Time keeps passing by
As night turns into day

I'm so far away
And so alone
I need to see your face
To keep me sane
To make me whole

Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind
Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice

Pain
It saddens me to know
The helplessness you feel
Your light
Shines on my soul
While a thousand candles
Burn

Outside this barren room
The rain is pouring down
The emptiness inside
Is growing deeper still

You're so far away
And so alone
You long for love's embrace
To keep you sane
To make you whole

Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind

Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

Over the distance
We try to make sense
Of surviving together
While living apart

Striving for balance
We rise to the challenge
Of staying connected
In spite of circumstance

All you've forsaken
And all that you've done
So that I could live out
This undying dream

Won't be forgotten
Or taken for granted
I'll always remember
Your endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

// Honor Thy Father //

We're taught unconditional love
That blood is thicker than water
That a parent's world would revolve
Always around their son or their daughter
You pretended I was your own
And even believed that you loved me
But were always threatened by some
Invisible blood line that only you could see

You took advantage of an outreached hand
And twisted it to meet your every need
"Gimme time to re-charge my batteries
I'll see her when she's older and I'll bounce her on my knee"
Well listen to me you ungrateful fool
Here comes a dose of reality!
You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man
The door is now closed on your pathetic little plan

On and on and on and on it goes
It's so easy to run away with nothing in tow

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the nerve to blame this mess on me?
Never in my life have I seen someone
So ignorant to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree
Yeah

I tried your 4 bill therapy
I tried to make amends
But nothing could lure you out of your selfish shell again

Expecting everyone to bow and kiss your feet
Don't you see respect is not a one way street?
Blaming everyone for all that you've done wrong
I'll get my peace of mind when you hear this song

On and on and on and on it goes
And with every passing day true colors show

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the balls to blame this mess on me?
Never in my life have I seen someone
Oblivious to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree
Yeah

Watch where you walk
Don't you dare cross the crooked step
Watch the way you talk
Don't cross the crooked step!

[Films samples:]
"This is a regret that you make."
"We just don't connect."
"This is a regret that you make-"
"I want my family back!"
"-and there's something you take"
"You can't have it. I'm sorry for you, but it's too late...!"
"Mistakes like this... You don't make"
"Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you?"
"You make some... And they'll get to you!"
"You don't love anybody!"
"I gave you money, I gave you a car, I took you in-"
"It's not OK, son!"
"-but don't that mean something?"
"A little..."
"Do I admire people too much?"
"No... You should do better!"
"That disappoints you..."
"God damn regrets!"
"You deserve to die alone for what you've done!!"
"God damn regrets!"
"Don't deny it!"
"You cocksucker, I know you can hear me."
"Don't deny it!"
"I want you to know I hate your fucking guts."
"The biggest regret in my life!"
"I wish you'd fucking die."
"I let my love go!"
"I'm your blood... I'm your family"
"Is that you?"
"You're not my family, not anymore"
"The fucking regrets!"
"When your own flesh and blood renounces you..."
"What did I do?"
"...you have no choice but to renounce them."
"What did I do?!"

On and on and on and on it goes
Chauvinistic, heartless, selfish, cold!

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the balls to blame this shit on me?
Never in my life have I seen someone
So fucking blind to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree
Yeah

// Vacant //

Hey you, hey you
I'm right here!
Conscience fading
Can't get through

Oh Lord
Helpless
Confused

Head swayed
Eyes glazed
And mine teared

She's losing control
What can I do?
Her vacant eyes
Black holes
Am I losing you?

// In The Name Of God //

How can this be?
Why is he the chosen one?
Saint gone astray
With a scepter and a gun

Learn to believe
In the mighty and the strong
Come bleed the beast
Follow me, it won't be long

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Straight is the path
Leading to your salvation
Slaying the weak
Ethnic elimination

Any day we'll all be
Swept away
You'll be saved
As long as you obey

Lies
Tools of the devil inside
Written in holy disguise
Meant to deceive and divide
Us all

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Blurring the lines
Between virtue and sin
They can't tell
Where God ends
And mankind begins
They know no other
Life but this
From the cradle
They are claimed

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Hundreds of believers
Lured into a doomsday cult
All would perish
In the name of God
Self-proclaimed messiah
Led his servants
To their death
Eighty murdered
In the name of God

Forty sons and daughters
Un-consenting plural wives
Perversions
In the name of God

Underground religion
Turning toward
The mainstream light
Blind devotion
In the name of God
Justifying violence
Citing from the holy book
Teaching hatred
In the name of God

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Religious beliefs
Fanatic obsession
Does following faith
Lead us to violence?

Unyielding crusade
Divine revelation
Does following faith
Lead us to violence?

Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
Of his terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
