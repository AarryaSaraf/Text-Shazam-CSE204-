// A Change Of Seasons //

[I. The Crimson Sunrise]

[Instrumental]

[II. Innocence]

I remember a time
My frail, virgin mind
Watched the crimson sunrise
Imagined what it might find
Life was filled with wonder
I felt the warm wind blow
I must explore the boundaries
Transcend the depth of winter's snow

Innocence caressing me
I never felt so young before
There was so much life in me
Still I longed to search for more

But those days are gone now
Changed like a leaf on a tree
Blown away forever
Into the cool autumn breeze
The snow has now fallen
And my sun's not so bright
I struggle to hold on
With the last of my might

In my den of inequity
Viciousness and subtlety
Struggle to ease the pain
Struggle to find the same

Ignorance surrounding me
I've never been so filled with fear
All my life's been drained from me
The end is drawing near

[III. Carpe Diem]

"Carpe diem
Seize the day..."

I'll always remember
The chill of November
The news of the fall, the sounds in the hall
The clock on the wall ticking away!
"Seize the Day!," I heard him say
"Life will not always be this way
Look around, hear the sounds
Cherish your life while you're still around"

("Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
(Old Time is still a-flying;)
(And this same flower that smiles today)
(Tomorrow will be dying")

We can learn from the past
But those days are gone
We can hope for the future
But there may not be one

The words stuck in my mind
Alive from what I've learned
I have to seize the day
To home I returned

Preparing for her flight
I held with all my might
Fearing my deepest fright
She walked into the night
She turned for one last look
She looked me in the eye
I said, "I Love You... Good-bye!"

("It's the most awful thing you'll ever hear;)
(Your mom... who you dearly love...)
(Has had to leave... all our lives")
("Seize the day!")
("Something happened")
("Gather ye rosebuds while ye may")
("She was killed")

[IV. The Darkest Of Winters]

[Instrumental]

[V. Another World]

So far or so it seems
All is lost with nothing fulfilled
Off the pages and the T.V. screen
Another world where nothing's true

Tripping through the life fantastic
Lose a step and never get up
Left alone with a cold blank stare
I feel like giving up

I was blinded by a paradise
Utopia high in the sky
A dream that only drowned me
Deep in sorrow, wondering why

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Then string him up for all the world to see!

I'm sick of all you hypocrites holding me at bay
And I don't need your sympathy to get me through the day
Seasons change and so can I!
Hold on Boy, no time to cry
Untie these strings, I'm climbing down
I won't let them push me away!

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Now it's time for them
To deal with me!

[VI. The Inevitable Summer]

[Instrumental]

[VII. The Crimson Sunset]

I'm much wiser now
A lifetime of memories run through my head
They taught me how
For better or worse
Alive or dead
I realize there's no turning back
Life goes on the offbeaten track

I sit down with my son
Set to see the Crimson Sunset
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
Many years have come and gone
I've lived my life, but now must move on
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
He's my only one
Now that my time has come
Now that my life is done
We look into the sun
"Seize the day and don't you cry
Now it's time to say good-bye
Even though I'll be gone
I will live on
Live on!"

// Funeral For A Friend / Love Lies Bleeding //

The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Is gonna grow and die

Oh it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through

You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
While if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

Oooooh oooh
Oooooh
Oh oh oh oh ooh
Love lies bleeding in my hands
Oooh
Oooh ooh

// Perfect Strangers //

Can you remember
Remember my name
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Ooooh and cold
Cold spirits of ice (ice ice)
All my life
I am the echo of your past

I am returning
The echo of a point in time
In distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Ooooh and laughing
As the spirits appear
Ooooh all your life
Shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers

Oooooh ooh

I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow
Oh

A strand of silver
Hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Ooooh is aching
With the dead of the night
Precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers

// The Rover / Achilles Last Stand / The Song Remains The Same //

[I. The Rover]

[Instrumental]

[II. Achilles Last Stand]

It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turn to you you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Woah the songs to sing
When we at last return again yeah
Oh
Oh

Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
To know the streets the seaman hears
The devil in his hole
Oh to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah
Oh
Ooh

Into the sun the south the north
Lies the first of hope
Shackles of commitment fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd yeah
Oh oooh

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
With guidance from the curving path
That churns up into stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah
Ooooh

Oh

[III. The Song Remains The Same]

Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah
Here we go
Wanted to know, oh oh
Sing out Hare, Hare, oh
Dance the Hoochie Koo
The city lights
Oh so bright
As we go sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding
Through
Oooh
All right

So 'ya
Thought 'ya
Might like to
Go to the show

To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind this cold eyes?
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

Lights...
Roll the sound effects...
Action...
Shout out! (shout out)
Shout out! (shout out)
Shout out! (shout out)

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die

Can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here

[IV. Loving, Touching, Squeezing]

[Originally recorded by Journey]
[Written by Steve Perry]
[From the album "Evolution" - 1979]

You make me weep
And wanna die
Just when
You said we'd try
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other

When I'm alone
Oh by myself
You're out
With someone else
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other

You're tearin' me apart
Every day, every day
You're tearin' me apart
Oh what can I say?
You're tearin' me apart

It won't be long, no
Until you're alone
When you're lover
Oh he hasn't come home
'Cause he's lovin', oh he's touchin', he's squeezin'
Another

He's tearin' you apart
Every day, every day
He's tearin' you apart
Oh girl what can you say?
'Cause he's lovin', touchin', another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry

Turn it on, turn it on again
