Reggae got soul
Got so much soul
Reggae got soul
Got so much soul
(One time man)

Listen to the beat
Move your dancing feet
Rock your body line
Move in time

You don't have to salute
While I'm passing through

Listen to the beat
Move your dancing feet
Rock your body line
Right in time

This reggae got soul
Got so much soul
(Yeah, what time)

Grandmother, can do it?
Grandfather, can do it?
Do it and feel alright

This reggae got soul
Got so much soul
Reggae got soul
For the young and old

Reggae got soul
Got so much soul
Reggae got soul
For the young and old

Reggae got soul
Got so much soul
Reggae got soul
For the young and old

Reggae got soul
Got so much soul
Reggae got soul
For the young and old

Reggae got soul
Got so much soul
Reggae got soul
For the young and old

Reggae got soul
Got so much soul
Reggae got soul
For the young and old

Reggae got soul
Got so much soul...
