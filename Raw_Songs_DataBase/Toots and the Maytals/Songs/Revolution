Listen
In the night we'd take a walk in the park
And there we would sit and talk
In the morning we'll have those thoughts
And in the day we would brake those hearts

Why you treat me in such funny ways?

If you search, you will find
A little peace of mind all the time
If you look over yonder there
You will see that love don't have no fear

Why you treat me in such funny ways?

Listen
Got a feeling deep down inside of me
And I know there is room for everyone to stay
I know there will be a way for me and you
I want to live in unity
Let us live in unity

Do you feel the atmosphere?
Almost everyone is living in fear
If you look over yonder there
You will see that love don't have no fear
Don't you say you are a Christian?
Why don't you pray for the children
And stop the way of revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Lalalalalala... Whoo hoo yeah
Sing it children
