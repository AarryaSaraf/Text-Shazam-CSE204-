Every morning, every night you make me cry
Just because you know I love you
You told me to always wait for you there
Want me to lose my mind?

Then I'll start my crying around
All I do is cry while you just sit and you lie
You told me you really loved me
You loved me, loved me, loved me, loved me true

Want me to lose my mind?
Then I'll start my mind around
Sick and tired of wasting my time
Called you on the phone and you was not at home

That's too bad
You got me way deep down in a soul
That can make you more
Gonna need somebody now
Need somebody true
