I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me son,
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle I hang my head and cry

Well if they'd free me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move just a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

I saw the train' a-coming, it's coming down the track

And I feel the pain deep down, every time someone cries

Babylon has fallen, we're goin' forward and we nah look back

Can you hear the sound of the prison door lock? Feelin' free, feelin' free

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me

Those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me

54-46 that's the number
