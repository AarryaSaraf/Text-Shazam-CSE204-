Baby, here I am
I'm the man and the sea
I can give you what you want
But you gotta go home with me

I've forgotten some good old lovin'
And I get some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You gotta come back for more

Boys and things come down by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now it gets around

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of a great experience
I know you've got you another man
But I can love you better than him

Take my hand, don't be afraid
I'm wanna prove every word I say
I've advertised my love for free
So wanna place your hand with me?

Boys and things come down by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now it gets around

Baby, here I am
I'm the man and the sea
I can give you what you want
But you gotta come home with me

I've forgotten some good old lovin'
And then we get some in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You gotta come back for more

Boys seemly done dime by the dozen
But that ain't nothin' but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now it gets around

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Hard to handle
Hard to handle
Hard to handle
