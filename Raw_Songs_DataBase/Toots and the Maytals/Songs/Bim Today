Bim Today, Bam Tomorrow
I want you tell me the truth girl
Do you feel all right now?
I want you tell me the truth girl
Do you understand me?
Remember I told you that there will be another festival again
What a bim and bam sir
Remember I told you that there will be another happy time again
What a bim and bam sir
I want you tell me, tell me the truth girl
Do you feel all right now?
I want you tell me the truth girl
Do you understand me?
Remember I told you that there will be a nother happy time again
What a bim and bam sir
I want yo tell Ms. Louise Bennett that I say
To tell Mr. Ronnie Williams that I say
That it is coming on a holiday festival again
What a bim and bam sir
I want you tell me the truth girl
This is a bim and bam sir
What a bam and bim sir
What a bim and bam sir
