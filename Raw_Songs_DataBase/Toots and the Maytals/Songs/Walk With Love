Walk in love, talk in love
You will ever walk with love

All my life
Woo, your life
Your life and my life will be much longer
If you really walk in love

I don't mind
I try to live my life
While another man try to take his life

I will never, never, never weary yet
I will never walk alone, no

Live in love
Talk in love, whoa
Walk in love
Walk in love
Walk in love

Walk in love
(Don't down inside my life so strong)
Walk in love
Walk in love
Talk in

Never weary, yea

I'm a man
Try to live my whole life
I saw another man try to take his life

I will never, never, never weary yet
If you walk with love
He will walk in love

Walk in love, walk in love
Walk in love, walk in love

Walk in love, walk in love
Walk in love, walk in love

Walk in love, walk in love
Walk in love, walk in love
