Let me hear you again, now, oh baby, sir

Sweetheart, darling, bear in mind all the time
That a constant friend is hard to find, find
But when you find one that is good and kind, oh

Never you change, never you change
Old for new, oh darling
Never you change, never you change
Old for new

Because I love you, is that I want you to know
That I really, really, really love you so
So, so, so, darling, you remember when we both were small
I never fall in love before, but it's you my heart is aching for

Ooh, ooh, my people
Just keep on, darling, bear in mind all the time
That a constant friend is hard to find, find
But when you find one that is good and kind

Never you change, never you change
Old for new, oh darling, please never you change
Never you change
Old for new, oh darling, never, never
Never you change
Old for new, oh darling
