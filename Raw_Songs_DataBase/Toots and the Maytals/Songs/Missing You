If you didn't love me, you should have let me know
Instead of letting me stay in darkness
If you didn't want me, you should have let me know
Instead of letting me stay in darkness

You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big scandalize

You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big married life

Oh, oh, oh, you make me love you
You make me love you
Tell me why, tell me why?
You let me love you, you make me love you, oh, yeah

Keep on missing you, missing you, missing you
Everywhere I go, missing you, missing you, missing you
I keep on missing, missing, missing you
When I'm going to my bed, I keep on seeing you

If you didn't love me, you should have let me know
That your love was not for real, no way
If you didn't want me, you should have let me know
Instead of scandalizing my name

You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big married life

You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big scandalize

Oh, no, no, you made me love you
You make me love you
Tell me why, tell me why?
You let me love you, you make me l-l-love you, oh, yeah

I keep on, I keep on missing you
Everywhere I go, I keep on missing you
I keep on missing, missing
Early in the morning, late in the night

I said, missing you, missing you, missing you
When I take the plane, even when I'm on the ground
My heart beat goes around, all because of you
I don't know why, I keep on missing you, keep on seeing you

Somebody told me that you say, your love is going away
But somewhere or the other, I will see you there
I keep on missing you, missing you, missing you, ah, oh
I keep on missing you, missing you, missing you, ooh, yeah
I keep on missing you, missing you
