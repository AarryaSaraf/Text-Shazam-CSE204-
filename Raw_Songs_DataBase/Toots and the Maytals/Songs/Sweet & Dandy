Alright!

Eh hey!
Etty in the room a cry
Mama say she must, "wipe her eyes"
Papa say, "she nuh fi foolish like she never been to school at all"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

Eh hey!
Johnson in the room a fret
Uncle say he must, "hold up him head!"
Aunty say, "him nuh fi foolish like a nuh time fi him wedding day"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
Why they were dancing
In that ball room last night

One pound ten for the wedding cake
20 bottle of cola wine
All the people them dress up inna white
Fi go eat out Johnson wedding cake

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

But it was sweet and dandy
Sweet and dandy
