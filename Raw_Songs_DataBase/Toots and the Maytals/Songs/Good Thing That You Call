It's a good time that you call
It's a good thing that you call me
Really it's a good time that you call
When no one else can listen to us

It was a good thing when you call
A good thing when you call me
Really was a good thing when you call
So that we can talk things over now

I've been calling you night and day
Didn't you see my missed calls?
I've been texting you every time
Didn't you check your BP?

It's a good time that you call
It's a good thing that you call me
Really it's a good time that you call
When no one else can listen to us

Sometimes you slip, sometimes you slide
Sometimes you caught up in a frame of mind
And you don't know the reason why
Our love will never die

I'm living in Kingston
I heard you living in Portmore
I heard you living in the Country
Why don't you come over and see me?

It's a good time that you call
It's a good time that you call me
Really it's a good time that you call
When no one else can listen to us
It was a good thing when you call

I've been calling you night and day
Didn't you see my missed calls?
I've been texting you every time
Didn't you check your BP?

It was a good thing when you call
A good thing when you call me
Really was a good thing when you call
So that we can talk things over now

It's a good time that you call
It's a good thing that you call me
Really it's a good time when you call
When no one else can listen to us
