Hey, Celia, Celia
Oh Celia, you Celia

I left my home for four long years
And now I come back home
The woman I left in charge of my house
Has gone with everything

She took my pop, she took my plates
She took my knife and fork
And everything that's necessary
She's gone with everything

She took my bed, she took my spread
She took my pillows too
And everything that's necessary
She's gone with everything

Yeah Celi-Celi-Celia
Celia, Celia
Celia, oh Celia
Celia, oh Celia

I left my home for four long years
And now I come back home
The woman I left in charge of my home
She's gone with everything

She took my shoes, took my socks
Took my pants and shirt
And everything that's necessary
She's gone with everything

Oh Celia, oh Celia
Celia, Celia
Oh Celia, Celia
Celia, Celia
Oh Celia, oh Celia

I left my home for four long years
And now I come back home
The woman I left in charge of my house
She's gone with everything

She took my bed, she took my spread
She took my pillows, too
Ah everything that's necessary
She's gone with everything

Celia, oh Celia
Oh Celia, Celia
Oh Celia, oh Celia
Oh Celia, Celia
