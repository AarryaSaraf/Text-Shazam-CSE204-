Just like that
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Just like that, just like that
You are walking out of my room
Just like that
Just like that, just like that
You are walking out of my room
Just like that
Saw you packing up your things
All your jewelries and rings
So if you have to go
I won't say no
Saw you packing up your things
All your diamonds and rings
But if you have to go
I won't say no
I say, just like that, just like that
You are walking out of my room
Just like that
Want you to know
That I love you so
So if you have to go
I won't say no
I miss you away
But you don't want to stay
So if you have to go
I won't say no
