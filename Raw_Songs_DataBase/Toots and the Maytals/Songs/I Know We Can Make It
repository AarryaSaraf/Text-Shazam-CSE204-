I know we can make it if you don't break up our true love
Things will be better if we stick together all of our life
There is a fountain flowing with milk and honey for you
Life will be better, we can make it together, oh yes, we can

I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

They say you're getting out of your head
You should try and hold up instead, ooh
You say you're getting out of your head
Why you keep on worrying yourself?

Keep worrying yourself, so much
If your love is mine then let me know

You say you're getting out of your head
You should try and hold up instead
You say you're getting out of your head
Why you keep on worrying yourself?

Keep worrying yourself, so much
If your love is mine then let me know

I know we can make it if you don't break up our true love
Things will be better if we stick together all of our life
There is a fountain flowing with milk and honey for you
Life will be better, we can make it together, oh yes, we can

I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
