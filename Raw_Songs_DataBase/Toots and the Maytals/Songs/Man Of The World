Shall I tell you about my life
They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls

I guess I've got everything I need
And I wouldn't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
I'd just love to say I was born, I was born

Yeah I need a good woman
To let me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man
But I'd be if I could

I can tell you about my life
And keep you amused I'm sure
About all the times that I have cried
And how I don't want to be sad anymore

I wish I was in love yeah
Yes I wish I was in love
I wish I was in love
One more time
One more time

We're just moving, moving
We're just moving, moving consciously
Yeah the reggae's moving, moving consciously
