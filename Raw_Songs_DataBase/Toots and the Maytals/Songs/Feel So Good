As I was walking on Orange Street, I feel so lonely
And shook up and shook up and shook up for a little love, yeah
And I walked, and I walked, and I walked and I just couldn't find
Couldn't find, couldn't find that little love, yeah afterwards I feel so good
Afterwards I find my lover, I feel so good afterwards

As I was walking on that street, I feel so lonely
And shook up, and shook up and shook up for a slice of bread, yeah
And Mr. Walker's bakery was the only bakery I could check on
I could check on, I could check on, I could check on for a slice of bread
Then I feel so good afterwards, oh yeah, I feel so good afterwards

As I was walking on Orange Street, I feel so lonely
And shook up, and shook up and shook up for a little love, yeah
And I walked, and I walked, and I walked and I talked, and I talked
'Til I find a little love, oh Lord and I feel so good afterwards, yeah
I feel so good afterwards, Lord

As I was walking on that street afterwards
Yeah, and I feel so good afterwards
Yeah, and I was walking on Orange Street
