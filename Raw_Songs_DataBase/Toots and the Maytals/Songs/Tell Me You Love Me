Tell me, tell me, tell me... what's on your mind?
Tell me, my loved one tell me... what's on your mind?
You leave my home more and more
I never knew that you'd be hurt
Tell me, tell me... I've done you wrong

A lover like you because you understand
Especially you're going like your hairy man
I know no one in this world will do
'Cause, just because I have you my love
