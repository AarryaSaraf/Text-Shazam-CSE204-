If you fall, you can rise
Pick up yourself from off the ground
Sometimes your good friend let you down
Saying bad things about you
Just use it as a motivation
'Cause I know your expectation
Don't you prejudice against no Nation
I know what you anticipating

Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies get you down
Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies win your Crown

What fall off your head, fall on the ground (fall on the ground)
What fall off your head, fall on the ground (fall on the ground)
Sometime it fall on your shoulder (ugh!)
You got to cry a little louder
Don't call Crimson and Clover
Cause as you twitch your eye it will be over

Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies get you down
Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies win your Crown
