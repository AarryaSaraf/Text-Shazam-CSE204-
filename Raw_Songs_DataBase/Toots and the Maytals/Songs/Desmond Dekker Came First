Sing a song yeah
Reggae soul my brother

There is a right or a wrong way
Just to do everything
There's a right or a wrong way
Just to do everything

Desmond Dekker, he came first
And The Techniques, they came third
Clancy Eccles, he runs fourth
And Derrick Harriot, he came fifth
So I came second... mmmmm mmm mmm...
In the competition
