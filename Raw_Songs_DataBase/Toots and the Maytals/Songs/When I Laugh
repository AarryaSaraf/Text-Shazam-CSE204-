When I laugh, I laugh with the world
When I talk, I talk with the world
I want to tell you my people about
When I laugh, I laugh with the world
When I talk, I talk with the world
I want to tell you my people about
I got nothing in need of 
So when I'm laughing, please laugh out with me
When I walk, I walk with the world
When I talk, I talk with the world
I want to tell everybody I got love in my heart
So when I'm loving, please love on with me
When I walk, I walk in this world
When I talk, I talk with the world
I want to tell everybody, I got nothing in need of 
So when I'm laughing, please laugh out with me
