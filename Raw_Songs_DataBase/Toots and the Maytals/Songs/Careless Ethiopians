So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone astray
So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone away
Hey, hey

They calling up an Antichrist
Each night and day
Pray for a God to come from outer space

So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone astray
So much careless Ethiopians
Have lost their way

Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
I said I wonder what you do
You gotta come my way
Come my way

Is they know not where they're going?
They've gone astray
