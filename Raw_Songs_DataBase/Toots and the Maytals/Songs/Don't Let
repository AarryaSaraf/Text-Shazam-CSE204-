Don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you
You, darling, you are the apple of my eye
Baby let me tell you
You're really sweet like cherry pie
Yeah you got me spinning and I don't know what to do
So please don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you because I love you deep down in the bottom of my heart
Did anyone tell you that I've been seeing someone new
Baby let me tell you
Darling please don't don't you believe
If you just come to me our hearts will beat as one

So please don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you because I love you deep down in the bottom of my heart
My darling, when I look into your face darling darling... All I can see
Baby let me tell you
Is pure teardrops falling from your eyes
I want you to understand that I love no one but you
So please don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you because I love you deep down in the bottom of my heart
