In this struggle, poor people can't see their way
In this struggle, we need to cooperate
In this struggle world, we need to love
In this struggle, many try to fight me down

But I'm not gonna fight against them
That fight against I
And I'm not telling no lie
And if I should fight against you
The way you fight against me
There would be no peace

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

You say you love me, and then you hurt me
I can't believe those things you've been doing to me
You cheated me, you even accusing me
You done me wrong, fighting me so long

But I'm not gonna fight against them
That fight against I
And I'm not telling no lie
And if I should fight against you
The way you fight against me
There would be no peace

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

You said you love me, and then you hurt me
You're doing things much more destructively
Instead of been my friend, you become my biggest, most biggest enemy
Who to ever diggeth a pit, liable to fall in it, oh oh

Still I'm not gonna fight against them
That fight against I
And I'm not telling no lie
And if I should fight against you
The way you fight against me
There would be no peace

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it
