Got to, got to, got to, got to
Kneeling, oh kneeling
Oh, kneeling, oh, kneeling under ever loving ways


Kneeling, ooh kneeling
Oh, kneeling, oh, kneeling, kneeling under ever loving ways

Feel I'm going to lose, lose my mind
Like I'm going to cry right now
Feel I'm going to lose, lose my mind
Feel I'm going to cry, cry right now

And he said, "Sister
You better come fall down on your knees and pray for all your sins"
And he said, "Brother
You know you're fitting for thy kingdom"

Just like when Joshua commanded stood still
He didn't, stood still
And I said "Father
Please, please, please have mercy upon me"

'Cause I got to, got to, got to
Kneeling, ooh kneeling
Ooh, oh kneeling, kneeling under ever loving ways
Everybody sing the song
Kneeling, oh, oh kneeling

And God said, let there be light, oh yeah
And God divided the dark from the light
And the light He called day
And the darkness He called night

So the evening and the morning was the first day
God created the heaven, sand and earth
And this earth was without form and void

'Cause I got to, got to, got to
Kneeling, ooh, oh kneeling
Oh, kneeling, oh kneeling, kneeling under ever loving ways
