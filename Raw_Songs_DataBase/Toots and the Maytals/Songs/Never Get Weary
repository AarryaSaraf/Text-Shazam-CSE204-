And I never get weary yet
I was down in the valley for a very long time
And I never get weary yet

I was born and raised in a little old shack
With my poor family
I was born and raised in a little old shack
With my poor family, with my poor family

And I was born before the Ara wok Indians
Trying creation, before this nation
I always remember, I can't forget, wo, wo, wo

I was walking on the shore when they took me in the ship
And they throw me overboard
And I swung right out of the belly of the whale
And I never get weary yet

They put me in jail and I did not do no wrong
And I never get weary yet
Say they put me in jail and I didn't get no bail
And I never get weary yet, never get weary yet

And I was born before the Ara wok Indians
Trying creation, before this nation
I always remember, which I can't forget, oh, yeah

And I never get weary yet
