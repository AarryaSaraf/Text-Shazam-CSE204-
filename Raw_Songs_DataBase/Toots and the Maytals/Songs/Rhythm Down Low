Rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Rhythm down low

I wanna sleep in the night
But the music is too high
Turn off the bright lights
And everything is alright
I wanna get my rights
In the middle of the night

Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Rhythm down low

I want to concentrate
I won't hesitate
I wanna sing my song
Sing it, sing it all night long
Because we really don't play
And we really won't wait

Turn the lights down low
Turn the rhythm down low

Listen...
All my life I've been feeling this rhythm
It makes me feel alright
All night long it's the same thing, repeated
Again and again and again and again and again

Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low, babe

I feel alright
Oh, and everything is alright
Turn the bright lights off
Let me come into my bed
I said the music's so high
Ohh, but the rhythm down low...
