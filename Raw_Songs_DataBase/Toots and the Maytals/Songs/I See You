These words I say to you I hope
Will touch the strings within your heart
Wherever there's a song to play
These words to bring you pleasant dreams
Throughout the night of lonely sleep
I'll keep you warm while I'm away

I see you every hour of the day
I see you all through the night
I see you in the dark
I see you in the light
Your love is really on my mind

Words that remain while you awake
A dawn to greet another day
A day of love that we'll both share
Our hearts to dance like swaying leaves
Of roses in the gentle breeze
These words and dance so pure and clear
Listen

I see you every hour of the day
I see you all through the night
I want to tell you something
I see you in the dark
I see you in the light
Your love is really on my mind

These words I say to you I hope
Will touch the strings within your heart
Wherever there's a song to play
Listen
A song to bring you pleasant dreams
Throughout your night of lonely sleep
I'll keep you warm while I'm away
Listen

I see you every hour of the day
I see you all through the night
Mmm I see you right now
I see you in the dark
I see you in the light
Your love is really on my mind

I see you every hour of the day, ha ha
I see you all through the night
Mmm I see you right now!
I see you in the dark
I see you in the light
Your love is really...
