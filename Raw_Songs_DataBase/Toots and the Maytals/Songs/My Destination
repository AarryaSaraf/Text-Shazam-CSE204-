Well, I feel in love with a girl on Sunday
Fell in love with my friend on Monday
My mind was worried, my heart was in trouble

He's her fascination
Her inspiration
And her destination

I was walking on a lonely road one Tuesday
I met a girl, she dates me on Wednesday

On Thursday, we were walking down the aisle
On Friday, we were feeling so fine

If it's not today, if it's not today...

She's my fascination
My inspiration
And my destination
