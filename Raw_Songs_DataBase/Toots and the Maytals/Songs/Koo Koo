Koo, koo, you have me in the corner, baby
Hey, hey, I don't know what is happening
Koo, Koo, you have me in the corner
But I, know I, don't love her again
No I, know I, don't love her again

It's true, she told me that I love her but
Hey, hey, I can't live without her
Ooh, ooh, they told me that is lovely
But I, know I, don't love her again
No I, know I, don't love her again

Koo, koo, you told me he's your lover
There is no one there but me
Told me that you really want to leave me
Want to leave me, want to leave me, baby

I tell you, koo, koo, you have me in the corner, baby
Hey, hey, I don't know what is going on
Koo, koo, you told me that you love me
But I, know I, don't love her again, it's alright

Free man, I'm better, better, better than you, babe

Koo, koo, she told me that you love me, baby
Hey, hey, you want me to understand
Koo, koo, you give your loving up
But I, know I, don't love her again
'Cause I, 'cause I, don't love her again


'Cause I, 'cause I, don't love her again

But I, know I, don't love her again
But I, know I, don't love her again
But I, know I, don't love her again
But I, know I, don't love her again
