What the world needs today
A little spiritual healing
And everyone's got to say
It's gives a good feeling

Spiritual healing
So good
It gives a higher feeling
Ooh yeah

Spiritual healing
So good, good, good
It's good for your bad feeling
Ooh yeah

Satisfy yourself and be a part of it
(Be a part of it, c'mon and be a part of it)
Reunite your love and be a part of me
Hear what I say

Spiritual healing
So good
It gives a higher feeling
Ooh yeah

Spiritual healing
So good, good, good
It's good for your bad feeling
Ooh yeah

Open your heart so wide
Let love come 'round in here, believe me
If you have that love in your own life
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, yeah

Spiritual healing
So good
It gives a higher feeling
Ooh glory alleluia

Spiritual healing
So good, good, good
It's good for your bad feeling

Living in this world of today, we don't love
It's just a waste of time
And if you have that love in your heart
You gotta give it to 'em with the spiritual feeling
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Spiritual healing
So good
It gives a higher feeling
Ooh, glory alleluia

Spiritual heal, heal, healing
So good, good, good
It's good for your bad feeling

The way we don't inside

So good, good, good
It's good for your bad feeling

Spiritual healing
So good
