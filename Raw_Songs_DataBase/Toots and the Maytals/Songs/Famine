I wake up early one morning
Then I went down to Spanish Town
To look for a friend of mine who called seminaya
Then we started to have a little talk about everything
About the situation
And this is what he said
He told me famine famine famine
Famine on the land
I said the cost of living getting so high high high
Then I trod down to Old Harbour to look for my brother John
To ask him how is life and things and things and things
Then we started to have a little talk about everything
About the situation
And this is what he said
He told me famine famine famine
Famine on the land
I said the cost of living getting so high high high
Really so high high high
So sky high
I said the situation is getting so high high high
Then I trod down to Clarendon to look for my family
Into a little district called Treadlight
That's where I was born
And we started to have a little talk together together
About the situation
And this is what they said
They told me famine famine famine
Famine on the land
I said the cost of living getting so high high high
Really so high high high
So sky high
I said this cost of living getting so high high high
Getting so high
