When you feel like loving
I feel like loving too
When you feel like kissing
I feel like kissing too

When you feel like dancing
I feel like dancing with you
And this must be true
True love

Tell me that you love me
Cause I'm in love with you
Although it's the first time I met you
I feel like kissing with you

Just tell me that you love me
Cause I'm in love with you
And this must be true
True love

Tell me that you love me
Cause I'm in love with you
I've been kind you told me
You will love no one but me

Though it's the first time I met you
I feel like kissing with you
This must be true
True love

Tell me that you love me
Cause I'm in love with you
I've been kind you told me
You will love no one but me

Just when you feel like kissing
I feel like kissing with you
And this must be true
True love
This must be true
True love
