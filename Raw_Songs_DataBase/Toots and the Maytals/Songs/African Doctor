You can stay in the dark, brother
You can stay in the dark
You can stay in the dark, sister
You can stay in the dark

I called for the African doctor
Just to play a part for me
He told me that's an easy thing to do
He told me, we don't need no relation

We don't want no relation
We don't need no relation
We don't want no relation
