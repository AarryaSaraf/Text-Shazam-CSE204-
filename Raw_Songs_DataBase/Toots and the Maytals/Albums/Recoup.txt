// Loving Spirit //

I say, I feel the loving spirit deep down in my soul
Let me ask you about something brother
Can you feel it? Yes, I feel it
Can you feel that spirit now? Yes, I feel it

Though he washed my people's slate
And he make it white as snow
He plant his footsteps on the sea
And he rides upon a star
So consecrate this now

I say, I got the loving spirit deep down in my soul
I say, I feel the loving spirit deep down in my soul
This is such a situation deep down in my soul
Can you feel it? Yes, I feel it
Can you feel the spirit? Yes, I feel it

// Koo Koo //

Koo, koo, you have me in the corner, baby
Hey, hey, I don't know what is happening
Koo, Koo, you have me in the corner
But I, know I, don't love her again
No I, know I, don't love her again

It's true, she told me that I love her but
Hey, hey, I can't live without her
Ooh, ooh, they told me that is lovely
But I, know I, don't love her again
No I, know I, don't love her again

Koo, koo, you told me he's your lover
There is no one there but me
Told me that you really want to leave me
Want to leave me, want to leave me, baby

I tell you, koo, koo, you have me in the corner, baby
Hey, hey, I don't know what is going on
Koo, koo, you told me that you love me
But I, know I, don't love her again, it's alright

Free man, I'm better, better, better than you, babe

Koo, koo, she told me that you love me, baby
Hey, hey, you want me to understand
Koo, koo, you give your loving up
But I, know I, don't love her again
'Cause I, 'cause I, don't love her again

[?]
'Cause I, 'cause I, don't love her again

But I, know I, don't love her again
But I, know I, don't love her again
But I, know I, don't love her again
But I, know I, don't love her again

// Got To Be There //

Lord I must know
If you've been weeping and wailing
Naughty, naughty
Who knows how that love had to linger on
Someone help

Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate

If you go the bad way
You must prepare to get bad pay
The seed you sow, girl
This you shall surely reap, my brother and sister

Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate

Lord have mercy now
(I feel the spirit)
Brother Moses got to be there
Also brother Peter got to be there
The sinners got to be there
I've got to be there too

Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate

If you are from Canada
If you are from America
If you are from Africa
If you are from Jamaica

You got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate

// I See You //

These words I say to you I hope
Will touch the strings within your heart
Wherever there's a song to play
These words to bring you pleasant dreams
Throughout the night of lonely sleep
I'll keep you warm while I'm away

I see you every hour of the day
I see you all through the night
I see you in the dark
I see you in the light
Your love is really on my mind

Words that remain while you awake
A dawn to greet another day
A day of love that we'll both share
Our hearts to dance like swaying leaves
Of roses in the gentle breeze
These words and dance so pure and clear
Listen

I see you every hour of the day
I see you all through the night
I want to tell you something
I see you in the dark
I see you in the light
Your love is really on my mind

These words I say to you I hope
Will touch the strings within your heart
Wherever there's a song to play
Listen
A song to bring you pleasant dreams
Throughout your night of lonely sleep
I'll keep you warm while I'm away
Listen

I see you every hour of the day
I see you all through the night
Mmm I see you right now
I see you in the dark
I see you in the light
Your love is really on my mind

I see you every hour of the day, ha ha
I see you all through the night
Mmm I see you right now!
I see you in the dark
I see you in the light
Your love is really...

// Revolution //

Listen
In the night we'd take a walk in the park
And there we would sit and talk
In the morning we'll have those thoughts
And in the day we would brake those hearts

Why you treat me in such funny ways?

If you search, you will find
A little peace of mind all the time
If you look over yonder there
You will see that love don't have no fear

Why you treat me in such funny ways?

Listen
Got a feeling deep down inside of me
And I know there is room for everyone to stay
I know there will be a way for me and you
I want to live in unity
Let us live in unity

Do you feel the atmosphere?
Almost everyone is living in fear
If you look over yonder there
You will see that love don't have no fear
Don't you say you are a Christian?
Why don't you pray for the children
And stop the way of revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Lalalalalala... Whoo hoo yeah
Sing it children

// 54-46 Was My Number //

Stick it up, mister!
Can you hear what I'm saying now, yeah
Get your hands in the air, sir!
And you will get no hurt, mister, no no no

I said yeah (I said yeah)
Listen what they say (listen what they say)
Can you hear me say, yeah? (yeah yeah)
Listen what they say (listen what they say)

Do you believe I would take such a thing with me
And give it to a police man?
I wouldn't do that, oh no (ooh, ooh)
I wouldn't do that (ooh, ooh)

And if I do that, I would say "Sir
Come on and put the charge on me"
I wouldn't do that (ooh, ooh)
I wouldn't do that (ooh, ooh)

I'm not a fool to hurt myself
So I was innocent of what they done to me
They were wrong (ooh, ooh), oh yeah
They were wrong (ooh, ooh)

You give it to me one time (huh)
You give it to me two times (huh-huh)
You give it to me three times (huh-huh-huh)
You give it to me four times (huh-huh-huh-huh)

54-46 was my number, was my number, man
Right now, someone else has that number
54-46 was my number, well
Right now, someone else has that number

And I said yeah (I said yeah)
Listen what they say (listen what they say)
Can you hear me say, yeah? (yeah yeah)
Listen what they say (listen what they say)
Oh, work could not control me now
Oh, no bars could not hold me now
They hold I down and they lock-a you way
They try to keep I for a year and a day
But through the powers of the Most High God
Got to turn me lose, I say

54-46 was my number, was my number, man
Right now, someone else has that number, well
54-46 was my number, was my number, man
Right now, someone else has that number, hey

// Back To The Island //

Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island

Now the day is gone and I sit alone, thinking of you, girl
What can I do without you in my life?
I guess that our guessing game just had to end that way
The hardest one to lose of all the games we played

Now the time has passed of living in a dream world
Lying to myself, can't make that scene
Of wondering if you love me or just making a fool of me
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to my island

And watch the sun go down
(Sit and watch the sun go down)
Hear the sea roll in
(Listen to the sea roll in)

And I'll be thinking of you
(Yes, and I'll be thinking of you)
And how it might have been
(Thinking how it might have been)

Hear the night birds cry
(Listen to the night birds cry)
See the sunset die
(Sit and watch the sunset die)
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island

Of all the fun we had, it's still raining in my heart
I know down in my soul I'm surely gonna miss you
But it had to end that way of all the games we played
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island

And watch the sun go down
(Sit and watch the sun go down)
Hear the sea roll in
(Listen to the sea roll in)

And I'll be thinking of you
(Yes, and I'll be thinking of you)
And how it might have been
(Thinking how it might have been)

Hear the night birds cry
(Listen to the night birds cry)
See the sunset die
(Sit and watch the sunset die)
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island
I got to go back, I got to go back, I got to go back, see the sunset die

// Love Gonna Walk Out On Me //

Every time I see your face
Something moves within my heart
And it thrills me to my soul
And tell me that love is gonna let me down
I can't believe that baby
Love is gonna let me down
I see the morning sun
I know everything is alright
I could see you rushing to my door
And tell me that love is gonna let me down
I can't believe what you're saying to me baby
Love is gonna let me down
I can see the morning sun
And knowing that everything, everything is alright
I can see you rushing through that door
And tell me that love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna walk out on me
