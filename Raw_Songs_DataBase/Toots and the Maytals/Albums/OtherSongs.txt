// Folsom Prison Blues //

I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me son,
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle I hang my head and cry

Well if they'd free me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move just a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

I saw the train' a-coming, it's coming down the track

And I feel the pain deep down, every time someone cries

Babylon has fallen, we're goin' forward and we nah look back

Can you hear the sound of the prison door lock? Feelin' free, feelin' free

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me

Those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me

54-46 that's the number

// Gee Whiz //

Oh no, I never believe you
Oh no, I didn't receive you
Oh no, I never believe you
I never believe what you say

I say gee, gee whiz, look what you told me
Gee whiz, look how you tell me, tell me, tell me
Gee whiz, look how you tell me
Look how you tell me I lie

That's why I say oh yeah, look what you do me
Oh yeah, look what you do me, do me, do me
Oh yeah, look what you do me
Look what you've done to me

I say break up, break up, break up
Break up, you're falling down
Break up, break up, break up
Break up, you're falling down
Break up, break up, break up, you're falling down
Break up, break up, you're falling down

Oh no, I never believe you
Oh no, I didn't receive you
Oh no, I never believe you
I never believe what you say

That's why I say gee whiz, look what you tell me
Gee whiz, look what you tell me
Gee whiz, look what you tell me
Look what you tell me a lie

That's why I say oh yeah, look what you do me
Oh yeah, look what you do me, do me, do me
Oh yeah, look what you do me
Look what you've done to me

I say break up, break up, break up
Break up, you're falling down
Break up, break up, break up
Break up, you're falling down
Break up, break up, break up, you're falling down
Break up, break up, you're falling down

Oh no, I never believe you
Oh no, I didn't receive you
Oh no, I never believe you
I never believe what you say

Gee whiz, look what you tell me
Gee whiz, look what you tell me
Gee whiz, look what you tell me

// Gonna Need Somebody //

Every morning, every night you make me cry
Just because you know I love you
You told me to always wait for you there
Want me to lose my mind?

Then I'll start my crying around
All I do is cry while you just sit and you lie
You told me you really loved me
You loved me, loved me, loved me, loved me true

Want me to lose my mind?
Then I'll start my mind around
Sick and tired of wasting my time
Called you on the phone and you was not at home

That's too bad
You got me way deep down in a soul
That can make you more
Gonna need somebody now
Need somebody true

// Hard To Handle //

Baby, here I am
I'm the man and the sea
I can give you what you want
But you gotta go home with me

I've forgotten some good old lovin'
And I get some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You gotta come back for more

Boys and things come down by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now it gets around

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of a great experience
I know you've got you another man
But I can love you better than him

Take my hand, don't be afraid
I'm wanna prove every word I say
I've advertised my love for free
So wanna place your hand with me?

Boys and things come down by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now it gets around

Baby, here I am
I'm the man and the sea
I can give you what you want
But you gotta come home with me

I've forgotten some good old lovin'
And then we get some in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You gotta come back for more

Boys seemly done dime by the dozen
But that ain't nothin' but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now it gets around

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Hard to handle
Hard to handle
Hard to handle

When I look
When I look
When I look
Oh yes indeed
When I look
I could see the earth before me
I could see them wave their hands to me
All I got to do is shake my head and cry
'Cause when I look and see no one's been cheering me
When I start forgetting about the world and my life
Somebody said it's the wrong thing to do
So I stop forgetting about the world and my life
Then I heard a voice from heaven saying "Toots, don't fret no more"
So I stopped, looked, and listened
Oh then I hear the good kind say
Son you can go your way
Yes you just buck up and free again
Yes I'm free again
I'm glad to see you free again
Good lord I'm free again
