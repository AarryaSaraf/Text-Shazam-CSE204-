Could've broken me like glass in an emergency
It's a giving in, where do I begin?
Pastel skies, I don't know why
I hate Florida sometimes
Is it take and take?
Or is it my mistake?

What I used to know, I don't know
Keeps spinning me out, I lose control
When it feels like I am on my own
Don't try to save me

One thing I am sure of is everything will change
Time moves fast, you grow old
Days we can't rearrange
Changing tides, I feel it in my bones
And I don't ask why and I just let them go 'cause I know
One thing I am sure of
For you, I'll wait

In the sand you dig your heels, on who I am and what is real
Only you and me, and all we're going to be

What I used to know, I don't know
Keeps spinning me out, I lose control
When it feels like I am on my own
Don't try to save me

One thing I am sure of is everything will change
Time moves fast, you grow old
Days we can't rearrange
Changing tides, I feel it in my bones
And I don't ask why and I just let them go 'cause I know
One thing I am sure of
For you, I'll wait
