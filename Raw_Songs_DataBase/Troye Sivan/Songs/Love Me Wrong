Oh, you love me
You put me to bed
Yeah, you love me
Dress me to the nines
Yeah, you love me
You tell me I'm special, so special
I know you love me
'Cause you want the best

But you love me wrong
Yeah you love me wrong

Oh, you love me
You lose sleep over me
I know you love me
'Cause I'm there in your wallet
And your locket
I heard you talk about me in the kitchen
And you didn't know I was listening
But I was there
Sitting on the stairs
Talk about me in the kitchen
And you didn't know I was listening
But I was there
And that isn't fair

Wrong
Yeah you love me wrong
Yeah you love me wrong
Yeah you love me wrong
Yeah you love me wrong
Yeah you love me wrong
You love me wrong

I'll never be
How you remember me
So I'd rather be
In your memory
No, I'll never be
How you remember me
So I'd rather be
In your memory
