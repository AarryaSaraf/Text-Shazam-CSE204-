I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time
Then it's time to go
Take yourself home

Talk to me
There's nothing that can't be fixed with some honesty
And how it got this dark is just beyond to me
If anyone can hear me switch the lights (Lights, lights, lights)
Oh-oh-oh-oh

And happiness
Is right there where you lost it
When you took the bet
Counting all the losses that you can't collect
Got everything and nothing in my life

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

Who you really tryna be when they see your face?
Is it worth it trying to win in a losing game?
Well it's all waiting for you
And, boy, I know you're eager
But it just might destroy you
Destroy you, yeah

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home
Take yourself home
