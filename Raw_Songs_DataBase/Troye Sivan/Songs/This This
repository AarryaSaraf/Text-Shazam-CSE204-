Babe, you know I regret those words
Bombs that you did not deserve
Well alright, alright
And hey, usually just takes a day
Before we're on a brand new page
Alright, well that's fine

We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
Taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's alright

So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (how do we?)
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (how do we?)
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this

Ties can tangle up and become knots
Gotta work so that we don't get caught
Alright, alright
And I will take myself to the front line
Don't care if it's talking all night
It's alright, it's alright

We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
Taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's all alright
