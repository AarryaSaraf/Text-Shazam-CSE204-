I'll keep wearing these running shoes 'til I'm all worn out
And they're no use to me
No use to me
Gunning for a peace from this abuse
'Cause I'm all tired out and I'm no use to you
No use to you

And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while

These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running

Carved his name in the carpet
Right where I spent all of my sleepless nights in that room
In that room
Can't get his face out of my mind
And God knows that I've tried and tried for you

And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)
I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)

These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
(Running, running)
(Running, running)
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
(Running, running)
(Running, running)

Love in America got me down
Try to take off running but hit the ground

These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
