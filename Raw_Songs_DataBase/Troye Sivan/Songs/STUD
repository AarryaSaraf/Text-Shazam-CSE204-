Hey, stud, you can come
And you can come and meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love

Hey, tough, what's it like to be so big and strong and so buff?
Everything I'm not, but could I still be a hunk to you?
Enough for you
A stud to you

Takin' the fun out of fucks
Searchin' for something I'm not
Knowin' that you're not the one
(But you're the one for right now, yeah)

How much of me would you take?
And how much of me would you change?
On second thought, don't say a thing
('Cause you're the one for right now)

Just let me believe that you like what you seein'
When you're lookin' at me and your heartbeat is speedin'
At seven hundred miles down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eatin'

Hey, stud, you can come
And you can come and meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love

Hey, stud, you can come
And you can come and meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love

We're into this (Right?)
We should do this (Right?)
You could make my (Night)
We should do this (Right?)
We're into this (Right?)
We should do this (Right?)
You could make my (Night)
We should do this (Right?)
(Right?)

Just let me believe that you like what you seein'
When you're lookin' at me and your heartbeat is speedin'
At seven hundred miles down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eatin', yeah

You're into this
We should do this

You're into this (Right?)
(You could make my night)
(You're into this, right?)
(You could make my night)
You're into this
(My night)
