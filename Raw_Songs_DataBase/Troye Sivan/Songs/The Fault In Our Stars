The weight
Of a simple human emotion
Weighs me down
More than the tank ever did

The pain
It's determined and demanding
To ache, but I'm OK

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

You lost
A part of your existence
In the war against yourself

Oh, the lights,
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you, it's time to go

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you


Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute,
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute,
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute,
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand


And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

With you
