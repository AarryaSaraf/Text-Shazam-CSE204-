Accidental lover, what you do with all my common sense?
You came in undercover when I didn't even want a friend

I'm tired of living like I'm dying
But now I can find the silver lining like before
Yeah, like before
You got a funny sense of timing
Showed up on the night that I stopped trying for something more
For something more

And I'm like, "Oh sweet God, I think I'm in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And I'm like, "Baby, you're kinda driving me crazy"
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

Tandem lover, what I tell you is in confidence
Laying here together makes me wanna take a second chance

My room is spinning when I'm sober
So somebody wake me in October
Oh my God
You got a funny sense of knowing
I don't know where all this is going
But don't stop

And I'm like, "Oh sweet God, I think I'm in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And I'm like, "Baby, you're kinda driving me crazy"
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

You've got me going under
Can't help but wonder if you'd be there by my side
Or should I just move along all by myself?

You've got me going under
Can't help but wonder if you'd be there by my side
Or should I, I, I

But I'm like, "Oh shit, God, I think we're in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And oh baby, you're kinda driving me crazy
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my
