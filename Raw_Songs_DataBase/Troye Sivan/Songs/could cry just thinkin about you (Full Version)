We wrote a life all by ourselves
Wish I could put it back on the shelf
But there's a dazzling wave that keeps me at bay with you, my love
I ride this one all by myself

I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out
Yeah, I guess I'm 'bout to find out

We took a trip and made the best
We laughed and played, then laid to rest
But life's a blackening way of drifting us further than we are, oh yeah
And now we're knee-deep in this mess

I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out
