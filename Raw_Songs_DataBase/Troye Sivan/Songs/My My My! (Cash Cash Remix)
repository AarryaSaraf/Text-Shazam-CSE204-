Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my

Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my

Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my)
I die every night with you
(I die, I die, I die, I die, yeah, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my)
Living for your every move
(Living for, living for, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
