Album: Bloom

// Seventeen //

I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen

You should know I'm green but I'll find my way around
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about
I'm taking in the sights and measuring the sounds
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen...

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen...

// MY MY MY! //

Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my

Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we're apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure

Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my)
I die every night with you
(I die, I die, I die, I die, yeah, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my)
Living for your every move
(Living for, living for, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
(Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, oh)
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
(Living for your every move)
Oh my, my, my

// The Good Side //

I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
The change in the wind took you down to your knees
I got the good side of you
Send it out into the blue
The people danced to the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart

But I sympathize
And I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

I got the good side of life
Travelled the universe twice
So many thoughts I wanted to share
But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
Then I got the good side of new
Found arms to fall right into
I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
And some day I hope that you'll understand

That I sympathize
And I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
And catch up on everything
I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

But I sympathize
And I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
Sympathize
Recognize
Apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

// Bloom //

Take a trip into my garden
I've got so much to show ya
The fountains and the waters
Are begging just to know ya

And it's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby

I guess it's something like a fun fair
Put gas into the motor
And boy I'll meet you right there
We'll ride the rollercoaster

'Cause it's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby

I need you to
Tell me right before it goes down
Promise me you'll
Hold my hand if I get scared now
Might tell you to
Take a second, baby, slow it down
You should know I, you should know I

(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you

(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you

Now it's the perfect season
Yeah, let's go for it this time
We're dancing with the trees and
I've waited my whole life

'Cause it's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby

I need you to
Tell me right before it goes down
Promise me you'll
Hold my hand if I get scared now
Might tell you to
Take a second, baby, slow it down
You should know I, you should know I

(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you

// Postcard //

I sent you a postcard from Tokyo baby
You never picked it up
I even wrote it in Japanese, baby
You didn't give a fuck

'Cause I don't sleep like your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between, yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need, yeah

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

I remember that night when you first called me crazy
Only you picked it up
Kissed me and said "I love you, baby"
You didn't give a fuck

Now I don't sleep unless your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between, yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need, yeah

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

Take your time
Pull me in, push me out
Simplify all the whispers you doubt
'Cause I know what you're thinking about

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

// Dance To This //

[Troye Sivan:]
Young ambition
Say we'll go slow but we never do
Premonition
See me spendin' every night with you

Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
And I wanna end up on you
Oh, don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do

We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah

Dance to this
Dance to this
We can just dance to this

Dear beloved
Bring those 501s a bit closer, bit closer
And dear, my lover
Do that thing we never do sober, sober

// Plum //

Watching you sleep
Run my hands through your hair and it's got me thinking
What you mean to me
There's a chill in the air and a sinking feeling
Coming over me
Like bitter tangerine
Like sirens in the streets
Oh no

Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding on
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

Jealous you can sleep
You've been keeping me up and I mouth the words
I think I wanna speak
Instead I'm wasting my time just pressing rewind
To all the nights we shared
The ripest peach or pear
But change is in the air, oh

Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding on
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

I was summer, you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring
Yeah, I was summer and you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring

Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding on
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
...

// What A Heavenly Way To Die //

Tell each other you're the one
While we're laying by the poolside, poolside
Getting tired from the sun
Fading in and out of long nights, long nights
There's no limit to your love
East or west we got the north lights, north lights, oh-oh
Take in it a-all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

When our prime has come and gone
And our youth is all but melted, melted
We can listen to this song
So we don't have to accept it, accept it
Just as long as you'll be home
In the one we've manifested-fested
Oh-oh, just take in it a-all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

Just take in it all-all-all-all
Just take in it all-all-all-all
Just take in it all-all-all-all
Just take in it all-all-all-all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

// Lucky Strike //

Oh, I want to know just how to love you
The jewel of California
Oh, I want to skip stones on your skin, boy
And drown me in your water

And my boy like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
A hit of dopamine, higher than I've ever been
He knows how to love me better

Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you

Oh, I wanna tip toe through your bliss, boy
Get lost the more I find ya
Oh (na na na na), don't wanna miss a second of this, boy
Hold tight and love me longer

And my boy like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
A hit of dopamine, higher than I've ever been
He knows how to love me better

Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
(Tell me all the ways to love you)

Breathe me in, exhale slow
Take me to anywhere you wanna go
Breathe me in, exhale slow
Take me to anywhere you wanna go

'Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
(Tell me all the ways to love you)

// Animal //

I told you something safe
Something I've never said before
And I, I, I, can't keep my hands off you
While you lie in the wake
Covered all in the night before
I'm high, high, high, no one's got me quite like you

I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

An ode to the boy I love
Boy I'll die to care for you
You're mine, mine, mine, tell me who do I owe that to
And as the days fly by
We'll be more than getting through, yeah
And in time, time, time, we'll build a home for two

I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
It's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

All is right in the meadow
When I'm lying next to my fellow
Baby that's you
Baby that's you
One way trip like an arrow
All laid out like a tarot
Baby that's you
Baby that's you

I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you
...

// This This //

Babe, you know I regret those words
Bombs that you did not deserve
Well alright, alright
And hey, usually just takes a day
Before we're on a brand new page
Alright, well that's fine

We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
Taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's alright

So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (how do we?)
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (how do we?)
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this

Ties can tangle up and become knots
Gotta work so that we don't get caught
Alright, alright
And I will take myself to the front line
Don't care if it's talking all night
It's alright, it's alright

We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
Taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's all alright

So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (how do we?)
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (how do we?)
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this

Something wrong 'bout to keep in on top
Nothing wrong cause we know when to stop
Something wrong 'bout to keep in on top
Nothing wrong cause we know when to stop

So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we? (yeah, yeah)
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (how do we?)
(No, I don't wanna, I don't wanna let go)
So how do we keep this this?

// Running Shoes //

I'll keep wearing these running shoes 'til I'm all worn out
And they're no use to me
No use to me
Gunning for a peace from this abuse
'Cause I'm all tired out and I'm no use to you
No use to you

And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while

These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running

Carved his name in the carpet
Right where I spent all of my sleepless nights in that room
In that room
Can't get his face out of my mind
And God knows that I've tried and tried for you

And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)
I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)

These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
(Running, running)
(Running, running)
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
(Running, running)
(Running, running)

Love in America got me down
Try to take off running but hit the ground

These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down

// Seventeen (Reprise) //

I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

Here he comes
Like he just walked out of a dream
Doesn't care you're seventeen
Or maybe he forgot what that means
But yeah, he comes
He comes
