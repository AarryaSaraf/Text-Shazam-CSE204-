(Old fashioned love, old fashioned love)

Strollin' down the lane at midnight
Old fashioned love, yeah
Steal a little kiss in the moonlight
Old fashioned love, yeah
You're the love of my life
The girl of my dreams
I can count on you, you can count on me

We got an old
Old fashioned love, oh, baby
It's so hard to find
This one of a kind
Old fashioned love, baby

Gotta be true to each other
In an old fashioned love
Like ours, baby
Never hurt one another, no
In an old fashioned love, ow!
Just like in the movies
But we're not pretending
Always and forever
Our love's one happy ending
(Our love is never-ending)

We got an old
Old fashioned love
You and me, baby, yeah
It's so hard to find
This one of a kind
Old fashioned love
Ooh, baby, yeah

Old fashioned love

You're the love of my life
The girl of my dreams
I can count on you, you can count on me

We got an old
Old fashioned love, yes, baby
It's so hard to find
This one of a kind
Old fashioned love, yeah

That's the kind of love
When a woman loves a man and a man loves a woman
Time keeps passin' and love keeps comin'
All the time, all the time
Strollin' down the lane at midnight
Steal a little kiss in the moonlight

Old, old fashioned love
You and me, baby
Old, old fashioned love, yeah
Gotta be true to each other...
