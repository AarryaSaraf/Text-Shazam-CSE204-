I got nowhere to go
Except closer to you, baby
You're like no one I know
I could spend days on in

Sleepin' in
I can feel the love, babe
Creepin' in
Like a butter on a biscuit
Seepin' in
Hot and sweet
What a tasty treat you are

I love holding you near
Feels so good to me, baby
If we never leave here
That's too soon for me
'Cause we could be

Sleepin' in
I can feel the love, babe
Creepin' in
Like a butter on a biscuit
Seepin' in
Hot and sweet
What a tasty treat you are

Sleepin' in
I can feel the love, babe
Creepin' in
The smell of your perfume
'Cause seepin' in
Drivin' me mad
You're the best I ever had now
You're the best I ever had now
You're the best I ever had now
You're the best I ever had now

Lay with me, babe
Lay with me stay with me
Stay with me lay with me

I love when I wake
To you touching me
Sweet and gentle
I've got so much at stake
You got my fantasies
You got my physical
You got my mental
Yes, you got my physical
You got my mental

Sleepin' in
I can feel the love, babe
Creepin' in
Like a butter on a biscuit
Seepin' in
Hot and sweet
What a tasty treat, ah...

Sleepin' in
I can feel your love, baby
Creepin' in
I can feel your love, babe
(All over me)
Sleepin' in
I can feel your love, babe
(I can feel your love, babe)
Stay with me lay with me
Lay with me stay with me
I can feel your love' babe

Lay with me stay with me
Stay with me lay with me
Sleep, sleep, sleepin' in
