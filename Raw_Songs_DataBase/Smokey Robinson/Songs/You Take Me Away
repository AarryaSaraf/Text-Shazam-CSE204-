Wild love, wild love
Where're we going tonight
What's our fantasy flight gonna be
Fly me right past the moon
Through the galaxy soar
Being with you somewhere
Is all that I'm living for

You take me away
You take me away
You take me away
You take me away

Sweet love, sweet love
What's our destination
Soon to be location gonna be
Some sweet moment in time
Will stand still and we'll be
Lost in each other's arms
Please don't stop loving me

You take me away
You take me away
You take me away
You take me away, baby

Stationary journey
We leave and yet never go
Just one touch and I'm gone
Don't you know, don't you know

You take me away
You take me away, baby
You take me away
You take me away, baby

Take me, take me away
You take me, take me away, baby
Take me away, baby
Take me away
Take me, oh, take me
Ooh, baby, take me
You take me away...
