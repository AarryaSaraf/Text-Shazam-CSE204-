I've been letting you love my hopes up high
You've been letting me down and I've had enough
I won't keep letting you tell me lover's lies
It's for sure, I'm nevermore
Falling for your stuff

Unless you do it again, uh-huh
Unless you do it again, uh-huh
I swear, I won't give in
I won't give in, I won't give in
Unless you do it again, baby

I can't seem to keep away like I should
You can't seem to keep your feelings straight
I won't keep letting love make me feel so good
To let you use me like you choose
I just refuse to tolerate

Unless you do it again, ooh-wee, baby
Unless you do it again, oh-oh...
I swear, I won't give in
I won't give in, I won't give in
Unless you do it again
And again and again and again and again

Unless you do it again, oh, yeah
Unless you do it again, ooh, baby
I swear, I won't give in, I won't give in
Unless you do it again, baby

Every time I take you back
You walk away and I tell myself
I knew it, yeah
Yet every time you come around
And say you're gonna love me
I say, do it, do it
I do it, do it, do it, baby
Do it baby, do it, baby
Do it baby, do it, baby
Do it

Well, I won't be your revolver door
You can't love and leave me anymore

Unless you do it again, ooh-wee, baby
Unless you do it again, do it
Unless you do it again
You can't love me then break free
Unless you do it again, no, baby

Unless you do it again
You're not being straight, I won't tolerate
Unless you do it again, oh...
I swear, I won't give in
I won't give in, I won't give in
Unless you do it again
