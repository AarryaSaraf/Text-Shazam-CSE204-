Turn the lights down low
Baby, come close
Put your hand in mine
Oh, please be kind
Let me touch your heart
Let the fire start
Ooh, so warm, so warm

Yeah, let the soft music play
Please, darling, stay
Put your trust in me
Let this love be
This is for real
Let time stand still
Ooh, so warm, so warm
So warm, yeah

Turn the lights down low
Baby, come close

Ooh, so warm, so warm
So warm, so warm, so warm

Ooh, turn the lights down low
Baby, come close
Let dreams come true
For me and you
Oh, we won't regret, baby
We won't forget
Ooh, so warm, so warm, yeah, yeah

So warm, so warm, yeah
So warm
Turn the lights down low
Baby, come close

Ooh, so warm, so warm
So warm
So warm, so warm
So warm
