I just can't get used to losin' you
All of the dreams we had, turned out so bad
Couldn't read the writing on the wall
I got caught off guard and it hit me so hard

There's not a smile left in my world
Since I lost you, girl

Sad, who's sad, ooh, baby, not me
Just because you my love behind
Sad, who's sad, not me
Just a couple more years and I'll be fine, fine

I wake up, my bad dream just gets worse
Walkin' the same old street where we used to meet
Nothin' seems to matter anymore (nothing)
When something deep inside has withered and died

There's not a smile left in my world
Since I lost you, girl

Sad, who's sad, ooh, baby, not me
Just because you my love behind
Sad, sad, who's sad, ooh, not me
Just a couple more years and I'll be fine, fine

There's no runnin' away
No way to forget
Forget that I'm empty inside
My life has no love
No love without you
Without you here in my life

('Cause there's not a smile left in my world
Ever since I lost you, girl)

Sad, who's sad, ooh, baby, not me
Just because you my love behind
Sad, sad, who's sad, not me
Just a couple more years and I'll be fine

Sad, what makes you think I'm sad
Ooh, not me
Just because you my love behind
Sad, sad, sad, sad, oh, baby, not me...
