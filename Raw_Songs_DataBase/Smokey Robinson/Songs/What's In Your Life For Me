I could give someone like you
My everything, great and small
Bring out the best of me and take it all
Makin' love's a special thing
So take your time and get to know me
True love is what's in my life for you
Now I'm askin' you to show me

What's in your life
What's in your life for me?
Is there anything you can see?
Tell me, baby
Tell me what do you feel for me?

Will tomorrow bring me sorrow
'Cause I confessed my love today?
I'll take a chance on you
Come what may, come what may
Build me up and bring me down
There's no daily guarantee
I'll take the tears to know the joy
Of a chance to really see, ooh...

What's in your life
What's in your life for me?
Is there anything you can see?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, baby
What's in your life for me?

And in my love starvin' mind
It's only you I hunger for
So come fill me up, feed my soul
And if I receive the love I need
Then on your behalf, I'll be whole

Ooh, baby
Is there anything you can see?
Tell me, baby
Tell me what do you need for me?

What's in your life
What's in your life for me?
Is there anything you can see?
Tell me, baby
Tell me what do you feel for me
For me, for me, for me...
