A quarter after midnight, it's cool and sweet
A little bit of moonlight lying at my feet
We're slow dancing 'cross the living room floor
To a song I've heard a thousand times before
Must be the needle in the groove
Not my heartbeat that skipped
'Cause I'm no stranger to the touch of a woman's lips

Oh, it's just another kiss
Just another kiss, that's all it is
I tell myself I can take or leave it
I can't quit
It's just another kiss
Just another kiss
I swear it's something I won't miss
But my heart just won't buy it
Oh, no, no, no, no, oh...
(Just another kiss)

I don't wanna linger on the fact
Ooh, but I can feel your fingers
Traveling down my back
And it's the right time for my usual line
But it all falls apart
When you turn your face to mine
Must be the touch of the night making my head spin
'Cause when I go anywhere, I haven't already been

Oh, it's just another kiss
Just another kiss, that's all it is
I tell myself I can take or leave it
I can't quit
It's just another kiss
Just another kiss
I swear it's something I won't miss
But my heart just won't buy it
Oh, no

Now I can't remember my next move
Could it be you get to me
Uh, well, it's something we can only prove
With just another kiss
Just another kiss

Oh, it's just another kiss
Just another kiss, that's all it is
I tell myself I can take or leave it
I can't quit
It's just another kiss, yeah
Just another kiss
I swear it's something I won't miss
But my heart just won't buy it
Oh, no

(Just another kiss, just another kiss)
I tell myself I can take or leave it
I can't quit
It's just another kiss
Just another kiss
It's something I won't miss
But my heart just won't buy it, oh...
Oh, no...

Just another kiss
Ooh, I keep telling myself, yeah...
