It's no time to stop believing
It's no time to be unsure
Don't go change your mind about us
There's no need to feel insecure

Don't go thinking it's all over
'Cause you know that it's not true
It's no time to stop believing
I'm still in love with you
(Don't stop believing)
I'm still in love with you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't stop believing)

It's a phase we're going through
It will pass and you will see
We'll look back and laugh
I've got faith on you
(Don't stop believing)
So have some faith in me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't stop believing)

It's no time to stop believing
It's no time to be unsure
Don't go change your mind about us
There's no need to feel insecure

It's so hard to get somewhere
And I try too hard, I know
But I'm doing it for us
And if you're not with me, girl
(Don't stop believing)
I don't wanna go
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't stop believing)
I don't wanna go

It's no time to stop believing
There's no need for any doubt
Don't you even think of leaving
I don't want the flame to go out
(Don't stop, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't stop)

It's a phase we're going through
It will pass and you will see
We'll look back and laugh
I've got faith on you
(Don't stop believing)
So have some faith in me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't stop believing)

It's no time to stop believing, don't stop
Don't be unsure
Don't you change your mind about us
There's no need to feel insecure
