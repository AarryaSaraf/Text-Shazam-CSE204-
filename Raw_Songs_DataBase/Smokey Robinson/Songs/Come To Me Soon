Come to me soon as you can, my love
Come to me now
Come to me soon as you can, my love
Come to me now

I am on fire and for what I require
Only you can fulfill my request
I have felt good and I have felt better
But you make me feel the best

Come to me soon
'Cause you know you're the one
Who can light up my life
Yes, you're the midnight moon
And the morning sun
And you light up my life

You got a soothing moving tender touch
Come and be with me
Because I need you so much

I've come to find for my peace of mind
Your presence is mandatory
You've got a few little things that you do
That nobody else can do for me

Come to me soon
And we'll both have it made
Our love will be stronger
Yes, you'll break my balloon
And rain on my parade
If you're gone much longer

You got a soothing moving tender touch
Come and be with me
Because I need you so much

Come to me soon
Baby, baby, come to me now
Come to me soon, yes
Come to me now

Well, you got a soothing moving
Tender touch
Come and be with me
Because I need you so much, oh

Come to me soon
Yes, baby, yes, come to me now
Come to me soon as you can, my love
Come to me now...
