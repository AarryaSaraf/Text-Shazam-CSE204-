Ooh... baby...

All around, all I see
Is people giving up on love
Much too easily
Closing door before they've seen
Everything that might have been
Always searching, reaching
Chasing empty dreams
But, baby, that's not you and me
What we have is all we need

It's the same old love
But it's new every minute
And all I know
Is I'm glad that I'm in it
'Cause the same old love's
Gonna keep us together
For the longest time
For as long as forever

Yeah, hand in hand, side by side
Trust has been our guardian
Respect has been our guide
No regrets, so satisfied
We have no secrets left to hide
And I see the future
Shining in your eyes
That's the light that leads the way
Every hour, every day

It's the same old love
But it's new every minute
And all I know
Is I'm glad that I'm in it
'Cause the same old love's
Gonna keep us together
For the longest time
For as long as forever
(Long as forever)
For as long as forever

(Same old love, every minute)
(Same old love, keep us together)
(Long as forever)

(It's the same old love that feels so new)
But it's new every minute
And all I know
Is I'm glad that I'm in it
'Cause the same old love's
Gonna keep us together
For the longest time
For as long as forever

(It's the same old love that feels so new)
Same old love, same old love
Same old love
But it's fresh, it's new
It's new, it's new
Same old love
Gonna keep us together
For the longest time
For as long as forever

Same old love
But it's new every minute
And all I know
Is I'm glad that I'm in it

Glad that I'm in it, glad that I'm in it
Glad that I'm in it, glad that I'm in it
Glad that I'm in it, glad
Same old love, same old love, love...
