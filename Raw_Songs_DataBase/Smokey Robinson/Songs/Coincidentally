Fancy meetin' you here
Right at the place I said I'd never be
Fancy runnin' into you
Don't you think it's strange runnin' into me?

I said I would never come
'Cause to come here would only make me dumb
Yeah, I cursed and I swore not to come anymore
And play the fool like I did before
Dance above that empty room
Right outside your apartment door

And you're the last person that I expected
I might see right here
I guess it happened to be right here, yeah
Coincidentally

Fancy talkin' to you now
On the other end of the telephone line
Fancy hearin' your voice
Don't you think it's strange that you hearin' mine?

Well, I said I would never call
I'll just forget to love and have a ball
And the next time you saw me, you wouldn't even know me
'Cause I would be standing tall
Hey, fancy you should answer mine
I only let it ring 10 times, that's all

And you're the last person that I expected
So I know you'd be alone
Oh, I guess you must've picked up your phone
Hey, coincidentally

There's somethings I don't want you to know
Like when you said goodbye, it hurt me so
I'll be strong till the end, I won't break, I won't bend
I just don't think that I'd pretend
Hey, fancy you should find out
The only one true was your best friend

Only you're the last person that I expected
Hard to ever mention it too
Oh, I guess it came to the attention of you
Coincidentally

I let you know
(I let you know)
My way (my way)
Hey (hey)

Accidentally on purpose now (accidentally on purpose now)
Yeah (yeah)
Hey (hey)

I found out (I found out)
Oh (oh)
Coincidentally (coincidentally)

I let you know (I let you know)
My, my, my, my, hey (my, my, my, my, hey)
Well, well, well (well, well, well)

I found out (I found out)
I let you know, yeah (I let you know, yeah)
Accidentally on purpose now (accidentally on purpose now)
