Let's do the dance of life together, oh...
I love the way you move with me, oh...
You are a fascinating rhythm, oh, yeah
And your vibrations set my spirit free

I just wanted to see
You are someone very special to me
You're my destiny, baby
Just like two honeybees
We do the dance of life together
In sweet harmony

Let's make right now the best time ever, oh...
I never felt this way before
You are the magic in my motion, oh...
With every move you make, I love you more

I just wanted to see
You are someone very special to me
You're my destiny, woman
Just like two honeybees
We do the dance of life together
In sweet harmony

Touch my life
It's my life
Rejoice in the music
I am the music
Take me into your heart

Just like two honeybees
We dance in sweet harmony

Let's do the dance of life together, oh, baby
I love the way you move with me, yeah
You are a fascinating rhythm, oh...
Your vibrations set my spirit free

Let's make right now the best time ever, ooh, baby
I never, never felt this way before, yeah
You are the magic in my motion
With every move you make, I love you more

Let's do the dance together, together, together
I love, I love, I love the way you move with me, baby...
