Don't you wish you could fly
Like all the birds in the sky
Everything would last forever
Nothing would ever die
Don't you wish life was easy
And every little thing you need
Was handed on a silver platter
Don't you wish it could be

Well, let me tell you this
It's hard to find
To most of us it's only just
A picture in our minds
Just try to keep your dreams alive

'Cause life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love 'n life
'Cause life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love, that's life

Everybody's got a learn to
Take another look at life
Everybody thinks the grass is
Greener on the other side
If you wanna wind up crazy
Try to figure all this out
Nobody has all the answers
Nobody's gonna show you how

Well, let me tell you this
One day you'll find
Happiness and loneliness
Are all a part of life
Just try to keep your spirits high

Life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love 'n life
'Cause life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love, that's life

(Keep pushin', keep holdin' on)
Push on, hold on, hold on
(Keep pushin', keep holdin' on)
(Keep pushin')

Wouldn't it be so nice
If we had everything we wanted
There would be nothin' left to do
Nothin' left to choose
I'm telling you, I'd really go
Out of my mind
If every wish did come true
Oh, baby

Well, let me tell you this
One day you'll find
Happiness and loneliness
Are all a part of life
Just try to keep your spirits high

Life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love 'n life
'Cause life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love, that's life

Push on, push on
(Keep pushin', keep holdin' on)
Hold on
(Keep pushin', keep holdin' on)
That's love, that's love
Life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love, that's life

Oh, love, that's part of life
Pain, that's part of life
Joy, that's part of life
Tears, that's part of life
Smiles, that's part of life
Love, that's part of life
Love, life

Life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love 'n life
Life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love, that's life
