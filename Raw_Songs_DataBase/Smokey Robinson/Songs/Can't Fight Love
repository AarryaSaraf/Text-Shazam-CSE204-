You may think that you can run and hide
But that won't change the things you feel inside, oh...
You can't hide your love away
'Cause everywhere you go
Love will follow right behind
Baby, don't you know that you...

Can't fight love
Don't you know that you can never win
Can't fight love
Can't fight love, so c'mon, girl, give in

You might as well try to stop the rain
You might as well try to catch the sun
You might as well whistle in the wind
Can't fight love, gotta say it again

(Can't fight love)
Yeah, gotta say it again
(Can't fight love)

You're caught at the point of no return, oh...
You can't go back once all your bridges burn, ooh, yeah
It's bigger than the both of us
So why do you pretend
You may last a round or two
But he'll get you in the end, 'cause you...

Can't fight love, oh...
Don't you know that you can never win
Can't fight love, oh...
Can't fight love, so c'mon, girl, give in

You might as well try to stop the rain
(Might as well)
You might as well try to catch the sun
(You might as well)
You might as well whistle in the wind
Can't fight love, gotta say it again

(Can't fight love)
Yeah, gotta say it again
(Can't fight love)

Oh, can't fight it
Ooh, say it again
Can't fight it
Ooh, say it again

You can't hide your love away
'Cause everywhere you go
Love will follow right behind
Baby, don't you know that you...

Can't fight love, no
Don't you know that you can never win
Can't fight love, yeah
Can't fight love, so c'mon, girl, give in

You might as well try to stop the rain
(You might as well)
You might as well try to catch the sun
(You might as well)
You might as well whistle in the wind
Can't fight love, gotta say it again

(Can't fight love)
Yeah, gotta say it again
(Can't fight love)

Ooh, can't fight it, no
Say it again
(Can't fight love)

You might as well whistle in the wind
Can't fight love, gotta say it again

Ooh, can't fight it

Nobody can fight this feeling alone
(Can't fight love)
Oh...

Nobody can fight this feeling alone
(Can't fight love)
(Can't fight love)

You might as well try to stop the rain
You might as well try to catch the sun
