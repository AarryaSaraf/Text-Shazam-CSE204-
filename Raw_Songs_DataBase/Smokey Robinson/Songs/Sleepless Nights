Come here, baby
Lay down beside me, now, yeah
No time for maybe
Show me like only you know how
You are so sweetly completely
In touch with my fantasy
With everything that you do

Sleepless nights when you're with me, ooh, babe
Feels so right, feels so right, the way it should be
Sleepless nights

Come here, baby
We don't need the light anymore
No time, no time for maybe
Show me what the night is really for
When I'm holding you
Life is unfolding inside of me, ooh...
Whenever I reach for you

Sleepless nights, sleepless, sleepless nights
(Together again)
Together, together
Feels so right, feels so right
(Don't let it end)
Don't you ever let it end
Sleepless nights, when I'm with you
Never so right, but ever so true

Hold me, hold me
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee, oh, baby

Sleepless nights, sleepless, sleepless nights
When you're with me
Feels so right, feel so right
(The way is should be)
Just the way it always will

Ooh, sleepless nights, sleepless nights
(Together again)
Together forever and ever
(Feels so right)
To make things just right as they can be
It just takes the night in you and me
(Don't let it end)
Being together

Sleepless night, sleepless nights
When you're with me...
