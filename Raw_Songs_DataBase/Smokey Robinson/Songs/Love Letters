I called you another letter today
Wish I could let you know what it had to say
Yeah, I wrote every line in the back of my mind
I didn't take the time to pen down

'Cause to write it on paper would do me no good
But since I don't know where to send 'em

Love letters
My life is love letters, baby
I'm a love letter, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
And I'll send myself to you, baby

I wrote some but they're fading now
Soaked with teardrops when they were sealed
Ah, though the sad tears stained message, they contained
But just a look at me can be revealed

Love letters, yeah
My life is love letters, oh baby
So many love letters, oh yeah
And I'll send myself to you, baby

My eyes are deep pools of tears
Deep enough for my soul to drown
And my face will explain how much my heart's in pain
There's really no need for me to write it down

Love letters, yeah
My eyes are love letters to you, babe
My lips are love letters, oh baby
My face, a love letter, yeah, yeah

My life, a love letter, yeah
And my heart, a love letter, oh baby
My soul, a love letter, yeah
I'm a love letter, yeah, yeah
And I send myself to you, baby

I feel like a love letter that you
Canceled into your life for fun
And then decided to replace every single trace
Of the living and loving that we had done

Love letters, yeah
I'm a love letter to you, baby
My life, a love letter, ah babe
My soul, a love letter, yeah

I'm a love letter, love letter
I'm a love letter, yeah
I send myself to you, baby

Ooh, love letters send to you, baby
I send myself to you, ooh
Love letters send to you
I send myself to you, yeah

I send myself to you, babe, oh
And I'll write myself to you, babe, oh
I send myself to you, baby, oh
