Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet
But only for one night and no repeat
And maybe you'll go away and never call
And a taste of honey's worse than none at all

Oh little girl, in that case I don't want no part
I do believe that, that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion

So, if you feel like givin' me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Ooh

Maybe you think that love would tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made  for fools
And so it makes you wise to break the rules

Oh little girl
In that case I don't want no part
I do believe that, that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion

So, if you feel like givin' me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh

Oh little girl, In that case I don't want no part
I do believe that, that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion

So, if you feel like givin' me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
Oh, little girl
I second that emotion
 - Ooh little girl I  second that emotion
