Not so important
In the big picture
That the rest of the world
Waits to see
What you're daily decisions
Are gonna be
What you do or don't do
Won't set all the captives free
If you're asking me
You're just my life, that's all

Not a big river
Making your way to the ocean
Carrying dreams as you flow
Don't matter much where you go
What you do or don't do
Won't make all the flowers grow
Oh, if you really wanna know
You're just my life, that's all

You're just my life, that's all
Paparazzi may not consider you
To be someone who's worthy
To be newsworthy

But you're my life
You're my all
You're my winter, summer, spring, and fall
You're my everything
My diamond in the rough
All of the things I could say
Are not enough

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

The world may not even recognize your name
You may not have fortune and fame
The world may not even recognize your face
But I believe, because of you
It's a better place

You're the wonder in what's wonderful to me
You're living proof that a loving truth was meant to be
Every day I pray, I say, "I hope you stay"
Cause you're my life
