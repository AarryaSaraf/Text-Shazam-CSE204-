Now I lay me down to love you tonight
But will you feel the same in the morning light?

Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Yeah, tonight the light of love is in your eyes, yeah
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Oh, can I believe the magic of your charms?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
(You don't have t say a word to let me know)
Oh, you say, you say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken, ooh...
When the night meets the morning sun?

Oh, love so beautiful
I'd like to think that you'd be mind forever

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
Oh, so tell, tell
Tell me now and I won't ask again
No, no, no, no
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Will you still love me tomorrow?
Yeah, yeah
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
