I do believe my mom and my dad must
Have been the happiest couple that I've ever seen
He used to bring her flowers or a gift just
Because the sky was blue and the grass was green
But I can recall
The night that daddy came and shocked us all
Said this is goodbye
Through both their tears
I remember momma asking why, he said...

Love don't give no reason
Love don't give guarantee
Love may last a season
Or love may last eternally
See, love don't change for you or me
Just to know about love
I just don't know about love
Nobody knows

Sometimes a man just out to have a good time
Can meet somebody who captures his heart and mind
Sometimes a woman who's faithful to her man can still
Fall for somebody else against her own will
We were two lovers
I thought that I was doing everything right for you
But you found another
And when I asked you what I did
Or what I didn't do, you said...

Love don't give no reason
Love don't give guarantee
Love may last a season
Or love may last eternally
See, love don't change for you or me
Just to know about love
Just don't know about love, ooh...

Love is like lightning
You don't know when or where it's gonna strike
Love can be frightening
Sometimes you love somebody that you don't even like

Love don't give no reason
Well, well, well
Love don't give guarantee, ooh...
Love may last a season, oh...
Or love may last eternally
See, love don't change for you or me
Just to know about love
Just don't know about love

Don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know
Just don't know about love, ooh...

Love don't give no reason, well
Love don't give guarantee, no, no
Love may last a season, oh...
Or love may last eternally
See, love don't change for you or me
Just to know about love

Nobody knows about love
Don't know, don't know, don't know
Don't know, don't know, don't know
Don't know about love
Just don't know about love...
