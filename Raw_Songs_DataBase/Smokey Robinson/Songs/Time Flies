Break of day
Why you coming so fast
Go away
I don't want to have to leave her yet

Here we lay 
And we want it to last
We'll take every extra second we can get

Have you ever been involved
Doing something
And you don't want it to stop
You hope it's never done

Like the old saying goes
Everybody knows
Time flies when you're having fun

Father time

Won't you slow down tonight
Mother Nature
Is taking her course

You know I'm feeling more than alright
And my lovin' baby
You're the loving source

Have you ever been involved
Doing something
And you don't want it to stop
You hope it's never done

Like the old saying goes
Everybody knows
Time flies when you're having fun
