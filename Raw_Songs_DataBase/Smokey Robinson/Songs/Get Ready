I'm gonna stay, baby
Stay with you, baby, oh...
Stay with you, baby, oh...
Stay with you, baby, yeah
I got to stay with you, baby

Get ready, here I come
Get ready, here I come

I never met a girl who makes me feel
The way that you do, you're alright
Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real
I say that you do, you're outta sight

So, fee-fi-fo-fum
Look out baby, 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready, baby
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, get ready 'cause here I come

(Get ready 'cause here I come)
Baby, I'm on my way
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
I'm gonna stay
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
Yes, I am
(Get ready 'cause here I come)

If all my friends should want you too
I understand it, be alright
But I hope I get to you before they do
The way I planned it, be outta sight

Oh, tiddley-dee, tiddley-dum
Look out baby, 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready, baby
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, get ready 'cause here I come

(Get ready 'cause here I come)
Baby, I'm on my way
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
Baby, I'm gonna stay
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
Yeah, baby, once I get there, yeah
(Get ready 'cause here I come)

I'll be going nowhere
I'm gonna stay
I wanna stay, baby

Stay, baby
Stay, baby
I'm gonna stay, baby
Feel that rhythm
(Get ready)

Stay with you, baby, oh...
Stay with you, baby, oh...
Stay with you, baby, yeah
I got to stay with you, baby

Get ready, here I come
Get ready, here I come

Stay with you, baby, yeah
I got to stay with you, baby

Well, well, well, well, well, well

I never met a girl who makes me feel
The way that you do, you're alright
Yeah, baby, you're alright, alright, alright...
