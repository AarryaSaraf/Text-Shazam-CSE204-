Hold on, hold on

Hold on to your love as tight as you can
Love your lover just as right as you can
When the road gets rough and goin' gets tough
Hold on to your love as tight as you can

I had a woman who loved me truly
She took her heart and soul and gave them to me
But so for granted, I took her love
Till she decided she'd had enough
And then one morning when I woke up
There I was alone
That's how I know to tell you

Hold on to your love as tight as you can
Love your lover just as right as you can
When the road gets rough and goin' gets tough
Hold on to your love as tight as you can

Hold on to your love with all of your might
You can never hold your lover too tight
You can lose so much when love loses touch
Hold on to your love as tight as you can

Hold on, ooh, hold on
Hold on, lovers hold on

In love's beginning, we can't see it ending
We're too caught up in the happy hours we're spending
But if you don't keep wood on the fire
To keep the flames of love growing higher
Your lover still may burn with desire
But only to leave
That's why I'm tell you to

Hold on to your love as tight as you can
Love your lover just as right as you can
When the road gets rough and goin' gets tough
Hold on to your love as tight as you can

Hold on to your love with all of your might
You can never hold your lover too tight
You can lose so much when love loses touch
So hold on to your love as tight as you can

Hold on to your lover tight as you can
You'll find that true love's in the bush
And not worth one in the hand
Hold on, you better
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, lovers hold on
Break it on down now, fellas

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Lovers hold on
Hold on to your lover
Hold on, hold on

Now I want somebody to tell me
What should you do if you really love your lover?

Hold on
Tell me, tell me, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Lover hold on...
