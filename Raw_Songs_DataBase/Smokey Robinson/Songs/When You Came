When you came
Warm and tender and bittersweet
And surrendered to the love I had to give
I started to live, ooh, yeah, pretty baby

When you came, baby
Satisfaction was a dream fulfilled
Our reaction was so positive and I've
Never felt so alive

I never lived until you came
Ooh, baby
My life has never been the same

I blew my mind
Like a rocket at the end of countdown
Made my heart beat like a thousand drums
To each others and then some
All that happened to me

Yeah, when you came
For a moment, we were all there was
Nothing else existed, not the earth or the sky
Just you and I

I never lived until you came
Oh, baby, no
My life has never been the same
Ooh, baby, yeah

I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came

My, my, my, my, my
My life has never been the same
I, I, I, I, I
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came

Ooh, I never lived until you came
Ooh, baby, no
My life has never been the same
Ooh, baby, yeah
I never lived until you came

I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
My life has never been the same

I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
