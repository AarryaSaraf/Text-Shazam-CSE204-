Jasmin has been running around in circles
Doing crazy things
Jasmin has been idolized by common men
Sought after by kings
She's a lady fair with whom they would share
Their every, every dream
She's a bundle of joy love
She's a femme supreme

Jasmin, well, has in her eyes such a look of love
One glance can turn you out
Jasmin, I've been thinking things since I saw you
I never thought about
Just one look from you was all it took
To make my insides melt
If I read you right, your eyes said you might
Feel the same way that I felt

In my dream, you see, you belong to me
And it makes me feel so proud
But in reality, to you I just may be
Another longing face in the crowd

Ooh you're feeling me so, baby
Making me love you
How much you don't even know, baby
But you'd better believe
My love is only meant for you

Jasmin, Jasmin, Jasmin
No need in asking
You know that I love you
Even if we never speak
Know that I love you, Jasmin
Know that I need you so
Know that I want you
I know you know

Jasmin, Jasmin, Jasmin
No need in asking
You know that I love you
You know you make me so weak
