I waited 'til I saw the sun
Don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
Don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
You'll be on my mind forever

I would cross the angry sea
Die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
You'll be on my mind forever

Something has to make you run
Don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
Don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
