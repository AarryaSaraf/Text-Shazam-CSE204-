Really gonna miss you
It's really gonna be different without you
Time is gonna be hard and slow
For the rest of my life
I'm gonna be thinking about you
(Yes, I am)
Time came when you had to go

I'll miss you my buddy
I'll miss you my friend
I promise my love for you will never end

In your finest hour, I was there with you
And without you things won't be the same
But there's a higher power that we answer to
And you heard Him calling your name

Really gonna miss you
Everything about you, your smiling face
I know you want us all to be strong

Really gonna miss you
I know you're gone to that magic place
Singing you a brand new song

I'll miss you my buddy
I'll miss you my friend
I promise my love for you will never end

I'll miss you my buddy
I'll miss you my friend
I promise my love for you will never end

Really gonna miss You
