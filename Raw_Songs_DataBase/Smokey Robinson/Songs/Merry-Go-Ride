If you could only let me in
I know that love, it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you

Yes, and take you on a merry-go-ride of love, oh...
A spinning, turning, floating on air kind of love

Come on, give in, baby, come with me
Your troubled mind and hang-ups, I'll set them free
Come into me, 'cause I'm into you
Unleash your massive passion, let love come through

Yes, and take you on a merry-go-ride of love, oh...
A spinning, turning, floating on air kind of love

Don't you want to ride
Don't you want to ride

Yeah, take you on a merry-go-ride of love
A spinning, turning, floating on air kind of love
Yeah, take you on a merry-go-ride of love
A spinning, turning, floating on air kind of love

Don't you want to ride
Don't you want to ride
Don't you want to ride
Don't you want to ride
Don't you want to ride

(Ride)
Yeah, on a merry-go-ride of love
(Ride)
Yeah, ride on a merry-go-ride of love

I'll take you on a merry-go-ride of love
A spinning, turning, floating on air kind of love
Take you on a merry-go-ride of love, yes
A spinning, turning, floating on air kind of love

Yes, I'll take you on a merry-go-ride of love
A spinning, turning, floating on air kind of love
Take you on a merry-go-ride of love
A spinning, turning, floating on air kind of love
Take you on a merry-go-ride of love...
