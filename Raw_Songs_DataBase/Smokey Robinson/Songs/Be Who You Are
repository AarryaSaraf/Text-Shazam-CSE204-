Just be yourself, you know that actually
Put-ons are turn-offs and you are so naturally
Sexy without a try, it's unintentional
Naturally flowing and making you sensual
Don't change, baby, don't change
Trust me, just be you

To me, you be who you are
That's good enough for me
To me, you see you're the way
I want my woman to be

Something you've got seems to be making me
More and more into you
Your unmistakably just what I want for me
Nobody's perfect, so we have our ups and downs
But you make it worth it so
Don't change, baby, don't change
Trust me, just be you

To me, you be who you are
That's good enough for me
To me, you see you're the starlight
In my galaxy

Don't change, baby, don't change
Trust me, just be you
Well, well

To me, you be who you are
That's good enough for me
Well, well
To me, you see you're the way
I want my woman to be
I want my woman to be
I want my woman to be

I want my woman to be
Said, I want my woman to be
I want my woman to be
Just the way you are
I want my woman to be
Just the way you are
Don't change, baby
Baby, don't change
I want my woman to be
Just the way you are...
