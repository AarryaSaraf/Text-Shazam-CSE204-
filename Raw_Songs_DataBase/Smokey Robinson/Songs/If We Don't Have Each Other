Wake up in the mornin'
And there's love layin' there
Take up where we left off
Feel like stayin' there

Can't imagine ever bein' without you
You know you got everything I think I'll ever need
I love every little thing about you, baby

Tell me, what do we have
If we don't have each other?
We don't have anything
If we don't have each other
Tell me, tell me, tell me (Tell me, what do we have)
Not nothin' (If we don't have each other?)
We don't have anything at all (We don't have anything)
Without each other (If we don't have each other)

I love it when we snuggle
When you're holdin' onto me
We're like two pieces of a puzzle
We fit together perfectly
We come to a meeting
Yeah, at the perfect junction
So close, so tight
We need each other to full function
Ooh, baby, baby

We got you, we got me
We got us, we got we
We got love to make
We got love to make

Tell me, tell me (Tell me, what do we have)
Nothin' at all, nothin' at all (If we don't have each other?)
We don't have anything at all (We don't have anything)
(If we don't have each other)
Tell me, tell me (Tell me, what do we have)
A bunch of nothin' (If we don't have each other?)
Without each other, we got nothin', baby (We don't have anything)
(If we don't have each other)

Without you, I'm not whole
You're my heart, you're my soul
You're my soulmate
You're my soulmate
Ooh, ooh

Nobody has ever made me feel
Like you do, hey
I love it when you say I make you feel
That same way too
Ooh

Tell me (Tell me, what do we have)
We got nothin', baby, nothin' (If we don't have each other?)
We don't have anything at all, baby (We don't have anything)
Without each other (If we don't have each other)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby (Tell me, what do we have)
Oh, baby (If we don't have each other?)
Nothin', nothin', nothin' (We don't have anything)
Don't you agree? (If we don't have each other)
