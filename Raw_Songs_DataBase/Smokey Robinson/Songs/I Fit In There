Let me in your life
Make some room for me
If deep down inside, you're hoping
To fill up an opening

I fit in there
I fit in there
I fit in there

If empty fills up your private place
And nothing and no one can penetrate
If you got an inner vacancy
Baby, then make it a place for me

I fit in there
I fit in there
I fit in there

Oh baby, now
I'm watching and waiting and
Anticipating and
First opening
I'm gonna strike
If you don't wanna be in love
Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?

If you got one whole hour
One whole day, if you got one whole life
I don't have a crystal ball, I can't do future reads
But I know when it comes to all
Your future needs

I fit in there
I fit in there
I fit in there
I fit in there

Open up, let me in
Let's let you and me begin
I fit in there
I fit in there

Oh baby, now
Oh baby, now
Oh baby, now

Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?

Oh baby, now
Oh baby, now
Oh baby
