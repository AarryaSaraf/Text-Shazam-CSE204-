Darlin', tonight was such heavenly bliss
And I have never known a sweeter kiss
But we both know that I was just for fun
'Cause I the kind of a guy who's always on the run

My love is just passing through
My love is just passing through
My love is just passing through
Through your heart

The waters of love are much too deep
Don't wanna make any promises I can't keep
The world outside is calling to me
Your love is good, but I've got to be free

My love is just passing through
Hey, my love is just passing through
Ooh, my love is just passing through
Through your heart

Your gentle lips seem to beg me not to go
But if I hesitate, your tears may show
We both agree to forgive and forget
And there would never be any tears of regret

My love is just passing through
Oh, my love is just passing through
Babe, my love is just passing through your heart

Just passing through
Just passing through
Just passing through your heart
Ooh, yeah

My love is just passing through
Just passing through
My love is just passing through
Just passing through, ooh...
My love is just passing through
Just passing through

Just passing through
Baby, my love is just passing through
Babe, my love is just passing through
Just passing through...
