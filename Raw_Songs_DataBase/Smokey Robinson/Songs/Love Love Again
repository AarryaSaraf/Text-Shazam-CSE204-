Baby, yeah, yeah

I want to love you, teach me how
Just open you heart to me somehow
Somehow, right now, right now
'Cause I want to show you
What a real love's like
Whatever was wrong, I'll make it right
I will, I will, I will
And, darling, don't be afraid
Of the feelings you keep deep inside

I'll make you love love again
Yes, I will, yes, I will
Show you that we'll never end
Never, no, never, never
Swear I can dry every tear you cry
I'll make you love love
Gonna love love again, again

I'll always want you, you know I will
And I'll keep your heart from standing still
I will, I will, yes
And, baby, I'll make you see
You're a woman who wants to be loved by me

I'll make you love love again
Show you that we'll never end
Never, never end
Swear I can dry every tear you cry
(I swear, every tear you cry)
I'll make you love love again

And all night, I'll take it slow
'Til we find a place that we both want to go
And, baby, I'll never stop
'Til you can feel this love filling up your heart

I'll make you love love again
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Show, show you that we'll never end
I will show you, show you, show you
Swear I can dry every tear you cry
(Ooh, every tear you cry)
I'll make you love love, love again

I'll make you love love again
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me
You're gonna love love again
Come on, love me, love me, love me, love, me, love me...
