Beggars can't be choicey I know
That's what the people say.
But though my heart is begging for love
I've turned some love away.

Maybe one was true love I'll never know which cause
your love is the only love to make this beggar rich.
I'm a choosy beggar (choosy beggar)
and your my choice.

People say you can't have your cake
and then eat it too.
They tell me I've been making a mistake
waiting around for you.
Oh, I'm begging for love and
why can't they see that yours is the only love for me

I'm a choosy beggar (choosy beggar)
and your my choice.

If beg you I must then I'll never give up cause
your love is the only love to fill this beggars cup.

I'm a choosy beggar (choosy beggar)
and your my choice.
