It's a sad time
There's no more love left in it
It's a bad time
There's no good way to quit it
There's a heartache coming, yes, I know
You'd think I
You'd think I'd just let it go, but no

I remember the good times
The love we shared together
You and me times
It just couldn't get no better
But I can't keep holding memories
They don't touch me
But they just won't let me be

Am I a fool to believe
That this love could last longer
Am I a fool If I leave
When this love could grow stronger
What do you do when you know
That your love's breaking down
Do you walk away, do you turn it around, oh...

It's a sad time
It's a bad, bad, bad time

Am I a fool to believe
That this love could last longer
Am I a fool If I leave
When this love could grow stronger
What do you do when you know
That your love's breaking down
Do you walk away, turn it around, oh...

It's a sad time
There's no more love left in it
It's a bad time
No good way to quit it
It's a sad, sad, sad time, yeah
It's a bad, bad, bad time, ooh, yeah
Sad, sad, sad time, yeah
Bad, bad, bad time, ooh, yeah
Sad time, sad time
No more love left in it
