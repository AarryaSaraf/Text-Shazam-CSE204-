You can't be my enemy because Jesus told me to love you
No matter how you try me  you're gonna be loved by me
Because Jesus told me to love you

The lamb who is our shepard too has proven his love for you
Come on now, take your place in his meadowland of grace
Where I know you'll surely find comfortness and peace of mind
If we just accept His love
He'll never disown us and eternal life is a bonus

You can't be my enemy because Jesus told me to love you (well now)
No matter how you try me  you're gonna be loved by me
Because Jesus told me to love you

Take that hate away from here
Let's create a new atmosphere
Where we recognize the fact
That hate can only hold us back
If we do what Jesus said
Give each other love instead
This could be a better place
For us to raise our children
We just have to do His will here

You can't be my enemy because Jesus told me to love you (well now)
No matter how you try me  you're gonna be loved by me
Because Jesus told me to love you
(Well now) No matter how you try me
You're gonna be loved by me
(Because Jesus) because Jesus told me to love you (oh)

Well, I'll just have to pray for you rather than to hold a grudge
I am but the witness God will be the judge
You can't be my enemy (my enemy) because Jesus told me to love you (told me to love you)
I have no choice since I heard His voice
Jesus told me I've got to love you (I've got to love you)
(Well now) (You can't be) You can't be (my enemy) (no no no no)
(Jesus told me) Jesus told me to love you
You know that I (I have no choice) have no choice (since I heard His voice) (ooh)
Since I heard His voice (Jesus) Jesus (told me) told me to love
Jesus told me told me to love you
(Jesus told me told me to love you)
Jesus told me told me to love you
(Jesus told me told me to love you)
Jesus told me told me to love you
(Jesus told me told me to love you)
(Told me) I got to love you
Jesus told me to love you
