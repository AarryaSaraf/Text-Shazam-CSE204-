I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I'm only payin' the price
For a trip I took to paradise
'Cause I looked into a pair of eyes
And what I thought was the look of love

Was only hurt in disguise
Too bad I didn't realize
Oh,but don't apologize
No, 'cause

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
I should've did it myself
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I think it's pretty plain
Holdin' you would take a ball and chain
Every bet I made was all in vain
'Cause what I thought was an ocean of love

Was just a wee drop of rain
Too bad that it couldn't rain
Oh but you don't have to explain
No, 'cause

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
I should've did it myself
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
That's the thing to do
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I said, what I thought was sure to last, to last
Was just a minute instead, too bad that I got misled
Ah but you don't have to hang your head
No, 'cause

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
I should've did it myself
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
'Cause that's the thing to do
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
