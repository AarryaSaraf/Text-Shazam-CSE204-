Ever had a dream to come true
Well, I have and it still feels like
I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Ever wished for love on a star above, ooh...
And it came right up to you and said, "now how do you do"

Well, there's nothing like something to come true, hey
Something you admire, baby, and it belongs to you
Well, there's nothing like something that's for real, hey
Something you can hold in your arms
Something that you can feel
Right on, baby

Ever been involved to a certain extent
Surprise, because when you jumped into the situation
You had another intent, altogether
Ever been in real deep over your head
And found out that the one you thought was hit and run
Would be forever instead
Right on, baby, yeah

Well, there's nothing like something to come true, yeah
Something you admire, baby, and it belongs to you
Well, there's nothing like something that's for real, yeah
Something you can hold in your arms
Something that you can feel, feel, feel
Right on, baby, yeah

Ooh, baby, yeah
Ooh, yeah, oh...
Right on, baby, yeah

Well, there's nothing like something to come true, yeah
Something you admire, baby, and it belongs to you
Well, there's nothing like something that's for real, yeah
Something you can hold in your arms
Something that you can feel, feel, feel
And there's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Like something to come true
And for me, baby, that's you
