Oh, my darling
Where are you tonight
Our situation wasn't really wrong
But it was not quite right
It hurts so much to say goodbye
Still I'm so glad we met
'Cause you're easy to love
Hard to forget

I really miss you
But then I knew I would
We had some rough edges that needed smoothing
But the good times were really good
Oh, we didn't make it this time
And that's my one regret
'Cause you're easy to love
Hard to forget
I say you're easy to love
Hard to forget

Oh, you won't release me
Release me, release me
I can't get over you
I'll always love you
You will be in my heart
No matter what you do
I keep saying it'll be better tomorrow
Tomorrow ain't come yet
You're easy to love
Hard to forget
I say easy to love
Hard to forget

You're easy, easy, easy to love
Gotta come back
Oh-oh, hard to forget
Easy to love, hard
Yes, baby, gotta come back
Yes, come back, come back, come back
Gotta come back
Easy to love, yes, baby...
