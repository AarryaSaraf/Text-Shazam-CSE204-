Why, why, why, why

That old river needed crossing
Those dice needed tossing
It probably ended up costing
Somebody something just to do
And I think you need to be loved by me, that's why
Oh, I think you need to be loved by me
That's why, why, why
Oh, baby, that's why, why, why
I'm willing to pay the price just for loving you

That old wall needed scaling
That sea needed sailing
Somebody took a chance on failing
Just to prove it could be done
And I think you need to be loved by me, that's why
Oh, baby, I think you need to be loved by me
That's why, why, why
Oh, baby, that's why, why, why
I'm chancing loving you 'cause you're the one

Ah, baby

Well, we all have our own reasons
Why we do the things we do
Something that makes it
Real important to you

Why, why

That old mountain needed climbing
Some inner need is why men
Have to put some time in
If you wanna make a dream come true
And I gotta inner need to be loved by you, that's why
Oh, mama, gotta inner need to be loved by you
That's why, why, why
Oh, baby, that's why, why, why
I'm puttin' in my time to try to make you love me too
Ah, baby

Why, why

I gotta inner need to be loved by you, that's why
I think you need to be loved by me, that's why
Oh, I gotta inner need to be loved by you, that's why
I think you need to be loved by me, that's why

Why, why, mama, mama, that's why, why, why, why, why
I gotta inner need to be loved by you, that's why
I think you need to be loved by me, that's why
Oh, baby, that's why, mama, mama, that's why...
