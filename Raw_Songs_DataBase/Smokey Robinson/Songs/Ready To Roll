Come on...
Yeah, yeah...

I'm ready to roll, roll, roll, roll
Ready to roll, my love is for real
I'm ready to roll, roll, roll, roll

Yesterday, I had a vision, baby, yeah
A vision of you and me together, Lord, have mercy
We were wrapped in a sweet, sweet love, yeah
Soaked in rain from the skies above

Now I don't wanna rush you, baby, but I can't ignore
These feelings are growing for you, baby, more and more
I want you bad, baby, I can see it so clear
(I want you so bad, so bad)
If you feel what I feel, then here is the deal
I'll let you steer

I'm ready to roll with you, baby, ooh...
I'm ready to ride, baby, all night long
I'm ready to cruise with you, baby, come on
Girl, are you comin', my motor's runnin'
Waiting for you

I'm ready to roll with you, baby, ooh...
(I'm ready to roll, roll, roll with you, mama)
I'm ready to ride, baby, all night long
I'm ready to cruise with you, baby, come on, hey
Girl, are you comin' with me, my motor's runnin'
I'm waiting for you

I would never disrespect you, my lady, no
Girl, I promise to be honest, and I will, baby
I've been waiting for quite some time
Baby, I need you, I really need you to make up your mind

Ooh, baby, please, don't make me get down on my knees
Ooh, please, don't make me beg, ooh, baby
(I beg you, babe)
The way you move around me drives me wild
I get turned on by your simple smile

I don't wanna rush you, baby, but I can't ignore
These feelings are growing stronger for you more and more
I want you bad, bad, bad, baby, right now, right here
(I want you so bad, so bad)
If you feel what I feel, here is the deal
I'll let you steer

I'm ready to roll with you, baby, ooh...
(Roll, roll)
I'm ready to ride, baby, all night long
(Yes, all night)
I'm ready to cruise with you, baby, come on, come on
Girl, are you comin', my motor's runnin'
Oh, I'm waiting for you...
