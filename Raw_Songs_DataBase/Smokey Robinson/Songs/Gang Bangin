Wasting your time
Drinking that wine
Smoking that smoke
Doing that coke
Dealing that dope
Giving up hope
Gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin

Staying out late
Preaching that hate
Defying your mother
Killing your brother
Killing in waves
Filling up graves
Gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin (oh yeah)

(You know that)
Widows are crying
Babies are dying
A child at play
Got in the way
Innocent children
Somebody killed them
Gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin

Whatcha thinking now, whatcha doing
Just how many lives do you have to ruin
Gang bangin (owe) (break it down)

I betcha you don't even know how it started
How you came to be in this position
Hate was handed down by somebody
It's just the neighborhood no good hand me down been around tradition
A neighborhood no good hand me down been around tradition
Your killing each other for tradition, tradition

Sometimes I think that you would if you could (uh-huh) and that would be good (uh-huh)
But homie won't let you (uh-huh) for he's gonna get you (uh-huh)
But maybe if you stop (uh-huh) it might make a few stop
Gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin

I heard that somebody said (uh-huh) god is dead (uh-huh)
Leaving you free to (uh-huh) continue to be you (uh-huh)
But I guarantee you (uh-huh) god can see you (uh-huh)
I guarantee you (uh-huh) god can see you
This gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin
Gang bangin now, gang bangin, gang bangin
Gang bangin (yeah), gang bangin now

Love thy neighbor as thy self
Put those weapons on the shelf
Use your life for something else positive
You know that gang bangin ain't no way to live
(Ooh) (gang bangin) gang bangin (now) gang bangin
Gang banging now (yeah) (alright) (yeah, yeah) (gang bangin) gang bangin (now)
