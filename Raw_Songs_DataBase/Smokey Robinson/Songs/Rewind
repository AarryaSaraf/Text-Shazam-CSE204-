Kisses sweet as marmalade
Two lovers who had it made
Not a dark cloud in sight
Everything seemed so right

Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time

A small apartment two could share
Overdone cooking nobody cares
Tastes like caviar
Because of where we are

Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Well, well, well
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time

Where are you now and where am I
Said that you would never say goodbye

Take me back to yesterday
Yester feeling yester way
Holding someone tight
Morning, moon and night

Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, rewind
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Take me back there now
...
