This may take me all night long
I hope you're prepared to stay
Let's put on our favorite song
Let's put all our cares away

If you wanna make love
If you wanna make heartache and frustration disappear
If you wanna make time
If you wanna make more than conversation

Come 'round here
Oh, baby
(Come 'round here)
Baby, why don't you
(Come 'round here)
Come 'round here, babe, come 'round here

Make some hurt and make some joy
Make yourself a few mistakes
Make up, make fun, make believe
There are many makes you can make

But when you wanna make love
When you wanna make heartache and frustration disappear
When you wanna make time
And more than conversation

Come 'round here
Baby, baby, why don't you
(Come 'round here)
Come 'round with me, baby
(Come 'round here)
Come 'round here, babe, come 'round here

Yeah, when you wanna make love
When you wanna make heartache and frustration disappear
When you wanna make time
More, more, baby

Come round here
Baby, baby, why don't you
(Come 'round here)

When you wanna make love
Heartache and frustration disappear
Time, time
More than conversation

Come round here
Oh, baby, why don't you
(Come 'round here)

When you wanna make love...
