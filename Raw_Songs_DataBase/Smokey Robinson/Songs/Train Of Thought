Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought
Come on, baby
Know my mind inside
Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, oh...
Come on, baby
You've got a ticket to ride

I've got a one track mind
Headed in your direction
The wheels keep on turning
Every thought concerning
What I can do to get me next to you

Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought
Ride, ride, ride
Come on, baby
Know my mind inside
Oh, come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, oh...
Oh, come on, baby
You've got a ticket to ride

Tune in on my wavelength
The power of my suggestion
Mental instigations
Intimate vibrations
Calling to me through telepathy

Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought
Come on and ride, come on and ride
Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, ooh...

Come on, ride, ride
Come on, ride, ride, baby

Come on, ride, ride, baby, ride
Come on, ride, ride

Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, ooh...
Come on, baby
Know my mind inside
Oh, come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, oh...
Come on, baby
You've got a ticket to ride, ride

Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, oh, yeah
Come on, baby
Know my mind inside, oh...
Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, ride, ride
Come on, baby
You've got a ticket to ride...
