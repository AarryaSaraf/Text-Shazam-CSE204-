I wanna know your body like it was my own
All night, is that alright?
I wanna know your body like it was my own
Every part, a beautiful sight
I wanna sing about it in a sweet love song
Clever words I wanna write
I wanna make the music all night long
While I'm holdin' you tight

What would be my dream come true
Is for me to be with you
All the things that we could do
Yeah, to make each other feel good

I wanna know your body like it was my own
If it's not asking too much
Well I wanna have your body answer like a telephone
In response to my touch
I wanna touch your body with passion
Every curve, every line
And I wanna make your body glow from head to toe
Light it up like a neon sign

Every time you walk my way
I know what I wanna do
Even if I don't know what to say
I'm thinkin', maybe one day
Ooh, we'll make each other feel good (feel good)

Ooh

Every time you walk my way
I know what I wanna do
Even if I don't know what to say
I'm thinkin' maybe one day
Ooh, we'll make each other feel good (feel good)

I wanna know your body like it was my own
If that's alright
Maybe one day, I might
