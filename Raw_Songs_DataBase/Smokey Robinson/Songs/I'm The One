You were trapped in a room of doubt
You had no way out
You were fighting to make it work
But you lost that bout
You fell in my arms all brokenhearted
Making me feel our time has started
I know, you never thought that I'd come thru
I did what anybody else, somebody would do

I'm the one who pulled you from the fire, yeah
I'm the one who saved you from the fall, oh...
I'm the one who risked his heart to be your all and all
Remember, I'm the one who came to the rescue, oh...

You were drowning your life away
In a sea of tears
Always searching for happiness
In the eyes of your peers
So I threw out my heart like a cowboy rope
You told me that I was your one last hope
I know, you think I'm just a fantasy
But please don't forget about me, baby

I'm the one who pulled you from the fire, oh, yeah
I'm the one who saved you from the fall, uh-huh
I'm the one who risked his heart to be your all and all
Remember, I'm the one who came to the rescue

You let your heart be left
Way out there on a limb
You never thought I'd be your hero
A hero I am not
But I gave you all the love I've got
So if the choice is him or me
Think about it carefully

I'm the one, girl, I pulled you from the fire
I'm the one, yes, saved you from the fall
I'm the one who risked his heart to be your all and all
Remember, I'm the one who came to the rescue

I'm the one who pulled you from the fire, yes
I'm the one who saved you from the fall, saved you
I'm the one who risked his heart to be your all and all
(Let me be good)
Remember, I'm the one who came to the rescue
