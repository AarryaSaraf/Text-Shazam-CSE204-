When I had you to myself
I didn't even want you 'round
But those pretty faces always make you 
Stand out in a crowd
Somebody picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
And now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
And now since I see you in his arms
I want you back
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back

Oh

Ooh

Trying to live without your love 
Brought on sleepless nights
Let me show you, woman
That I know wrong from right

Every street you walk on 
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the woman
I didn't even want around 

Oh baby, give me one more chance 
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me 
Back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go 
And now since I see you in his arms
I want you back 
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back

Oh

Oh, oh

Oh baby, give one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
And now since I see you in his arms
I want you back
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back

I want you back 
I, I, I, I gotta have you back
I gotta have your lovin'
I gotta have your lovin'
I, I, I, want you back, baby 
I want you back, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Please come on back 
Please come on back 
Please come on back 
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Please come on back 
...
