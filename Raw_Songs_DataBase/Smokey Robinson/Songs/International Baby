Fraulein, lips like cherry wine
Kissed me and then we were in Berlin
Senorita, no love could be sweeter
Lovin' that lets me go to Spain and Mexico

You're my international baby
I don't mean maybe, no
To me you're every woman in this world
You're my girl

Polynesian flower, you're the lady of the hour
No one makes Honolulu like I know you do
Little lotus blossom, no sense playin' possum
Together, you know we go lovin' in Tokyo

You're my international baby
I don't mean maybe, no
To me you're every woman in this world
You're my girl

You're my international baby
I don't mean maybe, no
To me you're every woman in this world
You're my girl

Soft and sweet
Yeah

Sweet bird with every tender word
You're takin' me on down to London town
Sister, sister, sister
I'm the envy of every mister
Rhode Island to San Diego
They envy me 'cause they know

You're my international baby
I don't mean maybe, no
To me you're every woman in my world
You're my girl

You're my international baby
Don't mean maybe, oh
To me you're every woman in my world
You're my girl

You're my international baby
Don't mean maybe, no
To me you're every woman in my world
You're my girl

Soft and sweet...

You're my international baby...
