Walking around talking about you
Don't miss what you had before
Heavy on pride, light on love
Claiming you came to do anything
But to see me once more, oh, baby
Heavy on pride, light on love

So you say you stopped by
To make sure I watered creeping Charlie
And to use the phone
Oh, but that ain't so
Baby, 'cause I know you well enough
To know that kind of stuff
Couldn't bring you home
I think you miss what we had
And, ooh, I need you so bad, baby

Oh, give it up, baby
Oh, give it up, baby

Walking around talking about
You're in need of nobody
Ooh, that's heavy
Heavy on pride, light on love
Claiming you aim to do nothing
To satisfy your body, ooh...
That's heavy on pride, but light on love

It's a natural thing
So if your body's aching for me
Baby, don't be shamed
'Cause there's no use to make an excuse
Just look at me and you've got to see
That I feel the same
Said I'm glad you came to get your lover's touch
And, ooh, I need you so much, baby, oh...

Never mind wasting time
Talking about who did who wrong
Heavy on pride, light on love
Heavy on pride, on pride, but light on love
Heavy on pride, light on love

Give it up, baby
Oh, come on, give it up, baby

Ooh, I need you so bad, I need you so bad, baby

Never mind wasting time
Talking about who did who wrong
Heavy on pride, light on love
Heavy on pride, on pride, but light on love
Yeah, light on it, light on it, light on love

Ooh, baby...

Play for me, y'all
Yeah

On a lonely night when you get uptight
You can't love pride
When you're living a lie
With your head up high
But you're hurting inside
That's heavy, baby
I said, that's heavy, baby
