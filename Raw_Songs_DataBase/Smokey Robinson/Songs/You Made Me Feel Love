Well, well, well...

I say yes, I've been blessed
I couldn't begin to count the times I've said
Hey, do you know how good you make me feel
I know you know you do
I know it's all because of you
That I have watched my life turn inside out
Yes, and I've watched as you've become the key
To what my life's about

'Cause you made me feel love
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before
You made me feel touched
Like I've never felt touched before
You made me feel love
And you made me believe in love
Like I never thought I could believe
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before

I say yes, yes I knew
The night I was introduced to you, yes
Do you remember that night as well as I do
I close my eyes and smile
As I roll back to the time
When I touched your hand
And floated off into space
Yes, and all those people down there
Looking up at us and say
Hey, how did you get to feel that way

'Cause you made me feel love
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before
Yeah, you made me feel touched
Like I've never felt touched before
Oh, you made me feel love
And you made me believe in love
Like I never thought I could believe
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before
Love before, love

Oh, you made me feel love
You made me feel love
You made me feel love
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before

You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before, no, no, no
You made me feel touched
Like I've never felt touched before, ooh...
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before, ooh...

You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before, well
You made me feel touched
Like I've never felt touched before
(You made me feel love)
Ooh, yeah, you made me feel it
Yeah, you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before
You made me feel touched
Like I've never felt touched before
You made me feel love, made me feel love
Made me feel love...
