You gave me space
Girl, you gave me air
You let me run and rip
And when I've done my trip
You've been waitin' right here
You gave me leeway
You gave me my way
Now you're actin' like
You're 'bout to give me the highway
I better straighten up

It's time to stop shoppin' around
It's time to stop Dukin' of Earl
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
And get myself back in your arms again

I've been a rover
Girl, I've been a mover
You just swallowed your pride
And stood on the side
And let me maneuver, well
You gave me freedom
You gave me rope
I haven't already hung myself I hope
I better straighten up

It's time to stop shoppin' around
Well, it's time to stop Dukin' of Earl
Girl, don't you know
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
And get myself back in your arms again

At first it was nice, takin' Mama's advice
And play the game of pick and choose
But then along came you, and that's when I knew
I'd found that woman that I don't want to lose

My way was a dream
Girl, your way is real
You had to shake me up
Just to wake me up
And show me how I feel, mmm...
I showed you my way
You showed me your way
Now you're actin' like
You're 'bout to show me the doorway
I better straighten up

It's time to stop shoppin' around
Don't you know that
It's time to stop Dukin' of Earl, well
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
And get myself back in your arms again

It's time to stop shoppin' around
(Better stop shoppin' around)
It's time to stop Dukin' of Earl
(Gotta stop Dukin' of Earl)
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
Yeah, and get myself back in your arms again
(Well, well, well)

It's time to stop shoppin' around
Don't you know that
It's time to stop Dukin' of Earl, well
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
And get myself back in your arms again

It's time to stop shoppin' around
(Better stop shoppin' around)
It's time to stop Dukin' of Earl
(Gotta stop Dukin' of Earl)
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
Yeah, and get myself back in your arms again...
