You're all mixed up
You don't know what to do
You talk a lot of stuff
But it's all half true
You know you better get yourself together
Cause your standing on shaky ground
But the lies you've been living can all be forgiven
When you're standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on Jesus

(Well)
You're walking tall
Got your feeble strut
You suddenly fall
From you don't know what
Who, you wonder, pulled the rug out from under
Somebody cool as you
But there's no doubt about it, grounds never solid
Till you're standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on Jesus

(Ooh, yes)

Our father built termination
On a rock foundation
He said my son is the one to do what needs to be done
To help you out in any situation

Well you just can't see
To stay on track
You take two steps left
And three steps back
You're so unstable cause your just unable
To get a good hold on life
You don't know how good it is to be so good
Until you're standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on Jesus
You don't know how good it is to be so good
Until you're standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on
Standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on
Standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on Jesus
Standing on Jesus, standing on god (ooh)
Standing on the Lord (ooh)
Standing on Jesus, standing on Jesus
Standing on the Lord
Standing on the Lord (ooh)
Standing on Jesus
Standing on, standing on, standing on Jesus
