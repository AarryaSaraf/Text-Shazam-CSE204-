Lady, lady, lady
I've been waiting on the sideline
I'd be willing to wait another lifetime
If you promise one day you will be mine

We've been living in my imagination
And way beyond my wildest dreams
If we get together, that'll be the day
When you're more what I feel
You'll see what I mean

Gonna be a passion thing, hotter than an oven
Gonna be totally another kind of lovin'
Gonna be wildfire when our bodies entwine
I don't know if I'll love you all of your life
But I know I'll love you all of mine

Oh, lady, lady, lady
I believe you're my destiny
You've got my mind all slowed up
And when you take the rest of me

Gonna be an intimate way to celebrate
Gonna be a soulful thing 'cause you're my soul mate
Gonna be physical and mental and everything combined
I don't know if I'll love you all of your life
But I know I'll love you all of mine

Yeah, yes, ooh...
Baby, whoo, baby, oh...
I know I'll love you all
Know I'll love you
Know I'll love you all of mine, ooh...

Gonna be a passion thing, hotter than an oven, yes
Gonna be totally another kind of lovin'
(Ooh, another kind)
Gonna be the wild thing when our bodies entwine
I don't know if I'll love you all of your life
But I know I'll love you all of mine

Gonna be an intimate way to celebrate, yeah
Gonna be a soulful thing 'cause you're my soul mate
Gonna be physical and mental, everything combined
I don't know if I'll love you all of your life
But I know I'll love you all of mine...
