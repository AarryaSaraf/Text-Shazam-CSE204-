Love so fine, gonna be so good
Gonna blow your mind
Love so good
Gonna be the talk of the neighborhood
Hey, cuddle up and let it flow
Just let it be and this I know
Love so fine, gonna be so good
Gonna blow your mind
Love so fine, gonna be so good
Gonna blow your mind, baby

Oh, yeah, ooh, baby

Love so real
Gonna be made up of the way we feel
Hey, not a word needs to be said
The touch is heard
Yeah, show and tell, let action speak
And, baby, when we reach the peak
Love so fine, gonna be so good
Gonna blow your mind
Love so fine, gonna be so good
Gonna blow your mind

Ooh, baby
Love so fine, love so fine, love so fine

Now just in case you're not too sure
What the symptoms are

It's love so fine
When you feel chill up and down your spine
(So fine, so fine)
Yeah, you know that's it
When you feel that thrill in your stomach pit
(So fine, so fine)
And like a rollercoaster ride
You get all thrilled up inside
Love so fine, gonna be so good
Gonna blow your mind
Love so fine, gonna be so good
Gonna blow your mind

Yeah, so fine, so fine, so fine
Gonna blow your mind
Oh, so fine, so fine, so fine
Gotta blow your mind
So fine, so fine, gotta blow your mind

Blow, blow, blow, blow your mind
So fine, gotta blow your mind, baby
Love, yeah, gotta blow your mind
Love, ooh, gotta blow your mind
Love, gotta blow your mind
Love so fine, gonna be so good
Blow your mind, baby

Love
(Love, gonna blow your mind)
Love so fine
Gotta blow your mind
