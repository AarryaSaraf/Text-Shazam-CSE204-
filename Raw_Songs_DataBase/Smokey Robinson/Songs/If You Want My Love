Anytime you're feeling lonely
And you need me, I'll be at home
Doesn't matter what I am doing
Call me up on the telephone
I'll pacify, try to take away every problem, baby, oh...
I'm sympathetic and you can cry on my shoulder, baby

If you want my love, I'll be around
Oh, yes, I will
If you want my love, I'll be around
You know I will

Don't you run when you've got someone
Who understands when you're not yourself
It's no fun, seems like just one tear
Can make the time when there's no one else
I might not have a PH degree in psychology, oh, baby
But I recognize what's behind your instantaneously
Instantaneously

If you want my love, I'll be around
Oh, yes, I will
If you need my love, I'll be around
You know I will

Baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
If you need me, I'll be around
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
Oh, baby, oh...

If you want my love, I'll be around
Oh, yes, I will, baby
If you need my love, I'll be around
You know I will

Baby, anytime, anyplace, anywhere

If you want my love, I'll be around
Oh, yes, I will, baby
If you need my love, I'll be around
You know I will...
