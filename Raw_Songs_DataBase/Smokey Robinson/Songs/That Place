That place, deep inside of you
That special place, you give me

That you say is mine exclusively
What you say is my private domain
You've made that so plain
That place deep inside of you
Where no other one is allowed

'Cause it's mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
Makes me feel so proud
What you say is my territory
Is there just for me

Ooh, it's my paradise
Oh, it's my comfort zone
Ooh, it's so very nice
Knowing there's a part of you
That's mine alone

There's no place like that place
Deep inside of you
That's always ready for me
That's so full of love
And you let it flow free
It comes flowing down
Like warm summer rain

Before the feeling's over
Here it comes again
Before the feeleing's over
Here it comes again

There's no place like that place
No place like that place
No place

Wanna tell you that
There's no place like that place
No, no, no, no place
No place like that place
Deep inside of you
