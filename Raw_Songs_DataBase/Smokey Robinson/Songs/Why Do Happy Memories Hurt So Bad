Baby's on the run, there she goes
Somethin' that I've done, I suppose
Made baby cry and now, I'm all alone
I hope by and by, baby will come back home
When I remember, the happiness we had
Why do happy memories hurt so bad
Why do happy memories hurt so bad

Think about the good times, let the bad times fade
That's a good philosophy, but I'm afraid
Good memories only feel good with someone to share them
But when you're alone it's much harder to try to bear them
A thought that makes you smile can still make you sad
Why do happy memories hurt so bad
Why do they hurt so bad, why do they hurt so bad

Occupy your time they tell me, get yourself a hobby
They mean well, but I'm not about to let them rob me
Of the only way I can be with you at all
It's here in my memory and I've got total recall
Even when parting is sweet, it's still sad
Why do happy memories hurt so bad
Why do they hurt so bad
Why do happy memories hurt so bad
Hurt so bad, hurt so bad

Hurt so bad, memories, memories
Memories, memories
Hurt so bad...
