If I told you once, I've told you again
I don't like it
You can have your fun, but don't fool with my head
I won't buy it
Be merciful when you think of me
And try and have some sympathy
'Cause nobody means as much to me
Nobody means as much to me
As you do

If I may recall, you say that you cared
About loving
I never thought I'd see you running scared
From this love thing, yeah
If you understand the things I say
Then there's no cause to be afraid
For nobody can complete the day
Nobody can complete my day
As you do

Nobody can love, ah, nobody can share
No one person can do anything
That hurts me as much
As you do

Play it now

Oh, be merciful when you think of me
And try and have some sympathy
'Cause nobody means as much to me
Nobody means as much to me
As you do, well

As you do, nobody can love me now
As you do, nobody can make me feel as good
As you do, nobody can hurt me quite as much

As you do
As you do, yeah
