A gypsy once told me
That I was on a path of destiny
My gypsy, she told me
That I would catch a star meant for me
Baby, I've been around
I've been kissed a time or two
But my fate of love
Is destiny I never knew

I caught a star, I caught a star
Out there meant for me
You're my star, you're my love
You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny

A glow will find me
And I will love a child born for me
My violin will play
And the child will bring me love and harmony
Oh, baby, we'll spin around
We'll ride a carousel for two
We will pledge our love
My destiny is loving you, ooh...

I caught a star, I caught a star
Out there meant for me
You're my star, you're my love
You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny

Oh, baby, we'll spin around
We'll ride a carousel for two
We will pledge our love
My destiny is loving you, ooh...

I caught a star, I caught a star
Out there meant for me
You're my star, you're my love
You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny

I caught a star, I caught a star
Out there meant for me
You're my star, yes, you are
You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny, ooh...

You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny

I caught a star, I caught a star
A star that's meant for me, ooh...
You're my star, yes, you are
You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny...
