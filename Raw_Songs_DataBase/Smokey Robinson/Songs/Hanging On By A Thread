We used to be tapestry
Now we're only hanging on by a thread
Tightly woven
Sewn together by the ties that bind
Joined together by a oneness of mind

Then it happened, something happened
And I know it's just not in my head

We used to be tapestry
Now we're only hanging on by a thread
Close-knit people
So close until not even light could shine through
Nothing could ever separate me from you

Then it happened, something happened
That started us to unravel and shred
Now we're only hanging on by a thread
By the thin line between go and stay
I can see a break up ahead

Oh, then it happened, something happened
That started us to unravel and shred
Now we're only hanging on by a thread
By the thin line between go and stay
I can see a break up ahead

We used to be tapestry
Now we're only hanging on by a thread
