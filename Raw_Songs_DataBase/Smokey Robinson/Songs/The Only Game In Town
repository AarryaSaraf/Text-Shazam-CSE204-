Yeah...

Lady Luck doesn't smile on everyone
You can bet your heart, she'll break it just for fun
Whenever the wheel spins, somebody's gotta lose, yeah
And I might be losin', but I can't walk away
Love's a gamble, but we all gotta play

It's the only game in town
Love is the only game around
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game

I can take my pick, but I always seem to choose
From the deck of hearts, marked for me to lose
Those are the chances we all gotta take, take
You can count up the heartbreaks, but you can't cash in
Just keep believin', soon you're gonna win

It's the only game in town
Love is the only game around
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game

There's no use cryin' about it, yeah
So, baby, what would life be without it

It's the only game in town, yeah
Love is the only game around
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game

Yeah

Yeah, there's no use cryin' about it
Oh, but, baby, what would life be without it
Without it

It's the only game in town, yeah
Love is the only game around, oh...
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game

It's the only game in town, yeah
Love is the only game around, oh...
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game

It's the only game in town
Love is the only game around
It's the only game in town
Love's the only game

It's the only
Yeah, it's the only
Oh... well
Love is the only game

It's the only game in town
Talkin' 'bout love, yeah
Love is the only game around
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game...
