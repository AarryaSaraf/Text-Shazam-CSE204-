You're not a cell, oh, no
But a prisoner am I
Caught in your spell, oh, yeah
The web and the fly
Prisoners usually only dream
Of one day bein' free
My dream is you lock me up
And throw away the key

Keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself
I say, keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself

You're not a cage, oh, no
But I am your inmate
Let's just engage in each other
Baby, I can't wait
A voluntary captive
All my time is spoken for
I could not escape you
Even through an open door

Keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself
(Keep me)
I say, keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself
(Keep me, keep me)

I'm guilty of love you
So make me serve
A lifetime of being with you
'Cause that's what I think I deserve
That's what I think I deserve

Ooh... baby...

Prisoners usually only dream
Of one day bein' free
My dream is you lock me up
And throw away the key
There's just no place
Nowhere else on earth I'd rather be

Oh, keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself
(Keep me, keep me)
I say, keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself, ooh...
(Keep me, keep me)

Keep me for yourself, ooh, yeah
(Keep me, keep me, keep me)
Keep me for your own
(Keep me, keep me, keep me)
Keep me locked away and love me good
Make me stay, then you'll never be alone
Keep me, keep me, keep me...
