Travelin' through life
I've been so many places
I've found treasures renown
In fantastic spaces
But the most spectacular sites
Ever to come into view
Are in the East, West, North
North and South of you

Travelin' through you
From your East and West
I find quaint invitations
To stop and take a rest
In mountains and valleys
As I go travelin' through
The East, West, North
North and South of you

In the North of you, I find
Jewels, oh, so rare
As I explore your mind
No thrills on earth were ever known
To match those found
In your torrid southern zone
You got a torrid southern zone
And I sure do like it, yes, baby
Yes, baby

Travelin' through you
Is a real living
A real reason to make
Every day a thanksgiving
To the divine creator
For having sent me through
The East, West, North
North and South of you

East, West, North
North and South of you
East, West, North
North and South of you
East, West, North
North and South of you
