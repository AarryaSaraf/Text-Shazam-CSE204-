When I look at you, what I do
Is touch you with my eyes
When love is real, I look and feel
Like a sweet caress, ooh-ooh, baby
Mentally, gently
I kiss you with my mind
And the bliss of a mental kiss
Makes us both aware that we always share

Feelings flowing from everywhere
Such a wonderful feeling flowing
With tender loving care

The feel of your hand seems to expand
The boundaries of touch, ooh...
It flows so deep, oh, honey, you keep
Getting better with time, oh, baby, yes, you do
Whenever you come into
Anyplace where I am
As soon as you arrive, my heart comes alive
It's a wonderful thing how you always bring

Feelings flowing from everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
(Such a wonderful feeling flowing)
An unspoken bond, it goes way beyond
Just a physical affair

Oh, my darling
Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby

You always bring me
Feelings flowing from everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
(Such a wonderful feeling flowing)
Yes, feelings flowing
Tender loving care

Oh, feelings flowing from everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
(Such a wonderful feeling flowing)
An unspoken bond, it goes way beyond
Just a physical affair
Oh, baby, oh, baby...
