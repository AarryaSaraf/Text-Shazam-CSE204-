Everyday I can't wait till the time rolls around where I can be with you

Whenever my day seem hard and totally wack
When I feel like I've put out and got nothin' back
I can't wait to get back to my sugar-shack
Where I know you'll lay me down

I can't wait for our time to roll around
Roll around, roll around, roll around

When I wanna go someplace cool that's really warm
When extraordinary lovin' is the norm
Where we create our own quiet storm
There's thunder and lighting when we get unwound

I can't wait for our time to roll around
Roll around, roll around, roll around
However I feel at end of day
However the world is treating me
However I know I'll be okay
'Cause you'll be there lying next to me
We're each other's ecstasy

Ooh, ah, ah

Maybe we'll take a walk for watch tv
Or maybe we'll just talk about you and me
Whatever we choose to do, we'll be totally free
Even if we go out, and paint the town

I can't wait for our time to roll around
Roll around, roll around, roll around
Roll around, roll around, roll around
