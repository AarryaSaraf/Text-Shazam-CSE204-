I will build you a castle with a tower so high
It reaches the moon
I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly
And compose you a tune
Give you lovin' warm as mama's oven
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new, yeah

I will take you away with me as far as I can
To Venus or Mars
There we will walk with your hand in my hand
You'll be queen of the stars
And everyday we can play on the Milky Way
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new

I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea
To wear in your hair
I'll do anything and everything to keep you happy
Girl, to show you that I care
I'll pretend I'm jealous of all the fellows
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new

I'll take the stars and count them and move a mountain
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new
Got a try something new

If at first I don't succeed
Try again, that's what I'll do
Always trying something else
Always trying something that's new
Got to try something new
Got to try something new
