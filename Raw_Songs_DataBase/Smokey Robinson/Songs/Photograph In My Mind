I've got this photograph in my mind
Photograph in my mind

You don't know it yet
But ever since we met
You've been the star of my dreams
Well, you've got that look of love
And I just can't get enough
Of what I'm seein' on the screen
So I picture me with you
Wanna make it all come true, baby

I've got this photograph in my mind
It's more beautiful every time
You look at me, it's no fantasy
I've got this photograph in my mind
It's developing all the time
Baby, you belong to me

That say what you visualize
Comes into your life
Well, I've got the vision clear
And I'm gonna let you know
How far I wanna go
The moment that I get you near
What I see will be
Hey, just you wait and see, baby

I've got this photograph in my mind
It's more beautiful every time
You look at me, it's no fantasy
I've got this photograph in my mind
It's developing all the time
Baby, you belong to me

You will see passion come to life
Just as soon as we expose it to the night

(I've got this photograph)

I've got this photograph in my mind
Photograph in my mind
I've got this photograph in my mind
Photograph in my mind

I've got this photograph in my mind
It's more beautiful every time
You look at me, it's no fantasy
I've got this photograph in my mind
It's developing all the time
Baby, you belong to me

I've got this photograph in my mind
It's more beautiful every time
You look at me, it's no fantasy
I've got this photograph in my mind
It's developing all the time
Baby, you belong to me...
