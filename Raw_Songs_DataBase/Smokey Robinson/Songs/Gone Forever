There ain't nothing like the love of a woman
Nothing feels so right than the love of a woman
And I am feeling down and blue

'Cause you're gone forever, gone forever
Gone forever, gone forever
Gone are the ways that we felt inside

Now I'm not saying that I want to be loved
By nobody but you, but, oh...
You see, I feel just like a fool
And you know that it's true

'Cause you're gone forever, gone forever
You're gone forever, gone forever
Gone are the ways that we felt inside

What I'd give, oh, yes, I'd give
For one more night
And I'm just a fool without you in my life
'Cause once where there was fire
Only lonely ashes blow in the wind
And it's hard dealing with the feeling
That I won't be loving you again
And I've lost my best friend

'Cause you're gone forever, gone forever
You're gone forever, gone forever
Gone are the ways that we felt inside

Oh, my love, oh, my love, goodbye
