Why did I have to see you again
I'm just getting you and me
It's too soon to be
Standing this close to you at a party
Laughing, pretending to be glad
Called a spade a spade
'Cause inside the joke
That you're telling
No one is laughing
Even you let me in on it
What's so funny?

You cannot laugh alone
That smile is not your own
Your love was crackerjack
A prize in every bag
A sugarcoated love
What dreams are made out of
A myth, a fantasy
A package C.O.D.
That no one will identify or pay for
A mystery left sitting on your front door

Throw it out of your mind
What you're thinking
Isn't worth wasting our time
What's the point in it?
Pretty eyes, softer tears
Strike a pose and push your hair
Back behind your ears
Sit up in your chair like a lady

You cannot laugh alone
That smile is not your own
Your love was crackerjack
It's a prize in every bag
A sugarcoated love
What dreams are made out of
A myth, a fantasy
A package C.O.D.

Your love was crackerjack
It's a prize
Your love was crackerjack
Your love was crackerjack
Oh, baby
'Cause your love was crackerjack
