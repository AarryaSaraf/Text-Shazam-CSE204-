The first time I laid eyes on you
I had an instant suspicion
To be with you would become
My life's ambition

I knew right away, form the very first day
That somewhere down the line
I'd wake up to see you lying right next to me
You'd be mine, all mine, all mine

You're the one for me, baby
Yeah, you're the one, baby
You're the one for me
Anyone can see, baby, yeah
You're the one, baby
You're the one for me

Opportunity comes knocking
In the form of somebody new
But I don't answer
'Cause the door to my heart is only open to you

Temptation around
Staring me down
Right in my face
But nobody could ever take your place
No one could fill your space

You're the one for me, baby
Yeah, you're the one, baby
You're the one for me
Anyone can see, baby, yeah
You're the one, baby
You're the one for me

Nobody could ever make feel good
Like you do
Nobody, but nobody, could ever thrill me so
I've got my mind made up about you
And I know, I know, it's you, it's you

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, you're the one
Oh yeah, you're the one, now
Anyone can see, baby
You're the one, baby
You're the one for me

Baby, you're the one
You're the one
You're the one
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yes, mm-mm
