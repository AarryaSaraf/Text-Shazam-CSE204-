You are a sweet addiction
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
And, girl, I've got strong convictions
I'll get to you in time

Some lovers play the fool
I'm gonna play it so cool
Plan every move that I make
I don't care what it takes
Ooh, 'cause I love you, baby

Some people will do anything for money
Work hard for every dime
And some people will do anything for love
And I'd do anything to make you mine

You are a star attraction
Honey, I know they all want you
(But that don't bother me 'cause)
I am a man of action
There's nothin' that I won't do

I'll call you night and day
Girl, I'm not going away
I'll sleep outside of your door
I'd do everything and more
Ooh, I won't give up

Some people will do anything for money
Work hard for every dime
And some people will do anything for love, girl
And I'd do anything to make you mine
Some people will do anything for money
Anything at anytime
And when it comes to you, I'm corrupted too, girl
'Cause I'd do anything to make you mine

Yeah

Some lovers play the fool
I'm gonna play it so cool
Plan every move that I make
I don't care what it takes
Ooh, 'cause I love you, baby

Some people will do anything for money
Anything at anytime
And when it comes to you, I'm corrupted too, girl
'Cause I'd do anything to make you mine

I'd do anything to make you mine...
Wanna make you mine
Wanna make you mine, oh...

Some people will do anything for love
I'd do anything for your love
Some people will do anything for love
You're the love I'm dreamin' of, yeah
Some people will do anything for love
Anything at anytime, so
Some people will do anything for love
I'd do anything to make you mine...
