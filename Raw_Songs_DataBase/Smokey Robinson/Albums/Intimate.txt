Album: Intimate

// Sleepin' In //

I got nowhere to go
Except closer to you, baby
You're like no one I know
I could spend days on in

Sleepin' in
I can feel the love, babe
Creepin' in
Like a butter on a biscuit
Seepin' in
Hot and sweet
What a tasty treat you are

I love holding you near
Feels so good to me, baby
If we never leave here
That's too soon for me
'Cause we could be

Sleepin' in
I can feel the love, babe
Creepin' in
Like a butter on a biscuit
Seepin' in
Hot and sweet
What a tasty treat you are

Sleepin' in
I can feel the love, babe
Creepin' in
The smell of your perfume
'Cause seepin' in
Drivin' me mad
You're the best I ever had now
You're the best I ever had now
You're the best I ever had now
You're the best I ever had now

Lay with me, babe
Lay with me stay with me
Stay with me lay with me

I love when I wake
To you touching me
Sweet and gentle
I've got so much at stake
You got my fantasies
You got my physical
You got my mental
Yes, you got my physical
You got my mental

Sleepin' in
I can feel the love, babe
Creepin' in
Like a butter on a biscuit
Seepin' in
Hot and sweet
What a tasty treat, ah...

Sleepin' in
I can feel your love, baby
Creepin' in
I can feel your love, babe
(All over me)
Sleepin' in
I can feel your love, babe
(I can feel your love, babe)
Stay with me lay with me
Lay with me stay with me
I can feel your love' babe

Lay with me stay with me
Stay with me lay with me
Sleep, sleep, sleepin' in

// Easy To Love //

Oh, my darling
Where are you tonight
Our situation wasn't really wrong
But it was not quite right
It hurts so much to say goodbye
Still I'm so glad we met
'Cause you're easy to love
Hard to forget

I really miss you
But then I knew I would
We had some rough edges that needed smoothing
But the good times were really good
Oh, we didn't make it this time
And that's my one regret
'Cause you're easy to love
Hard to forget
I say you're easy to love
Hard to forget

Oh, you won't release me
Release me, release me
I can't get over you
I'll always love you
You will be in my heart
No matter what you do
I keep saying it'll be better tomorrow
Tomorrow ain't come yet
You're easy to love
Hard to forget
I say easy to love
Hard to forget

You're easy, easy, easy to love
Gotta come back
Oh-oh, hard to forget
Easy to love, hard
Yes, baby, gotta come back
Yes, come back, come back, come back
Gotta come back
Easy to love, yes, baby...

// Love Love Again //

Baby, yeah, yeah

I want to love you, teach me how
Just open you heart to me somehow
Somehow, right now, right now
'Cause I want to show you
What a real love's like
Whatever was wrong, I'll make it right
I will, I will, I will
And, darling, don't be afraid
Of the feelings you keep deep inside

I'll make you love love again
Yes, I will, yes, I will
Show you that we'll never end
Never, no, never, never
Swear I can dry every tear you cry
I'll make you love love
Gonna love love again, again

I'll always want you, you know I will
And I'll keep your heart from standing still
I will, I will, yes
And, baby, I'll make you see
You're a woman who wants to be loved by me

I'll make you love love again
Show you that we'll never end
Never, never end
Swear I can dry every tear you cry
(I swear, every tear you cry)
I'll make you love love again

And all night, I'll take it slow
'Til we find a place that we both want to go
And, baby, I'll never stop
'Til you can feel this love filling up your heart

I'll make you love love again
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Show, show you that we'll never end
I will show you, show you, show you
Swear I can dry every tear you cry
(Ooh, every tear you cry)
I'll make you love love, love again

I'll make you love love again
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me
You're gonna love love again
Come on, love me, love me, love me, love, me, love me...

// Intimate //

Let's be intimate

I can't tell you
How much mental time you take up
Oh, why, every morning when I wake up
You are the first and the last
On my list of things I must do
There's not a night that's goes past
I don't dream of being with just you

Think about it, ooh...
Baby, think about it, yes

Secret you're longing, ah...
Sweet inhibition
Ooh, each of us waiting
Just to get the other's permission

To be intimate, come here, baby
Let me hold you in my arms
Intimate, let me love you
Keep you safe, keep you warm
Every night, every night
Truly, truly, let me and you be
Intimate, ooh, yeah

Oh, baby

Intimate with you, baby
All the time, every day
Intimate, that's the feeling
In my body, that's the way
Every night, every night
Truly, truly, let me and you be
Intimate, intimate, ooh, baby

Baby, yeah, baby, yeah
Intimate, baby, yeah, yeah, oh...
Closer, closer, closer

// I'm The One //

You were trapped in a room of doubt
You had no way out
You were fighting to make it work
But you lost that bout
You fell in my arms all brokenhearted
Making me feel our time has started
I know, you never thought that I'd come thru
I did what anybody else, somebody would do

I'm the one who pulled you from the fire, yeah
I'm the one who saved you from the fall, oh...
I'm the one who risked his heart to be your all and all
Remember, I'm the one who came to the rescue, oh...

You were drowning your life away
In a sea of tears
Always searching for happiness
In the eyes of your peers
So I threw out my heart like a cowboy rope
You told me that I was your one last hope
I know, you think I'm just a fantasy
But please don't forget about me, baby

I'm the one who pulled you from the fire, oh, yeah
I'm the one who saved you from the fall, uh-huh
I'm the one who risked his heart to be your all and all
Remember, I'm the one who came to the rescue

You let your heart be left
Way out there on a limb
You never thought I'd be your hero
A hero I am not
But I gave you all the love I've got
So if the choice is him or me
Think about it carefully

I'm the one, girl, I pulled you from the fire
I'm the one, yes, saved you from the fall
I'm the one who risked his heart to be your all and all
Remember, I'm the one who came to the rescue

I'm the one who pulled you from the fire, yes
I'm the one who saved you from the fall, saved you
I'm the one who risked his heart to be your all and all
(Let me be good)
Remember, I'm the one who came to the rescue

// Just Let Me Love You //

Just let me love you
Like nobody's loved you
Make you my queen
Make your heart sing
Over and over again

You've given up on true love
You say love's too unstable, yeah
You've seen the worst in mankind
But don't give me that label

I see the treasure in you
But your heart turned to stone
Give me the chance and you'll see
A world you never been shown

Girl, I know how it feels to let somebody in
Going through heartbreak again and again
But this time the hurting has come to an end
I'll keep love burning bright
Every day, every night

Just let me love you
Like nobody's loved you
Make you my queen
Make your heart sing
Over and over again

I don't expect you to trust
Take all the time you need
I've waited my whole life for you
I will follow your lead

If you'll just let me do all the things I can do
Nothing in life is more special than you
My darling, I promise this man will come through
I've got something to live for
To die for, to cry for

Just let me love you
Like nobody's loved you
Make you my queen
Make your heart sing
Over and over again

Now there are no guarantees in love
But if you just give me a chance
I can guarantee that I'll do my best
To make it the best it's ever been
For you, my love

If you'll just let me do all the things I can do
Nothing in life is more special than you
My darling, I promise this man will come through
I've got something to live for
To die for, to cry, cry, cry
(Cry for, cry for)

Just let me love you
Like nobody's loved you
You're a queen
I wanna make your heart sing
Over and over and over

Love you, love you
(Just let me love you)
Like nobody
(Like nobody's loved you)
Make you my queen
Make your heart sing
Over and over again, again...

// All Of Mine //

Lady, lady, lady
I've been waiting on the sideline
I'd be willing to wait another lifetime
If you promise one day you will be mine

We've been living in my imagination
And way beyond my wildest dreams
If we get together, that'll be the day
When you're more what I feel
You'll see what I mean

Gonna be a passion thing, hotter than an oven
Gonna be totally another kind of lovin'
Gonna be wildfire when our bodies entwine
I don't know if I'll love you all of your life
But I know I'll love you all of mine

Oh, lady, lady, lady
I believe you're my destiny
You've got my mind all slowed up
And when you take the rest of me

Gonna be an intimate way to celebrate
Gonna be a soulful thing 'cause you're my soul mate
Gonna be physical and mental and everything combined
I don't know if I'll love you all of your life
But I know I'll love you all of mine

Yeah, yes, ooh...
Baby, whoo, baby, oh...
I know I'll love you all
Know I'll love you
Know I'll love you all of mine, ooh...

Gonna be a passion thing, hotter than an oven, yes
Gonna be totally another kind of lovin'
(Ooh, another kind)
Gonna be the wild thing when our bodies entwine
I don't know if I'll love you all of your life
But I know I'll love you all of mine

Gonna be an intimate way to celebrate, yeah
Gonna be a soulful thing 'cause you're my soul mate
Gonna be physical and mental, everything combined
I don't know if I'll love you all of your life
But I know I'll love you all of mine...

// The Bottom Line //

Bought a pound of writing paper
It's balled up and scattered all around my place
I've been trying to write and say what
I found it hard to tell you face to face

I tried to get real deep and poetic
Put on a little word show
I borrowed from playwrights and poets and songwriters
But I'll just simply say what I want you to know

I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
I could write every day and all night
But that's the bottom line, well, well

I think a million thought of many
About you and believe me and never fails
To be way too many to mention
But there's one thought that always prevails

I love you so much
I, I love you so much
I love you so much, so much, so much
I love you so much
If I said all the things in my head
That's the bottom line

Why do I do
Things that make me seem so unconfident
A phrase in love has no need to be fancy
It just needs to be truly meant, truly meant
Truly, truly, truly

I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much, so much, so much
I love you so much
I could preach or say a ten-day speech
If I write every day and all night
If I said all the things in my head
No matter what I do, I just love you
That's the bottom line

I love you so much
Baby, I love you so much, so much, so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
I could write every day and all night
But that's the bottom line

I love you so much, so much, so much
Love you, love you, love you, love you
I love you so much...

// Feelings Flowing //

When I look at you, what I do
Is touch you with my eyes
When love is real, I look and feel
Like a sweet caress, ooh-ooh, baby
Mentally, gently
I kiss you with my mind
And the bliss of a mental kiss
Makes us both aware that we always share

Feelings flowing from everywhere
Such a wonderful feeling flowing
With tender loving care

The feel of your hand seems to expand
The boundaries of touch, ooh...
It flows so deep, oh, honey, you keep
Getting better with time, oh, baby, yes, you do
Whenever you come into
Anyplace where I am
As soon as you arrive, my heart comes alive
It's a wonderful thing how you always bring

Feelings flowing from everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
(Such a wonderful feeling flowing)
An unspoken bond, it goes way beyond
Just a physical affair

Oh, my darling
Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby

You always bring me
Feelings flowing from everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
(Such a wonderful feeling flowing)
Yes, feelings flowing
Tender loving care

Oh, feelings flowing from everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
(Such a wonderful feeling flowing)
An unspoken bond, it goes way beyond
Just a physical affair
Oh, baby, oh, baby...

// Ready To Roll //

Come on...
Yeah, yeah...

I'm ready to roll, roll, roll, roll
Ready to roll, my love is for real
I'm ready to roll, roll, roll, roll

Yesterday, I had a vision, baby, yeah
A vision of you and me together, Lord, have mercy
We were wrapped in a sweet, sweet love, yeah
Soaked in rain from the skies above

Now I don't wanna rush you, baby, but I can't ignore
These feelings are growing for you, baby, more and more
I want you bad, baby, I can see it so clear
(I want you so bad, so bad)
If you feel what I feel, then here is the deal
I'll let you steer

I'm ready to roll with you, baby, ooh...
I'm ready to ride, baby, all night long
I'm ready to cruise with you, baby, come on
Girl, are you comin', my motor's runnin'
Waiting for you

I'm ready to roll with you, baby, ooh...
(I'm ready to roll, roll, roll with you, mama)
I'm ready to ride, baby, all night long
I'm ready to cruise with you, baby, come on, hey
Girl, are you comin' with me, my motor's runnin'
I'm waiting for you

I would never disrespect you, my lady, no
Girl, I promise to be honest, and I will, baby
I've been waiting for quite some time
Baby, I need you, I really need you to make up your mind

Ooh, baby, please, don't make me get down on my knees
Ooh, please, don't make me beg, ooh, baby
(I beg you, babe)
The way you move around me drives me wild
I get turned on by your simple smile

I don't wanna rush you, baby, but I can't ignore
These feelings are growing stronger for you more and more
I want you bad, bad, bad, baby, right now, right here
(I want you so bad, so bad)
If you feel what I feel, here is the deal
I'll let you steer

I'm ready to roll with you, baby, ooh...
(Roll, roll)
I'm ready to ride, baby, all night long
(Yes, all night)
I'm ready to cruise with you, baby, come on, come on
Girl, are you comin', my motor's runnin'
Oh, I'm waiting for you...

// Tú Me Besas Muy Rico //

Lover you are in my eyes
The most exciting
It comes to me, no surprise
You are igniting
The fire it burns in my veins
You touch me and I go insane

Tú me besas muy rico
Tú me besas muy rico
Tú me besas muy rico

A sexy and sensual one
You will forever be, forever
Let me love you 'til I'm done
Which I will never, never be
You make my body do things
Wild and wonderful new things
Oh, whoa

Tú me besas muy rico, ah
Tú me besas muy rico, rico
Tú me besas muy rico

Tu mira de besar
Me transportas el lugar
Donde hago lo que quieras tú
A pensar en tus caricias
Solo imagino
Ay, ya ya ya, así
Sí, sí, ooh

Your lips are so moist like morning dew
I have no choice
I get off on you
Ooh whoa

Tú me besas muy rico
Tú me besas muy rico, so good
Tú me besas muy rico
Muy rico, muy rico
Tú me besas muy rico, so good
You kiss me so good, ah

Tú me besas muy rico
