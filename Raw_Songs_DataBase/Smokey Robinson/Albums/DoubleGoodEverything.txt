// Why //

Why, why, why, why

That old river needed crossing
Those dice needed tossing
It probably ended up costing
Somebody something just to do
And I think you need to be loved by me, that's why
Oh, I think you need to be loved by me
That's why, why, why
Oh, baby, that's why, why, why
I'm willing to pay the price just for loving you

That old wall needed scaling
That sea needed sailing
Somebody took a chance on failing
Just to prove it could be done
And I think you need to be loved by me, that's why
Oh, baby, I think you need to be loved by me
That's why, why, why
Oh, baby, that's why, why, why
I'm chancing loving you 'cause you're the one

Ah, baby

Well, we all have our own reasons
Why we do the things we do
Something that makes it
Real important to you

Why, why

That old mountain needed climbing
Some inner need is why men
Have to put some time in
If you wanna make a dream come true
And I gotta inner need to be loved by you, that's why
Oh, mama, gotta inner need to be loved by you
That's why, why, why
Oh, baby, that's why, why, why
I'm puttin' in my time to try to make you love me too
Ah, baby

Why, why

I gotta inner need to be loved by you, that's why
I think you need to be loved by me, that's why
Oh, I gotta inner need to be loved by you, that's why
I think you need to be loved by me, that's why

Why, why, mama, mama, that's why, why, why, why, why
I gotta inner need to be loved by you, that's why
I think you need to be loved by me, that's why
Oh, baby, that's why, mama, mama, that's why...

// Double Good Everything //

It's paradise, paradise
It's ecstasy, ecstasy
It's awful nice, awful nice
Having you loving me
It's wonderful, wonderful
It's very true, very true
It's double good everything
Being loved by you

But what did I do to deserve this
Makes me stop and wonder who am I?
What would make you want to serve this
To just another ordinary guy
Twice as good as any feeling
I have ever known
To call my own

I said, it's paradise, paradise
Well, you know it's ecstasy, ecstasy
It's awful nice, awful nice
Baby, having you loving me
You know that it's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, very true, very true
It's double good everything
Being loved by you

You got an over abundant
Amount of everything I seem to need
You gotta know you're the one
When I just have to follow where you lead
Keep that loving coming to me
Don't let up one bit
Don't ever quit

Because it's paradise, paradise
Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy
It's awful nice, awful nice
Baby, having you loving me
Oh, you know it's wonderful, wonderful
Yeah, very true, very true
It's double good everything
Being loved by you

Well, being loved by you
Being loved by you
Oh, being loved by you
Being loved by you
Being loved by you
Oh, being loved by you
It's double good, double good
(Being loved by you)
Double good, double good
Double good, double good
(Being loved by you)
Double good, being loved by you
Being loved by you
Ah, it's wonderful, wonderful
(Being loved by you)
Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy...

// Rewind //

Kisses sweet as marmalade
Two lovers who had it made
Not a dark cloud in sight
Everything seemed so right

Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time

A small apartment two could share
Overdone cooking nobody cares
Tastes like caviar
Because of where we are

Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Well, well, well
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time

Where are you now and where am I
Said that you would never say goodbye

Take me back to yesterday
Yester feeling yester way
Holding someone tight
Morning, moon and night

Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Rewind, rewind
Rewind, I wanna go back to that time
Take me back there now
...

// Be Who You Are //

Just be yourself, you know that actually
Put-ons are turn-offs and you are so naturally
Sexy without a try, it's unintentional
Naturally flowing and making you sensual
Don't change, baby, don't change
Trust me, just be you

To me, you be who you are
That's good enough for me
To me, you see you're the way
I want my woman to be

Something you've got seems to be making me
More and more into you
Your unmistakably just what I want for me
Nobody's perfect, so we have our ups and downs
But you make it worth it so
Don't change, baby, don't change
Trust me, just be you

To me, you be who you are
That's good enough for me
To me, you see you're the starlight
In my galaxy

Don't change, baby, don't change
Trust me, just be you
Well, well

To me, you be who you are
That's good enough for me
Well, well
To me, you see you're the way
I want my woman to be
I want my woman to be
I want my woman to be

I want my woman to be
Said, I want my woman to be
I want my woman to be
Just the way you are
I want my woman to be
Just the way you are
Don't change, baby
Baby, don't change
I want my woman to be
Just the way you are...

// I Love Your Face //

I love your face
I love the way you smile at me
An open door that let's the sunshine in
It lights my world, my day begins

I love your face
I love the look that's in your eyes
You see right through the deepest part of me
Right down into the heart of me
I love your face

Don't you ever change
You're just right for me
I love all of you and especially

I love your face
I love the message there for me
The greatest love story I ever heard
Without a sound, without a word
I love your face
I love your face
I love your face

// I Can't Get Enough //

Baby love, I can't get enough now
Don't you know you're making it tough, now
For anybody else and me
I get the feeling deep down inside me
If your love was ever denied me
Alone is what I would be

You're so good, you're so fine
You're like my beauty queen
My mama and baby combined
I love your ways
You're got personality and charisma for days

Go on and strut your stuff, baby
I can't get enough, baby
Mister Catch has met his match

Baby love, I can't get enough now
Don't you know you're making it tough now
For anybody else and me
I get the feeling deep down inside me
If your love was ever denied me
Alone is what I would be

You plant a seed
And now the more I have of you
The more that I need
Can't help how I care
I don't want to be greedy
But I don't wanna share

Go on and strut your stuff, baby
I can't get enough, baby
Mister Catch has met his match

Blow it, blow it, blow it...

You rang my bell
Ding dong, now I've got a story to tell
So loud and clear
I've got to do my best to keep you here

Go on and strut your stuff, baby
I can't get enough, baby
Mister Catch has met his match

Baby love, I can't get enough now
Don't you know you're making it tough now
For anybody else and me
I, I get the feeling deep down inside me
If your love was ever denied me
Alone is what I would be, oh...

Baby love, I can't get enough now
Don't you know you're making it tough now
For anybody else and me
I get the feeling deep down inside me
If your love was ever denied me
Alone is what I would be
Well, well, well, well

Baby love, I can't get enough now
Don't you know you're making it tough now
For anybody else and me
I get the feeling deep down inside me
If your love was ever denied me
Alone is what I would be

// Rack Me Back //

They called me Good Time Charlie
That's who I was 'til you came along
Now all the girls and guys are so surprised
'Cause Good Time Charlie is gone
There's been a major change somehow
My friends don't even recognize me now

Rack me back, shake me up, work me over
Well, well
Rack me back, shake me up, work me over

Now I was no Casanova
But you can believe I've had my share
Until your love took me over
Now nobody else can even compare
Well, you're teaching me what love is about
Your love is wiping everybody out

Rack me back, oh, baby, shake me up, work me over
Oh, rack me back, shake me up, work me over
Well, well, well, well, well

Now I was my own person
And I answered to nobody but me, oh...
I was partying hardy
Foot loose and fancy free
I don't know how you do what you do
But I can't wait to have it being done by you

Rack me back, shake me up, work me over, oh, baby
Rack me back, shake me up, work me over
Oh, baby, baby, now
Rack me back, shake me up, work me over
Ooh, rack me back, shake me up, work me over...

// When A Woman Cries //

When a woman cries, when a woman cries
She can wash your world away
When storms fill her eyes, when storms fill her eyes
You never know just what to say
Don't say a word, don't say anything
She don't need your truth or lies
Just hold her close and love her
When a woman cries

When a woman cries, when a woman cries
There's just no sadder song
So you apologize, you apologize
Even if you don't know what you did wrong
And if you really want to make her happy
To stop her sobbing and her sighs
Just hold her close and love her
When a woman cries

Now don't you waste your time thinkin'
About the right thing to say
Just put your arms around her
'Tile the clouds roll away

When a woman cries, when she cries
She can tear your world apart
When storms fill her eyes
They can break a man's heart
And if you find that you are cryin' too
Don't let it came as no surprise
Hold her close, hold her close and love her
When your woman cries

// You Take Me Away //

Wild love, wild love
Where're we going tonight
What's our fantasy flight gonna be
Fly me right past the moon
Through the galaxy soar
Being with you somewhere
Is all that I'm living for

You take me away
You take me away
You take me away
You take me away

Sweet love, sweet love
What's our destination
Soon to be location gonna be
Some sweet moment in time
Will stand still and we'll be
Lost in each other's arms
Please don't stop loving me

You take me away
You take me away
You take me away
You take me away, baby

Stationary journey
We leave and yet never go
Just one touch and I'm gone
Don't you know, don't you know

You take me away
You take me away, baby
You take me away
You take me away, baby

Take me, take me away
You take me, take me away, baby
Take me away, baby
Take me away
Take me, oh, take me
Ooh, baby, take me
You take me away...

// Skid Row //

Clerks at the hotels don't take a chance
Rooms for three dollars pay in advance
Sleep on a mattress, you might get a sheet
But you'd be surprised at the people you meet
Telling their tales of trouble and woe
'Bout how they got down here to skid row

Minnie the moocher begging for dimes
Her life has fallen on difficult times
She was a teacher, got strung out on crack
Went out so far 'til she never got back
When she started teaching, she didn't know
'Bout the school of hard knocks down on skid row

Willie the wino, now ain't it a shame
Sleeping in doorways, he don't know his name
Was a surgical doctor, the top of his class
'Til he started finding his nerve in a glass
A little nip now and then began to grow and grow
He's a missing physician on skid row

Skid row, anywhere USA
You can find them there
Lost sheep who have gone astray
We gotta lift them up in prayer

Larry and Lisa, three kids and all
Nowhere to go and no one to call
Larry was working, he was laid off
Lived in a house that wasn't paid off
Went into foreclosure and they had to go
Now they live on the streets down on skid row

Well, well, skid row, anywhere USA
You can find them there
The numbers growing higher everyday
We gotta show them somebody cares
Well, skid row, anywhere USA
You can find them there
Lost sheep who have gone astray
We gotta lift them up in prayer...
