// Some People (Will Do Anything For Love) //

You are a sweet addiction
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
And, girl, I've got strong convictions
I'll get to you in time

Some lovers play the fool
I'm gonna play it so cool
Plan every move that I make
I don't care what it takes
Ooh, 'cause I love you, baby

Some people will do anything for money
Work hard for every dime
And some people will do anything for love
And I'd do anything to make you mine

You are a star attraction
Honey, I know they all want you
(But that don't bother me 'cause)
I am a man of action
There's nothin' that I won't do

I'll call you night and day
Girl, I'm not going away
I'll sleep outside of your door
I'd do everything and more
Ooh, I won't give up

Some people will do anything for money
Work hard for every dime
And some people will do anything for love, girl
And I'd do anything to make you mine
Some people will do anything for money
Anything at anytime
And when it comes to you, I'm corrupted too, girl
'Cause I'd do anything to make you mine

Yeah

Some lovers play the fool
I'm gonna play it so cool
Plan every move that I make
I don't care what it takes
Ooh, 'cause I love you, baby

Some people will do anything for money
Anything at anytime
And when it comes to you, I'm corrupted too, girl
'Cause I'd do anything to make you mine

I'd do anything to make you mine...
Wanna make you mine
Wanna make you mine, oh...

Some people will do anything for love
I'd do anything for your love
Some people will do anything for love
You're the love I'm dreamin' of, yeah
Some people will do anything for love
Anything at anytime, so
Some people will do anything for love
I'd do anything to make you mine...

// Sleepless Nights //

Come here, baby
Lay down beside me, now, yeah
No time for maybe
Show me like only you know how
You are so sweetly completely
In touch with my fantasy
With everything that you do

Sleepless nights when you're with me, ooh, babe
Feels so right, feels so right, the way it should be
Sleepless nights

Come here, baby
We don't need the light anymore
No time, no time for maybe
Show me what the night is really for
When I'm holding you
Life is unfolding inside of me, ooh...
Whenever I reach for you

Sleepless nights, sleepless, sleepless nights
(Together again)
Together, together
Feels so right, feels so right
(Don't let it end)
Don't you ever let it end
Sleepless nights, when I'm with you
Never so right, but ever so true

Hold me, hold me
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee, oh, baby

Sleepless nights, sleepless, sleepless nights
When you're with me
Feels so right, feel so right
(The way is should be)
Just the way it always will

Ooh, sleepless nights, sleepless nights
(Together again)
Together forever and ever
(Feels so right)
To make things just right as they can be
It just takes the night in you and me
(Don't let it end)
Being together

Sleepless night, sleepless nights
When you're with me...

// Because Of You (It's The Best It's Ever Been) //

Now I'm not a stranger to feeling good
Neither devil nor angel am I
I may not have loved as many as I could
But you're one of the ones I just had to try

You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
That's the best it's ever been

Ooh-wee, baby

The number one song's on the radio
I've heard it a thousand times or more
Why it sounds better, I don't really know
But it's never sounded quite this good before

Before we touched, before we kissed
It never sounded quite like this
One more time, play it again
That's the best it's ever been
You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
That's the best it's ever been

The whole world seems brand new
I feel like I do, because of you
Because of you, because of you

So strange
But just because of you
Everything I do
It's just like I've never
(Never, never, never)
I've changed
I'm like a brand new me
All feelings seem to be
Better than ever
Better than ever

The whole world seems brand new, whole world
I feel like I do, because of you
Because of you, because of you

You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
That's the best it's ever been
You touched me once, you touched me twice
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
That's the best it's ever been

You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
(One more, do it)
That's the best it's ever been
You loved me once, you loved me twice
(Never been better)
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
(One more, do it)
That's the best it's ever been

You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
(Kiss me, kiss me)
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
(Oh, babe)
That's the best it's ever been
You loved me once, you loved me twice
(Love me, oh, yeah)
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
(One more, do it)
That's the best it's ever been...

// Be Kind To The Growing Mind //

Watch what you say
You gotta speak with a little more discipline
Our little brothers and sisters are listening
There's a subtler way
That you can say any idea you want to express
You can tell them of love without every detail
And let life and time do the rest
Some don't know the meaning of everything you say
But they repeat you anyway

So you've gotta be kind to the growing mind
Said you gotta be kind to the growing mind

Watch what you do
Think of the future, people, you may be creating
Our little brothers and sisters are imitating
You're a who's who, they wanna be like you
So set a positive example
Life is a pie you don't eat all at once
Every now and then you taste another sample
Soon enough, they start to find out
What it's all about

So we gotta be kind to the growing mind
Said we gotta be kind to the growing mind

Think about it, everybody

Watch what you say
You gotta watch what you say and what you do
Our little brothers and sisters look up to you
Now you can be sexy, it's alright especially
When it's done at the right time and place
Try to remember that a young mind
Is a terrible thing to waste
Let us remember it's up to you and me
It's our responsibility

Yeah, we gotta be kind to the growing mind
You're little brothers and sister need you to be
We gotta be kind to the growing mind
You and me, gotta be
We gotta be kind to the growing mind
Temptations, tell them, oh, yeah
We gotta be kind to the growing mind
Oh, we gotta be kind to the growing mind
You and me, gotta be, kind, kind, kind
We gotta be kind to the growing mind...

// Te Quiero Como Si No Hubiera Un Mañana (I'm Gonna Love You Like There's No Tomorrow) //

Si, si, mi amor, besame por favor
So much about you I just can't ignore
Mi amor es para ti, pero tu amor a mi
Only makes me love you more and more
Que peso a mi corazón
Because of you, no more am I alone

Te quiero como si no hubiera un mañana
Te quiero como si no hubiera un mañana
Tonight would be the perfect time
So if you let me, darling
I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow

Si, si, querida, tu eres mi vida
I want you more so, mi linda señorita
Nueva sensaciones y vibraciones
Make me realize your love is sweeter
You look at me with that say "si, si"
Promising just how good tonight will be

Te quiero como si no hubiera un mañana
Te quiero como si no hubiera un mañana
Tonight would be the perfect time
So if you let me, darling
I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow

Esta noche, esta noche
It's only you and me
Besa me, besa me mucho
That would make tonight the best
That any night could ever be

Tu llegases a mi corazón
Because of you, no more am I alone

Te quiero como si no hubiera un mañana
Te quiero como si no hubiera un mañana
Tonight would be the perfect time
So if you let me, darling
I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow

Te quiero como si no hubiera un mañana

Te quiero como si no hubiera un mañana
Te quiero como si no hubiera un mañana
Tonight would be the perfect time
So if you let me, darling
I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow...

// Hold On To Your Love //

Hold on, hold on

Hold on to your love as tight as you can
Love your lover just as right as you can
When the road gets rough and goin' gets tough
Hold on to your love as tight as you can

I had a woman who loved me truly
She took her heart and soul and gave them to me
But so for granted, I took her love
Till she decided she'd had enough
And then one morning when I woke up
There I was alone
That's how I know to tell you

Hold on to your love as tight as you can
Love your lover just as right as you can
When the road gets rough and goin' gets tough
Hold on to your love as tight as you can

Hold on to your love with all of your might
You can never hold your lover too tight
You can lose so much when love loses touch
Hold on to your love as tight as you can

Hold on, ooh, hold on
Hold on, lovers hold on

In love's beginning, we can't see it ending
We're too caught up in the happy hours we're spending
But if you don't keep wood on the fire
To keep the flames of love growing higher
Your lover still may burn with desire
But only to leave
That's why I'm tell you to

Hold on to your love as tight as you can
Love your lover just as right as you can
When the road gets rough and goin' gets tough
Hold on to your love as tight as you can

Hold on to your love with all of your might
You can never hold your lover too tight
You can lose so much when love loses touch
So hold on to your love as tight as you can

Hold on to your lover tight as you can
You'll find that true love's in the bush
And not worth one in the hand
Hold on, you better
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, lovers hold on
Break it on down now, fellas

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Lovers hold on
Hold on to your lover
Hold on, hold on

Now I want somebody to tell me
What should you do if you really love your lover?

Hold on
Tell me, tell me, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Lover hold on...

// Photograph In My Mind //

I've got this photograph in my mind
Photograph in my mind

You don't know it yet
But ever since we met
You've been the star of my dreams
Well, you've got that look of love
And I just can't get enough
Of what I'm seein' on the screen
So I picture me with you
Wanna make it all come true, baby

I've got this photograph in my mind
It's more beautiful every time
You look at me, it's no fantasy
I've got this photograph in my mind
It's developing all the time
Baby, you belong to me

That say what you visualize
Comes into your life
Well, I've got the vision clear
And I'm gonna let you know
How far I wanna go
The moment that I get you near
What I see will be
Hey, just you wait and see, baby

I've got this photograph in my mind
It's more beautiful every time
You look at me, it's no fantasy
I've got this photograph in my mind
It's developing all the time
Baby, you belong to me

You will see passion come to life
Just as soon as we expose it to the night

(I've got this photograph)

I've got this photograph in my mind
Photograph in my mind
I've got this photograph in my mind
Photograph in my mind

I've got this photograph in my mind
It's more beautiful every time
You look at me, it's no fantasy
I've got this photograph in my mind
It's developing all the time
Baby, you belong to me

I've got this photograph in my mind
It's more beautiful every time
You look at me, it's no fantasy
I've got this photograph in my mind
It's developing all the time
Baby, you belong to me...

// No Time To Stop Believing //

It's no time to stop believing
It's no time to be unsure
Don't go change your mind about us
There's no need to feel insecure

Don't go thinking it's all over
'Cause you know that it's not true
It's no time to stop believing
I'm still in love with you
(Don't stop believing)
I'm still in love with you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't stop believing)

It's a phase we're going through
It will pass and you will see
We'll look back and laugh
I've got faith on you
(Don't stop believing)
So have some faith in me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't stop believing)

It's no time to stop believing
It's no time to be unsure
Don't go change your mind about us
There's no need to feel insecure

It's so hard to get somewhere
And I try too hard, I know
But I'm doing it for us
And if you're not with me, girl
(Don't stop believing)
I don't wanna go
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't stop believing)
I don't wanna go

It's no time to stop believing
There's no need for any doubt
Don't you even think of leaving
I don't want the flame to go out
(Don't stop, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't stop)

It's a phase we're going through
It will pass and you will see
We'll look back and laugh
I've got faith on you
(Don't stop believing)
So have some faith in me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't stop believing)

It's no time to stop believing, don't stop
Don't be unsure
Don't you change your mind about us
There's no need to feel insecure

// Wishful Thinking //

The night's electric
When I'm dancin' close to you
It's just like magic
A feeling too good to be true
And when I kiss you
Girl, it feels so wonderful
You say you love me
It's like some kind of miracle

Then I realize
I'm just a victim of imagination

It's only wishful thinkin'
Just a fantasy, a sweet illusion
It's only wishful thinkin'
And though you don't love me
I can't help dreamin'

You're my obsession
But you don't even know I'm there
I'm lost inside this
Imaginary love affair, hey
Guess I should give up
But then again you never know
So I keep dreamin'
About you when I should let go

It feels so real
When I'm caught up in this fascination

It's only wishful thinkin'
Just a fantasy, a sweet illusion
It's only wishful thinkin', baby
And though you don't love me
I can't help dreamin'
It's only wishful thinkin'
(Only wishful)
Just a fantasy, you love me too, girl
It's only wishful thinkin', alright
Wishin' you loved me is all I do, girl

Hey, then I realize
I'm just a victim of imagination

It's only wishful thinkin'
Just a fantasy, a sweet illusion
It's only wishful thinkin', baby
And though you don't love me
I can't help dreamin', oh, yeah
It's only wishful thinkin', baby
Just a fantasy, you love me too, girl
It's only wishful thinkin'
Wishin' you loved me is all I do, girl...

// Hanging On By A Thread //

We used to be tapestry
Now we're only hanging on by a thread
Tightly woven
Sewn together by the ties that bind
Joined together by a oneness of mind

Then it happened, something happened
And I know it's just not in my head

We used to be tapestry
Now we're only hanging on by a thread
Close-knit people
So close until not even light could shine through
Nothing could ever separate me from you

Then it happened, something happened
That started us to unravel and shred
Now we're only hanging on by a thread
By the thin line between go and stay
I can see a break up ahead

Oh, then it happened, something happened
That started us to unravel and shred
Now we're only hanging on by a thread
By the thin line between go and stay
I can see a break up ahead

We used to be tapestry
Now we're only hanging on by a thread
