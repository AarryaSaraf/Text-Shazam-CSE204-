Album: LoveSmokey

// I Can't Find //

Every now and then
Somebody comes into my life
Oh, and for a little while, it seems
They're the answer to my dreams, to my prayer
As sudden as they come, they start to fade
Like floating smoke rings
Oh, how can they stay with me when
They're only penciled in, you're always there
So I say, oh, my love
If you can find it in your heart
To do just one thing for me
Come back, come back, come back, come back

I don't want to look when I know where
Just what I need is
Oh, honey, you've got it with you
So what else can I do
But come to you, my love
And say take me in your arms
Hold me close, I need to feel you
Oh, to me, there's nothing like your touch
It's what I need so much
Oh, yes, I do, my love
So if you feel the need
To ever be with me again
Don't let another moment pass
Come back, come back, come back, come back

I can't find my way
To our very special somewhere
I can't find myself
'Cause without you, I'm just out there
I can't find that person
I want to put that much in
I can't find anybody like you
Who makes touching more than touching

I've been looking
There's just nobody around, ooh...
No sense looking
For who can never be found

So if you feel the need
To ever be with me again
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Come back, come back, come back, come back

I can't find sleep at night
I'm either watching TV or walking
I can't find any conversation
That means more to me than talking
I can't find satisfaction
Even when I do surrender
I can't find anybody like you
Who makes tender more than tender

I've been looking
There's just nobody around, ooh...
No sense looking
For who can never be found

I can't find anybody like you
Who gets my full attention
I can't find anybody who means
Enough for me to mention
I can't find that person
I want to put that much in
I can't find anybody like you...
