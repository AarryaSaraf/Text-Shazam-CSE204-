// Why You Wanna See My Bad Side //

Why you want to see my bad side
Baby, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
Oh, yeah, it's true, you do
Why don't you just let me love you
The way I want to
I just want to kiss and hug you
Oh, yeah, it's true, I do
Can't you see, it's you and me
Not them, not those, not they
But it's you and me, baby, yeah

You want to see my bad side
Just fussin' over nothin' and gettin' mad, well
Verbal stones hurt my love bones
Got me doin' things against my nature, yeah
Sometimes I think I overrate you

Child, honey, honey child
I just want to treat you right now, baby, yeah
Treat you good, you know I could if you let me, well

Well, well, baby, oh...

I know with love comes from problems
But jumpin' up and down just ain't gonna solve 'em, no, no
Sometimes I want to leave you alone, baby
I don't dig no sadomasochism, no
It just throws my life all out of rhythm

Oh, child, honey, honey child, yeah
I just want to treat you right now, baby, baby
Treat you good, you know I could if you let me

Why you want to see my bad side
Baby, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
Oh, yeah, it's true, you do
Why don't you just let me love you
The way I want to
I just want to kiss and hug you
Oh, yeah, it's true, I do
Can't you see, it's you and me
Not them, not those, not they
You and me, baby, yeah

Oh-oh, child
Ooh, baby, oh, yeah
Want to see my bad side
I just want to treat you right now, baby
Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me
Treat you right now, baby
Treat you good, you know I could if you let me

Well, well, baby, well, baby, yeah

Why you want to see my bad side
Baby, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
Oh, yeah, it's true, you do
Why don't you just let me love you
The way I want to
I just want to kiss and hug you
Oh, yeah, it's true, I do
Can't you see, it's you and me
Not them, not those, not they
You and me, baby

// Feeling You, Feeling Me //

I'm feeling you
Feeling me, feeling you
The tenderness, the thought
The dream I've always sought, I see

Emotions clearly state what both of us are feeling
Words would get in the way, your moves are so revealing
I like your look of love and it's reciprocal
Hush now, don't say you care, my whole being is aware

I'm feeling you
Feeling me, feeling you
We touch, we understand
With words unspoken, we agree

This magic moment brings a unique sensation
And I'm responding to the soul of your vibration
I see your eyes aglow and I know that you know
Hush now, don't say you care, my whole being is aware

Of you feeling me
Feeling me, feeling you

Yes, baby, ah, yes, baby
Feeling you, feeling me

It's always happening in storybooks and movies
And now it's happening to me and, ooh, it sure is groovy
I like your look of love and it's reciprocal
Hush now, don't say you care, my whole being is aware

Of you feeling me
Feeling me, feeling you
I'm feeling you
Feeling me, feeling you
Feeling you
I'm feeling you

Feeling you, feeling me
Feeling you, feeling me
Feeling you, feeling me
Feeling, feeling
Feeling me, feeling you, feeling me
Feels so good...

// Madam X //

The night is alive
With music and laughter and people everywhere
The discotheque's fool, yeah
I search a few face and hope you will be there

Ooh, baby, you're Madam X
Extremely, exciting
I see you out and you're in
Enchanting, inviting

I saw you again last night
Out with some guy you know
I wanted to hold you tight
And tell you how I love you so

Do you know I'm there
Do you feel my presence when I'm in the crowd
(Oh, yeah)
Do you hear my prayer
Do you hear me silently calling out loud

Ooh, to you, I'm Mr. X
X'd out now, excluded
Times when I try to be in
I invaded, intruded

Ooh, baby, yeah

My love come alive
To the beat of your drum
I only survive on thoughts
That soon our day will come

Ooh, baby, you're Madam X
Extremely, exciting
I see you out and you're in
Enchanting, inviting

// Shoe Soul //

I might as well be boots or brogans or some sneakers
You've walked on me for a country mile
You take the part of me that's weak
And try to make it weaker
You've got your souls confused
In case you haven't heard the news

Shoe soul was made for walking on
My soul was made for somebody to comfort
Same sound but different as up and down
Tread softly now
Don't stampede
Ð¡ause my soul is the soul you really need

I've been your bridge over troubled waters
In your time of crisis
Your jacket laid across a puddle of mud
And when you're down and out and in need, I've been the nicest
Red carpet, welcome mat
But oh my soul's worn out from that

Shoe soul was made for walking on
My soul was made for somebody to comfort
Same sound but for you I lay me down
Tread softly now
Don't stampede
Cause my soul is the soul you really need

To walk beside
Don't mean to be a sidewalk

Shoe soul was made for walking on
Shoe soul is made of rubber, crepe and leather
My soul was made for holding on
Help me hold our souls together
Shoe soul was made for walking on
Shoe soul was made of rubber, crepe and leather
My soul, my soul was made for holding on

// Trying It Again //

Trying it again
This time I've gotta win
I'm trying again to reach your love
The signs of time were wrong
You couldn't belong
You felt your high was much above
Though in your heart you knew what to do, well
You wouldn't listen to what it said
Your mind took control of body and soul
And caused you to be misled

But I'm gonna keep trying
There's no, no, denying
I'm try, try, trying to reach your love, yeah
I'm trying to reach your love, baby

Well, I'm calling on you, girl, to be my world
Every ocean, very continent
Be the sky, be the sun, be my all, be my one
The one that heaven must have sent
You get low, you got class
Take it slow, you're too fast
There's time to do it all
Baby, now is the time
Take your love, make it mine
Why don't you hear my call

'Cause I'm gonna keep trying
There's no, no, denying
I'm try, try, trying to reach your love, oh...
I'm trying to reach your love, baby
Reach you love, yeah
I'm trying to your love, baby

I'm trying to your love

Oh, I'm gonna keep trying
There's no, no, denying
I'm try, try, trying to reach your love
I'm trying to reach your love, baby
Trying to reach your love, baby

I'm trying to reach your love
I'm trying it again, yeah
Trying to reach your love, baby
Yeah, yeah
I'm trying to reach your love
Trying it again
Oh, trying to reach your love, baby
Trying it again...

// Daylight & Darkness //

Midnight sun, shining through my darkest night
Noonday shadow, blocking out my morning light
You don't even know what I'm talking about
It's what you do when you're just being you
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time, oh, baby
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time

Flaming candle, hey, burning me with sweet desire
Icy cold, hard to handle, back and forth from ice to fire
You don't even know what you're putting me through
With all these bittersweet things that you do
How can you be daylight and darkness, at the same time, oh...
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time

Oh, baby, oh, baby

You don't even know what I'm talking about
It's just your way, baby, that's what you say
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time
How can, how can you be daylight and darkness at the same time

Ah, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
Ooh... darkness, darkness, darkness
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time
Same time, same time, my baby
Baby, at the same time

// I'm Loving You Softly //

Softly, softly

Baby, don't cry
I'm loving you softly
Baby, don't cry
I'm not that hard on you
Baby, don't cry
Your tears just might cost me
Where does it hurt

If you say it's your life
Then I gotta ease your pressure
So that you can see just who I am
And if you say it's our love
Then I gotta make it tighter
But not so tight that you can't breathe
Don't you understand

Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm loving you softly
Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm not that hard on you
Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
Your tears just might cost me
Where does it hurt

If you say it's your mind
Then I've got to come inside you
To help you find a way to soothe your thoughts
'Cause those tears that you shed
Just don't become you
So lay down with me in love and we'll get lost

Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm loving you softly
Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm not that hard on you
Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
Your tears just might cost me
Where does it hurt

Oh, show me, baby...

Oh, baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry, no, no, no
Let me wipe away all your tears
Wash away all your fears
Don't cry no more
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm here, oh...
Don't cry no more, baby
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm here

Show me where it hurts
(Baby, don't you cry)
Show me
I'll do everything I can for you
(Baby, don't you cry)
You know me
Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
Don't cry no more
Was it something that I did...
