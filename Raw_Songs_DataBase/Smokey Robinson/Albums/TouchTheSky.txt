Album: TouchTheSky

// Touch The Sky //

Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Touch the sky

Somebody sold you a bill of goods
It turned out bad
But don't you know you're not the only fool
Love ever had
Love let you go
So you're sinking low
But hold on to me and together we can...

Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Baby, we can both touch the sky
Touch the sky

Reach up and grab you a piece of it
Take you a share
Don't you know you're within reach of it
From anywhere
You're just out of touch
From hurtin' so much
But take my hand and you know we can...

Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Baby, we can both touch the sky
Touch the sky

Ooh, yeah
Touch it, touch it
Baby

Down in the dumps is a crowded place
You're one of the crowd, yeah
Why be among them when you could be
High on a cloud
You're in a rut
How come and for what
You don't have to be
Come lovin' with me

(Touch the sky)
And touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it
(Touch the sky)
You and I can touch the sky
Baby we can both touch the sky
Touch the sky, touch the sky

Ooh, yeah...

Touch it, touch it...

Baby, you and I can touch the sky
Baby, you and I can touch the sky
Baby, you and I can touch the sky
Touch it, touch it, touch it
Ooh, yeah, oh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

Touch the sky
Touch the sky
You and I could touch it, touch it, touch it
Touch it, touch it, touch it
Touch it, touch it, touch it
Touch it, touch it, touch it...

// Gimme What You Want //

It's no good, it's no fun
You're unhappy with ten secret loves
If your lover has one
It's no fair, you say there's no way
You're unhappy with all of the rules
When your lover starts to play, starts to play
All the little games that you've been playing
Two can play the game, there's an old, old saying
What you give is what you get

So if you plant the seeds of wildflower
Don't expect to tame a mild flower
If you plan to cheat and keep on lying
Don't expect for me to sit home crying
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby

There's no tears, there's no laughter
True love leaves you and you're just a shell
For the ones who come after
The ones who come after
Every square inch of ground you cover
Will circle back to hunt you down, lover
What you give is what you get

So if you plant the seeds of wildflower
Don't expect to tame a mild flower
If you plan to cheat and keep on lying
Don't expect for me to sit home crying
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby, oh...

Yeah

There's no joy, no smile
It's no fun taming all your playthings
If your real thing runs wild, runs wild
Think about it, baby
That's all you gotta do
And give me what you'd give me
If I were you
'Cause what you give is what you get

So if you plant the seeds of wildflower
Don't expect to tame a mild flower
If you plan to cheat and keep on lying
Don't expect for me to sit home crying
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby

If you plant the seeds of wildflower
Don't expect to tame a mild flower
If you plan to cheat and keep on lying
Don't expect for me to sit home crying
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby...

// Even Tho' //

Even tho' love was just a game to me
You are my lady, I can't set you free
Even tho' at times, I broke our sacred vow
I needed you then, I need you now
Even tho' your tears flow like falling rain
I'll kiss you, love you, wipe away your pain
Even tho', even tho', even tho'

Ooh, baby, baby, don't leave me to cry
It's still a great love affair
I've been the fool, I've been the fool
Even tho' we almost made it there

Ooh, baby, baby, don't leave me to cry
It's still a great love affair
I've been the fool, I've been the fool
Even tho' we almost made it there

Stay here with me, lady
Walk with me through sun and rain
I'll make you happy, my lady
Love will never be the same
Even tho', even tho', even tho'
Even tho', even tho', even tho'
Even tho', even tho', even tho'

// Gone Again //

Gone again
You never seem to need me
'Til I'm gone again
I remember when
I had never gone from you before

Every now and then
At night I wake up crying
'Cause I'm gone again
And, lately, where I've been
Makes me need to be with you once more

But makin' up and breakin' up
Is taking up too much of our precious time
So this time, I'm gonna wait 'til when
I can return and never be gone again, again

Oh, but makin' up and breakin' up
Is taking up too much of our precious time
So this time, I'm gonna wait 'til when
I can return and never be gone again, again

This time, I'm gonna wait 'til when
I can return and never be gone again, again
I'm gonna wait 'til when
I'm gonna wait 'til when
I can return and never be gone again, again
Gone, gone again

// All My Life's A Lie //

All my life's a lie
I've been telling everybody
You belong to me
All my life's a lie
Thinking you were mine and all the time
You've been running free

No triangle ties for you and me
No hanky panky
Yes, that was the vow I lived by for you
And how did you thank me
By doing the things we promised each other
We would never do
By running around and painting the town
And breaking my heart in two

All my life's a lie
I've been telling everybody
You belong to me
All my life's a lie
Thinking you were mine and all the time
You've been running free

If you've gotta play, it seems like you
Would be more discreet
And not be so thoughtless enough to expose
Your game in the streets
Now think about me and how it would be
If you were in my place
Just be for real and think how you'd feel
I don't even wanna show my face

Yeah

All my life's a lie
I've been telling everybody
You belong to me
All my life's a lie
Thinking you were mine and all the time
You've been running free

All my life's a lie
I've been telling everybody
You belong to me
All my life's a lie, my life's a lie
Thinking you were mine and all the time
You've been running free
...

// Sad Time //

It's a sad time
There's no more love left in it
It's a bad time
There's no good way to quit it
There's a heartache coming, yes, I know
You'd think I
You'd think I'd just let it go, but no

I remember the good times
The love we shared together
You and me times
It just couldn't get no better
But I can't keep holding memories
They don't touch me
But they just won't let me be

Am I a fool to believe
That this love could last longer
Am I a fool If I leave
When this love could grow stronger
What do you do when you know
That your love's breaking down
Do you walk away, do you turn it around, oh...

It's a sad time
It's a bad, bad, bad time

Am I a fool to believe
That this love could last longer
Am I a fool If I leave
When this love could grow stronger
What do you do when you know
That your love's breaking down
Do you walk away, turn it around, oh...

It's a sad time
There's no more love left in it
It's a bad time
No good way to quit it
It's a sad, sad, sad time, yeah
It's a bad, bad, bad time, ooh, yeah
Sad, sad, sad time, yeah
Bad, bad, bad time, ooh, yeah
Sad time, sad time
No more love left in it

// Dynamite //

Making love to you is dynamite
Just a touch can make my soul ignite
Then you kiss me and you light the fuse
Kiss me, woman, yeah
Our lips were made to use, ooh, baby
I can't wait 'til the fire goes to the load
That makes the love we feel inside explode

Ooh, baby, it's dynamite, dynamite
Girl, I love it when you blow my mind

Making love to you is T-N-T
That explodes into ecstasy, oh...
Don't you want to feel that feeling too
Feel it woman, yeah, while I'm close to you, oh...
What's the deal, that power you possess
That blasts me off to joy and happiness

Ooh, baby, it's dynamite
Oh, girl, it's dynamite
Girl, I love it when you blow my mind

Blow me away, baby
Blow me away, baby
Blow me away, baby
Blow me away, baby

Ooh, could it be that you and me
'Cause some kind of force that has a strong reaction
All I know is what I feel
To be with you means total satisfaction

I come to you with true love and that's a fact
All the king's men and horses couldn't hold me back
Oh, I can't wait to be close as we can get
Anticipation of you has me so upset

Ooh, it's dynamite
Oh, girl, it's dynamite, ooh...
I love it when you blow my mind, ah...
It's dynamite, oh, girl, it's dynamite
I love it when you blow my mind
Blow me away

Blow me away, baby
Blow me away, baby
Ah, blow me away, baby
Ah, blow me away, baby

Ooh, it's dynamite
Oh, girl, it's dynamite
I love it when you blow me away
Blow me away
Blow me away, baby...

// I've Made Love To You A Thousand Times //

I've made love to you a thousand times
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

It's so real, when I dream about you
I can feel you in the morning
All day long the feeling of my dream
Comes on me without warning
I'm standing there, and suddenly
There you are all over me

I've made love to you a thousand times
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

Let it be, let it really happen
Set me free form love's desire
And if my imagination is any indication
Then of your love, I'll never tire
Oh, hold me close, kiss me sweet
Then repeat it and repeat it and repeat

And after I've made love to you a thousand times
And after I've made love to you a thousand ways
I'm gonna wanna keep on with the real thing
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

Oh, I've made love to you a thousand times
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

Now I wanna keep on with the real thing
Keep on with the real thing
Keep on, keep on, keep on with the real thing
For a thousand nights and a thousand days, ooh...

I've made love to you a thousand times
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days, ooh...

I've made love to you a thousand times
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

For a thousand nights and a thousand days...

// Blame It On Love //

We had our chance
Lord knows how we tried
To keep our love alive
To keep it strong
So if I hurt you girl
Try and understand
You can't go on pretending
When we know it's ending

Blame it on love
On the memories that linger in the night
Love never showed us how to make it right
So baby
Blame it on love tonight

We had our time
It went by so fast
We tried to make it last
To make it right

We gave it all we had
Girl don't look so sad
Let's go out remembering a happier ending

Blame it on love
On the memories that linger in the night
Love never showed us how to make it right
So baby (so baby)
Blame it on love tonight

There ain't no use in harping on
Girl it's time to let it be
We did all we could
And it won't do no good
To blame it on you and me

Blame it on love
On the dreams we shared that won't come true
On the feeling that our love would always see us through

So baby, (so baby) let's blame it on love tonight

We can blame it on love
On the dreams we shared that won't come true
On the feeling that our love would always see us through

// Just Like You //

Baby, I can tell what's wrong
My heart has been cold too long
Come fill me up with love
My heart yearns for passion

Yes, my eyes will soon light up
Tears of joy inside, each drop
Since you came in my life
Things began to happen

There's a girl on my mind all of the time
Funny, she looks just like you
There's a song in my heart, tearing it apart
Searching for love just like you

You're some kind of lover
Some kind of friend
(Together)
We'll be together till the end
Come fill me up with love
My heart years for passion

There's a girl on my mind all of the time
Funny, she looks just like you
There's a song in my heart, tearing it apart
Searching for love just like you
(Tearing it apart, tearing it apart, just like you)

There's a girl on my mind all of the time
Funny, she looks just like you
There's a song in my heart, tearing it apart
Searching for love just like you
(Searching for love, searching for love)

There's a girl on my mind all of the time
Funny, she looks just like you
There's a song in my heart, tearing it apart
Searching for love just like you...

// Don't Play Another Love Song //

Don't play another love song
Please, Mr. DJ
Don't play another love song

I have always felt from the heart
We're so much more together than we are apart
And I know it's true

While the city sleeps under the stars
And the moon creeps its way across my heart
And the songs we made love to
Are playing in my car

And they break my heart
Got me wonderin' where you are

Please don't play another love song
Play a broken heart song
Don't make me cry alone
I've got no use for love songs
Now that I'm on my own
It's such a perfect night
To hold somebody tight
Oh, please don't play another love song tonight

And if I ask to much, please understand
That I've lost touch and I might need a hand
And your music has got me missin' her again

And it breaks my heart
Wonderin' where she'll be tonight
Wonderin' where she'll be tonight

Please don't play another love song
Play a broken heart song
Don't make me cry alone
I've got no use for love songs
Now that I'm on my own
Well, it's such a perfect night
To hold somebody tight
Please don't play another love song tonight
Don't play another love song

I have always felt from the heart
We're so much more together than we are apart, yeah
And I know it's true

So please don't play another love song
Play a broken heart song
Don't make me cry alone
I've got no use for love songs
Now that I'm on my own
It's such a perfect night
To hold somebody tight
Oh, please don't play another love song tonight

Don't play another love song
Please, Mr. DJ
Don't play another love song
Please, Mr. DJ...

// Just A Touch Away //

You see, love is so close
Turn out the lights
Just a touch away
I got love on my mind
Just you and me
No need to rush this feeling
We're just a touch away
We'll just take our time

Girl, it's you and me all night
Holding each other so tight
Love is so close
It's just a touch away
(Just a touch away, baby)

Turn on the music
Let the feeling grow
Let's get into the rhythm
Take it nice and slow

Baby, it's you and me all night
Holding each other so tight
Love is so close
We're just a touch away

Ooh, baby, it's you and me all night
Holding each other so tight
Love is so close
We're just a touch away

Ooh, baby, I'm reaching out for you
Come to me now
We're so close, we're so close

So close, ooh, yeah

Ooh, yes, it's you and me all night
Holding each other so tight
Love is so close
We're just a touch away

(All night)
All night long
Holding each other so tight
Love is so close
We're just a touch away

(Just a touch away, baby)
Just a touch, just a touch
(Just a touch away)
Ooh-wee, baby
(Just a touch away, baby)
Just a touch
(Just a touch away)
Oh yeah

Just a touch away, baby
(Just a touch away, baby)
Yeah
(Just a touch away)
Just a touch away
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Ooh, just a touch away
(Just a touch away)
You'll need me, baby, yeah...
