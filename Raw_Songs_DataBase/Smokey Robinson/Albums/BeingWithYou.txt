Album: BeingWithYou

// Being With You //

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

Honey don't go, don't leave this scene
Be out of the picture and off of the screen
Don't let them say "we told you so"
They tell me you'll love me and then let me go

I've heard the warning voice
From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say, no
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

People can change, they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be, that like love I am blind?
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?

One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you
Being with you
Being with you

I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you
I wanna be with you
I don't care if they start to avoid me

// Food For Thought //

Hey, tobacco man
Tell me if you can
How much money would you make off that cigarette
If your only son should partake
And then proceed to get
T.B. or Cancer, I got to know the answer

Industrial tycoon
You must see pretty soon
If you don't stop pouring that poison waste
Down into the water
There might not be any left to taste
Think of your thirsty daughter
You'd sure sound funny
Saying, "come on, honey
Let's try to drink this money"

Well, I'm not trying to tell you what to do
But he who spins the web sometimes gets caught
I'm not trying to fill you full of bull
I'm just feeding you some food for thought

(Food for thought)
A little food for thought
(Food for thought)
(Food for thought)
Yes I am
(Food for thought)

Hey, man on the run
Out there having fun
Trying to gander all the gooses
Stallion all the mares
At home, she's immune to all your excuses
For not being there
Now maybe she's got
Somebody there when you're not

Well, I'm not trying to tell you what to do
But he who spins the web sometimes gets caught
I'm not trying to fill you full of bull
I'm just feeding you some food for thought

(Food for thought)
A little food for thought
(Food for thought)
You better listen, people
(Food for thought)
A little food for thought
(Food for thought)
Trying to tell you
(I'm just feeding you some food for thought)
Trying to tell you
(Food for thought)

Well, mother who's a wife
Don't misuse your life
Makin', takin' care of babies
All you ever do
You've got to fill daddy's needs
'Cause he's your baby too
Your attention slipping
Will make daddy start tipping
Out, that is

Well, I'm not trying to tell you what to do
But he who spins the web sometimes gets caught
Oh, I'm not trying to fill you full of bull
I'm just feeding you some food for thought

(Food for thought)
A little food for thought
(Food for thought)
You better listen, people
(Food for thought)
A little food for thought
(Food for thought)

Trying to tell you
(I'm just feeding you some food for thought)
Trying to tell you
Listen, people
(Food for thought)
Food for thought
(Food for thought)

Listen, people
(I'm just feeding you some food for thought)
Trying to tell you
Food for thought
(Food for thought)
Oh-oh, food for thought
(Food for thought)

Listen, people
(I'm just feeding you some food for thought)
Trying to tell you
Trying to tell you
Trying to tell you
A little food for thought...

// If You Wanna Make Love (Come 'Round Here) //

This may take me all night long
I hope you're prepared to stay
Let's put on our favorite song
Let's put all our cares away

If you wanna make love
If you wanna make heartache and frustration disappear
If you wanna make time
If you wanna make more than conversation

Come 'round here
Oh, baby
(Come 'round here)
Baby, why don't you
(Come 'round here)
Come 'round here, babe, come 'round here

Make some hurt and make some joy
Make yourself a few mistakes
Make up, make fun, make believe
There are many makes you can make

But when you wanna make love
When you wanna make heartache and frustration disappear
When you wanna make time
And more than conversation

Come 'round here
Baby, baby, why don't you
(Come 'round here)
Come 'round with me, baby
(Come 'round here)
Come 'round here, babe, come 'round here

Yeah, when you wanna make love
When you wanna make heartache and frustration disappear
When you wanna make time
More, more, baby

Come round here
Baby, baby, why don't you
(Come 'round here)

When you wanna make love
Heartache and frustration disappear
Time, time
More than conversation

Come round here
Oh, baby, why don't you
(Come 'round here)

When you wanna make love...

// Who's Sad //

I just can't get used to losin' you
All of the dreams we had, turned out so bad
Couldn't read the writing on the wall
I got caught off guard and it hit me so hard

There's not a smile left in my world
Since I lost you, girl

Sad, who's sad, ooh, baby, not me
Just because you my love behind
Sad, who's sad, not me
Just a couple more years and I'll be fine, fine

I wake up, my bad dream just gets worse
Walkin' the same old street where we used to meet
Nothin' seems to matter anymore (nothing)
When something deep inside has withered and died

There's not a smile left in my world
Since I lost you, girl

Sad, who's sad, ooh, baby, not me
Just because you my love behind
Sad, sad, who's sad, ooh, not me
Just a couple more years and I'll be fine, fine

There's no runnin' away
No way to forget
Forget that I'm empty inside
My life has no love
No love without you
Without you here in my life

('Cause there's not a smile left in my world
Ever since I lost you, girl)

Sad, who's sad, ooh, baby, not me
Just because you my love behind
Sad, sad, who's sad, not me
Just a couple more years and I'll be fine

Sad, what makes you think I'm sad
Ooh, not me
Just because you my love behind
Sad, sad, sad, sad, oh, baby, not me...

// Can't Fight Love //

You may think that you can run and hide
But that won't change the things you feel inside, oh...
You can't hide your love away
'Cause everywhere you go
Love will follow right behind
Baby, don't you know that you...

Can't fight love
Don't you know that you can never win
Can't fight love
Can't fight love, so c'mon, girl, give in

You might as well try to stop the rain
You might as well try to catch the sun
You might as well whistle in the wind
Can't fight love, gotta say it again

(Can't fight love)
Yeah, gotta say it again
(Can't fight love)

You're caught at the point of no return, oh...
You can't go back once all your bridges burn, ooh, yeah
It's bigger than the both of us
So why do you pretend
You may last a round or two
But he'll get you in the end, 'cause you...

Can't fight love, oh...
Don't you know that you can never win
Can't fight love, oh...
Can't fight love, so c'mon, girl, give in

You might as well try to stop the rain
(Might as well)
You might as well try to catch the sun
(You might as well)
You might as well whistle in the wind
Can't fight love, gotta say it again

(Can't fight love)
Yeah, gotta say it again
(Can't fight love)

Oh, can't fight it
Ooh, say it again
Can't fight it
Ooh, say it again

You can't hide your love away
'Cause everywhere you go
Love will follow right behind
Baby, don't you know that you...

Can't fight love, no
Don't you know that you can never win
Can't fight love, yeah
Can't fight love, so c'mon, girl, give in

You might as well try to stop the rain
(You might as well)
You might as well try to catch the sun
(You might as well)
You might as well whistle in the wind
Can't fight love, gotta say it again

(Can't fight love)
Yeah, gotta say it again
(Can't fight love)

Ooh, can't fight it, no
Say it again
(Can't fight love)
Yeah, can't fight it
Ooh, say it again
(Can't fight love)

(Can't fight love)
Oh, can't fight it
(Can't fight love)
(Can't fight love)

Yeah...

Oh, can't fight it
Say it again, can't fight it

(You might as well)
You might as well try to stop the rain
(You might as well)
You might as well try to catch the sun
(You might as well)
You might as well whistle in the wind
Can't fight love, gotta say it again

(Can't fight love)
Yeah, say it again
Ay, can't fight it
(Can't fight love)
Ooh, can't fight it

Nobody can fight this feeling alone
(Can't fight love)
Oh...
(Can't fight love)
Nobody can fight this feeling alone
(Can't fight love)
(Can't fight love)

You might as well try to stop the rain
You might as well try to catch the sun
You might as well whistle in the wind
Can't fight love, gotta say it again

(Can't fight love)
(Can't fight love)
(Can't fight love...)

// You Are Forever //

Yeah, little darling
Little darling, little darling

Even mountains will crumble
Rivers will dry and stars will fall
And the kings will be humble
The meekest of men will be standing tall
Time changes, rearranges
Mountains and kings, everything

But you are forever
Baby, you are my now and then, oh...
You are forever
Darling, I cannot remember when
I didn't, ooh... love you

Yesterday is a memory
Tomorrow will come and fade away
But my love is eternal
I promise you it will always stay, oh...
Time changes, rearranges
Things come and go, but one thing I know is

You are forever
Baby, you are my now and then, oh...
You are forever
And, darling, I cannot remember when
I didn't want you, need you, love you
Yes, love you, ah, love you, love you, love you

Time changes, rearranges
Mountains and kings, everything

But you are forever, ooh, baby
Baby, you are my now and then
You're forever and ever and ever
I cannot remember when
I didn't love you, really love you

You're forever and ever
Baby, baby, ever, ever, and ever and ever
I, I cannot remember when
I didn't, ooh... love you
Ooh, love you, love you, love you
Can't remember when I didn't love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Love you, all my life it seemed I love you
Even high in the breeze, I love you...

// As You Do //

If I told you once, I've told you again
I don't like it
You can have your fun, but don't fool with my head
I won't buy it
Be merciful when you think of me
And try and have some sympathy
'Cause nobody means as much to me
Nobody means as much to me
As you do

If I may recall, you say that you cared
About loving
I never thought I'd see you running scared
From this love thing, yeah
If you understand the things I say
Then there's no cause to be afraid
For nobody can complete the day
Nobody can complete my day
As you do

Nobody can love, ah, nobody can share
No one person can do anything
That hurts me as much
As you do

Play it now

Oh, be merciful when you think of me
And try and have some sympathy
'Cause nobody means as much to me
Nobody means as much to me
As you do, well

As you do, nobody can love me now
As you do, nobody can make me feel as good
As you do, nobody can hurt me quite as much

As you do
As you do, yeah

// I Hear The Children Singing //

I hear the children singing
But amidst the melody
I hear a tiny voice cry
I hear the children singing
But amidst the melody
I hear a tiny voice cry

Why did we grow up
What were we thinking of
Why didn't we stay young
And so in love
I hear the children singing
But I hear a tiny voice cry

Why can't I find love
Like we knew
When we were young at play
Will I ever hear the music
Will my sadness stay
I'm only a child
A tiny voice cries

I long to hear the melody
The one we danced to yesterday
When we used to laugh sadness away

I hear the children singing
But amidst the melody
I hear a tiny voice cry

My love remains young
And memories linger on
So a grown-up like me
Is forever a child

I hear the children singing
But amidst the melody
I hear a tiny voice cry
