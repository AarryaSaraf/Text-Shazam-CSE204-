If I came back to the land of cotton
Would you love just me?
Old loves lost are ne'er forgotten
That's the way it's supposed to be

Are you short or are you long?
Are you easy to see
Are you weak or are you strong?
Makes no never to me

All the ballerina sees when her world's on fire
Is where she puts her feet
And if she burns her toes, she'll just jump higher
Never skip a beat

I've been good most of the time
Since you last saw me
You come 'cross my mind from time to time
Now look at me

I'm standing at your door
With my heart in your hands
Ain't you gonna ask me in?
If you say "no," I'll understand dear
And never come south again

If I came back to the land of cotton
Would you love just me?
Old loves lost are ne'er forgotten
That's the way it's supposed to be
