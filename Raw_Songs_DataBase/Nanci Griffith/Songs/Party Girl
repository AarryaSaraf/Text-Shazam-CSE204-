She was a party girl
Now the party's over
She was a beauty
And that's changing too
Now she's barefoot and having babies
She was a party girl
Now the party's over

Now her husband watches TV
After working hard all day
And she's crying into her pillow
'Cause it's night time
And she want's to play

She was a party girl
Now the party's over
She was a beauty
And that's changing too
Now she's barefoot and having babies
She was a party girl
Now the party's over

She can't cry to mama
She can't go home to daddy any more
They both tried to warn her
She was throwing away her sweet young life
When she walked out that door

She was a party girl
Now the party's over
She was a beauty
And that's changing too
Now she's barefoot and having babies
She was a party girl
Now the party's over
