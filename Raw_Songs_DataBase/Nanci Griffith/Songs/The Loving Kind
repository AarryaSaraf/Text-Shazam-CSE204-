They were the loving kind
She was black and he was white
In Virginia nineteen fifty-eight
They found love amongst the hate

Well the law said they could not wed
They married anyway
The sheriff put them both in jail
Separated till they made their bail

They changed the heart of a nation
With their wedding vows
From the highest court in the land
Their union would lawfully stand
Simply Mildred and Richard
That's how they'll be remembered
They proved that love is truly blind
They were the loving kind

The Lovings lived a quiet life
In their Virginia home
And while the case worked it's way through the courts
They brought three children to this world
Richard died in seventy-five
Mildred kept their love alive
Till the spring of two thousand-eight
Fifty years beyond the hate

They changed the heart of a nation
With their wedding vows
From the highest court in the land
Their union would lawfully stand
Simply Mildred and Richard
That's how they'd be remembered
They proved that love is truly blind
They were the loving kind
