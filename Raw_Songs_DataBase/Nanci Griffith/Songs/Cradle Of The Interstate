It's crystal breaking in the light of day
It's the heat of the moon that's gone it's way
And everybody's packing their wings to fly home
Leaving me here
In the cradle of the interstate alone

Fair weather friends are a damn disease
They drink my wine and take my money
Fools are reaching for a dim spotlight shine
If you want that shine
You're gonna have to write your own damn lines

It turns a warm heart cold
Hey, clear this road
Let me by

I got fog in the foothills of Tennessee
It's the Catskill mountains
And the Blue Ridge behind me
Topping my list of all I need
It's a warm cup of coffee
And a bottle of whiskey beside me

I worked so hard to build this living
In a business of hard lines
Where nobody's sharing
Fools chase their tails
For that Top 40 flight
Now the only friend that holds me
Is the cradle of the interstate

It turns a warm heart cold
Hey, clear this road
Let me by

It's crystal breaking in the light of day
It's the heat of the moon
Who's gone his way
And everybody's packing their wings to fly home
Leaving me here in the cradle of the interstate, alone

Lullaby...
Roll me gently in this cradle of the interstate home

Lullaby...
Roll me gently in this cradle of the interstate home

Lullaby...
Roll me gently in this cradle of the interstate home
