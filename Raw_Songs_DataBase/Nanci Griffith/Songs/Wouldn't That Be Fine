If you could stand behind my eyes for just one day
Could you see my heart beside you?
If you knew my love had never flown away
Would I be missing you, wouldn't that be roses
Wouldn't that be fine

If I could wash away all these years with language
Could this naked love survive the light of day
If I could be the one who walked away
Would you be missing me, wouldn't that be roses
Wouldn't that be fine?

I saw the weather change high up on the cap rock
It is my sense of place, you were my holiday
If you could hold me now and brace these broken shoulders
Wouldn't that be trust, wouldn't that be roses
Wouldn't that be fine?

If I could turn your head with the round of my pen
Leaving all we've said behind us
If I could roll these dice and finally loose my anger
Wouldn't that be love, wouldn't that be roses
Wouldn't that be fine?
