When I got up this morning
You were on my mind
You were on my mind

I got some aches and
I got some pains and
I got some wounds to bind

So I went to the corner
Just to ease my pain
Just to ease my pain

I got drunk and
I got sick and
I came home again

Well I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind

I got troubles
I got worries
I got wounds to bind
I got a feeling down in my shoes
Way down in my shoes
I got to move on
I got to travel
I got to walk away my blues

When I got up this morning
You were on my mind
You were on my mind
I got some aches and
I got some pains and
I got some wounds to bind
