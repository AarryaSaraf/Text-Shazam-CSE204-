When you are leaving the harbor
Do you cry out to the shore?
Do you bless the wave of the ocean
Do you call your vessel home?

As you leave the safest harbor
Do you wonder where you'll go?
When you feel your bough is breaking
Do you call that harbor home?

When you sing the lullaby
Do you sing it for the song?
Or do you love the way it slides
Like velvet 'cross your tongue?

And as you sing the lullaby
Do you savor every line?
Or do they flow as one with your heartbeat
With your voice and your mind?

If you turn the light out in the hallway
Will your shadow lose its way?
Or do we share these shadows in the darkness
And they move from place to place?

We could share a shadow in the darkness
As shadows have no face
But should you sell our soul to the darkness
Can you face the light of the day?

When you are leaving the harbor
Do you cry out to the shore?
Oh, do you bless the wave of the ocean?
Do you call your vessel home?
Oh, do you bless the wave of the ocean?
Do you call your vessel home?
