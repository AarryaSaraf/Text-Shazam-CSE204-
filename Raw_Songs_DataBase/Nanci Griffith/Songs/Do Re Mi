Well, thousands of folks back east, they say
Are leavin' home most every day
They're beatin' the hot ol' dusty way
To the California line
Across the desert sands they roll
A-gettin' outta that ol' dust bowl
They think they're goin' to a sugar bowl
But here is what they find
The police at the port of entry say
"You're number 14,000 for today"

If you ain't got the Do Re Mi, boys
If you ain't got that Do Re Mi
Oh, you'd better go back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Georgia, Kansas, Tennessee
California is a garden of Eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the Do Re Mi

Well, if you want to buy you a home or farm
That can't deal nobody harm
Or take your vacations by the mountains or the sea
Don't swap your old cow for a car
You'd better stay right where you are
You better take this little tip from me
'Cause I look through the want ads every day
And the headlines in the papers always say

If you ain't got the Do Re Mi, boys
If you ain't got that Do Re Mi
Oh, you'd better go back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Georgia, Kansas, Tennessee
California is a garden of Eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the Do Re Mi
