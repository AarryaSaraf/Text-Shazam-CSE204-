You honk the horn on your Mercedes Benz
I've rolled up my windows so you're honkin' again
Your stereo could drive the devil out
Hey, you drink too much and talk too loud
But you think you got it made
Think you got it made
Think you got it made
When you're one blade shy of a sharp edge

Republican is the way you vote
You've got a sticker on your bumper that's how I know
And you think true love is around the bend
You've been around the bend since the age of ten
But, you think you've got it made
Think you got it made
Think you got it made
When you're one blade shy of a sharp edge

Now, I'm a little too old for your toupe curls
I'm a full grown woman and you're lookin' for girls
Hey, it's a Saturday night so go on down the road
I'll cancel you out when I go to the polls
But you think you got it made
Think you got it made
Think you got it made
When you're one blade shy of a sharp edge

Hey, hey...
