We don't live on easy street, but it's home
Looking out on the open road, where you'll go it alone
To the last of our simple days, we'll wave good-bye
Down this road we're grown
It's our very own

This is not a one-horse town, we're not alone
It's somewhere off the beaten track, we're loyal to the bone
Everybody's got their place, and got their role to play
We should never change our rules
'Cause it's our very own

Youth is but a breath in time
A cruise around the square
You swore you'd never be your folks
And suddenly you're there
You think you'll choose a different road
Than the one that you've been shown
But in the end we're in the square
And it's our very own

We don't live on easy street, but it's home
Looking out on the open road, where you'll go it alone
To the last of our simple days, we'll wave goodbye
Down this road we've grown
It's our very own

Come December
Come what may
We'll recall our simple days
And we'll always know
They were our very own
