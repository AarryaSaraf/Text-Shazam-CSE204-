She's a brown skin girl from El Paso City
He's a sweet tempered soldier from Fort Bliss
They ran off one July evening
All concerned said this one is anyone's guess

Love conquers all
Love conquers all
And to all concerned you'll survive that fall
Cause love conquers all

She's a rest home bride up in New Jersey
It's her first trip down the aisle, and it's his second time around
All concerned said she looked so pretty
Dressed in white though she's wheel chair bound

Whether you're young or old
Near or far
Down the road of life
Your chances are
To all concerned... love conquers all

She's a Muslim girl from Motor City
He's an uptight Irish Catholic boy
They found their love in a class on history
And the bells of Ann Arbor rang with joy

And it's love, love, love... love conquers all
Yes it's love, love, love... love conquers all
