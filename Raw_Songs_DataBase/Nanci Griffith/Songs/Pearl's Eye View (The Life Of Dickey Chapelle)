Oh, she was high up there in the air
Caught still by a soldier's stare
Whenever it was men amongst men
Down upon the land
And she followed those mothers' sons
She felt the thunder of their guns
From a pearl's eye view, just a camera in her hand
She was born Georgette but the name
Didn't suit her well
So, she blew out of Wisconsin as Dickey Chapelle

So, she flew with a pilot's pride
The first witness to either side
She carried relief to the lost ones
Between the bombs
And we saw it all through her lens
She knew she'll go back again
When the call rang out once more from Vietnam
She's been through this before
She'll tell ya war is hell
Her pearl earrings caught the light
On Dickey Chapelle

Oh, that's the way it was
She was the only one to tell
In 1962
She blew the whistle loud and clear
Now we trace her wings
In her footsteps without fear
To the front lines where she fell
Where she lies still
But she's still there

It was 1965
Over Chu Lai in a free fall dive
In a dawn patrol to cover the dead zone ground
She tiptoed through the land mines
All along the enemy lines
But she never saw the one that took her down
She captured the bloody pearls of war so well
That war was bound to steal the end of Dickey Chapelle

Dickey Chapelle (from a pearl's eye view)
Dickey Chapelle (from a pearl's eye view)
Dickey Chapelle (from a pearl's eye view)
Dickey Chapelle
