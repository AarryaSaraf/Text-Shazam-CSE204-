I am fragile in the morning
I grow stronger in the day
I can sprint like a new spring doe
By the fall of night
Love has chased me down
Through the cities and the towns
Until I stood beside the road
And let it pass me by
Like a fool I've missed the rain
Cause I was crying

Then you are calling
Call my heart awake from years of slumber
And then I'm falling
Like a child head over heel
In fields of summer
Can you hold me?
Though I'm inclined to
Leave my home and wander
Can you keep me
Like a child head over heel
In fields of summer?
Fields of summer
Fields of summer
I am falling
Like a child head over heel
In fields of summer

Now that you have caught me
Are you sure you really want me?
Though I'm fragile as December
On your shoulder in the dawn
And when the day has made me stronger
Can you satisfy my hunger?
When the night has come
And I would race the moon across the sky
Would you chase me through
Those open fields of summer?

Can you hold me?
Hold me?
Hold me?
Because I'm falling
Like a child head over heel
In fields of summer
