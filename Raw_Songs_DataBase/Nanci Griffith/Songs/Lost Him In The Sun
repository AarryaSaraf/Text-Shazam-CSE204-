Any given day there's a jet flying somewhere
Oh, we bought a ticket and vanished in the sky
And how was I to know he was leaving in the morning
I never heard him go and then he never said goodbye
I've learned to love the night cause the light's gonna get ya
Right between the eyes in the morning like a gun
And reaching out your hand and he's not there beside you
Oh, what can I say, I lost him in the sun
Hey and what have I done?
I lost him in the sun
I lost him in the sun

Oh, I lost him in the sun
Oh, I lost him in the sun
Yeah, I lost him in the sun
Yeah, I lost him in the sun

Fire up your hearts cause the wind is getting cold
It always get cold for the riders of the night
You carry that scar when you know what lonely is
Looking for a home like a bird, like a bird in flight
Oh, and what have I done?
Yeah, I lost him in the sun
Yeah, I lost him in the sun
