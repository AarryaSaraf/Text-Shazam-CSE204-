Let me say this one more time
Just in case you didn't hear it right
I'd put it in my own words
So I'll know it's understood
You sent me out on a limb
You brought me home... sent me back again
Out on that limb one too many times
You should've known I'd learn to fly

You can have anything on earth you need
Anything that breathes you can surely still its wings
You can have everything on earth you see
Anything on earth you need but me
You can have anything you need but me now
Anything on earth you need but me

Well, I'm shattered as the broken glass
Around the wreck out on the tracks
You had the very heart of me in your hands with honesty
You rolled it up within your sleeve like a beacon
Then you left it out
In the cold and the rain
I've picked it up and brought it home again

You can have anything on earth you need
Anything that breathes you can surely still its wings
You can have everything on earth you see
Anything on earth you need but me
You can have anything you need but me now
Anything on earth you need but me

Well, it's time to move the lights are green
After all it's love we need
And if it doesn't dance and breathe
Then it doesn't grow it seems
My headlights catch you with my love upon your sleeve
You're standin' still in the middle of this road
It's time to pass you by and go

You can have anything on earth you need
Anything that breathes you can surely still its wings
You can have everything on earth you see
Anything on earth you need but me
You can have anything you need but me now
Anything on earth you need but me

You can have anything you need but me now
Anything on earth you need but me
Anything on earth you need but me
