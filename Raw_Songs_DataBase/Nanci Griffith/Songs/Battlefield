I live on a battlefield
Surrounded by the ruins of a love we built
And then destroyed between us, the smoke has cleared
As I stumble through the rubble, I'm dazed and seein' double
And I'm truly mystified

My new home is a shell-hole
Filled with tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart
All around there is desolation
And scenes of devastation
Of a love being torn apart
I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield

I live on a battlefield
The one where not one single drop of
Blood has spilled
Is no less horrifying, sweet memories
Of a bygone situation
Now shattered, Lord and battered
Lies scattered all around

My new home is a shell-hole
Filled with tears and muddy water
Yes, and bits of broken heart
All around there is desolation
And scenes of devastation
Of a love being torn apart
I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield

Everything that can and has gone wrong
(I live on a battlefield)
It's gonna take spine to carry on
(I live on a battlefield)
Like a drownin' man comin' up for air
(I live on a battlefield)
I'm looking for another survivor
But I can't see one anywhere

My new home
(My home is filled with muddy water)
All around
(All around, there's bit of broken heart)
My world
(My world)
Is one of desolation, and scenes of devastation
There is no consolation, for a love been torn apart

I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield, battlefield
I live on a battlefield
(My home is filled with muddy water)
I live on a battlefield, battlefield
I live on a battlefield
(All around, there's bits of broken heart)
I live on a battlefield, battlefield
I live on a battlefield
(My home is filled with muddy water)
