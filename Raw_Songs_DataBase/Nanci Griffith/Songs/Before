I dreamed of Louisiana
And a night in Lafayette
We had breakfast with Susanna
We were young and wild and left

What's different here than in that dream
And in reality
Is we weren't afraid to fail in love
And we all believed in the dream
Before... before

I dreamed of Manhattan
In a time before this war
It was snowing down on Bleecker Street
It was before you were a star

Now everything is twilight
It's a time too dark to see
It's fear of being what we were
And pondering the dream

Then I dreamed of Texas
And the Gulf Coast shores
I dreamed of who we used to be
And the hope we had before
