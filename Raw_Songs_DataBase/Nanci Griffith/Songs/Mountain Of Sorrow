Easy come, easy go
Anything but easy... though
You were here, now you're gone
That's the only thing I know

And it's just one more sorrow
To throw upon the heap
Mountain of sorrow... steep

What you see, the new me
Changing right before your eyes
Like a leaf on a tree
Letting go before she flies

And it's just one more sorrow
To throw upon the heap
Mountain of sorrow... steep

Mountain of sorrow
How high the top
Must I climb, must I climb
Ever blue
Mountain of sorrow
When I can I stop
And be fine
Knowing I'm over you?

Easy come, easy go
Anything but easy... though
Said goodbye, knowing I
Would have rather said hello

And it's just one more sorrow
To throw upon the heap
Mountain of sorrow... steep
Mountain of sorrow... steep
