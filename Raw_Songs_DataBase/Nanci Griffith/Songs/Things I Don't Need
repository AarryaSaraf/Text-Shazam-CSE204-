This house is full of memories that aren't mine
Pieces, I thought I would clear out over time
Life takes over, I get ahead of myself
I turn around and I've filled up the shelf

With things I don't need that weigh me down
Things I don't want but still keep around
I woke up today and I made up my mind
From now on I'll leave all those things I don't need behind

The one thing that's not on the shelf is my heart since it fell
Picking it up is a thing that I've never have done well
True love always seems to fly by me
I wonder if it's one of those things I don't need

Things I don't need that weigh me down
Things I don't want but still keep around
I woke up today and I made up my mind
From now on I'll leave all those things I don't need behind

Like a bag you unpack at the end of a trip
And you're wondering why did I take all of this?

These things I don't need that weigh me down
Things I don't want but still keep around
I woke up today and made up my mind
From now on I'll leave all those things I don't need behind
From now on I'll leave all those things I don't need behind
