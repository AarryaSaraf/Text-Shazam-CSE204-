Rita was sixteen years, hazel eyes and chestnut hair
She made the Woolworth counter shine
And Eddie was a sweet romancer and darn good dancer
And they'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime
And they'd sing

Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time and love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Eddie played the steel guitar and his momma cried 'cause he played in the bars
And he kept young Rita out late at night
So they married up in Abilene, lost a child in Tennessee
But still that love survived

'Cause they'd sing

Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time and love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

One of the boys in Eddie's band took a shine to Rita's hand
So Eddie ran off with the bass-man's wife
Oh, but he was back by June singin' a different tune
And sporting Miss Rita back by his side
And He'd sing

Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time and love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Eddie traveled with the bar room band till arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side
And Rita's got her house to keep; she writes dime store novels of love so sweet
They dance to the radio late at night
And still sing

Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time and love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Rita was sixteen years, hazel eyes and chestnut hair
She made the Woolworth counter shine
And Eddie was a sweet romancer and darn good dancer
And they'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime
And they'd sing
