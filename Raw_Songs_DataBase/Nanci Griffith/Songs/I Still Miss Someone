At my door the leaves are falling
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

If go out on a party
To look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Because I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blue eyes
(I see)
I see them everywhere
(I miss)
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
But I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blue eyes
(I see)
I see them everywhere
(I miss)
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

At my door the leaves are falling
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

And I still miss someone
