My friends think I'm crazy and maybe it's true
'Cause I'll go on and love you this way
Though I have discovered that you love another
And hardly remember my name

My youth was so crazy, my heart was so lazy
Love never could stand me still
But, love's found a shoulder now that I'm older
With plenty of time to kill

I wish you well for your new love
'Cause true love is so hard to hold
You'll be the one that I dream of
Till I find a love of my own

Now, here I am standin' in the cold winter rain
If hearts were of wool I'd be warm
I've known some kind hearts and I've touched a few
Though I never claim one for my own

My youth was so crazy, my heart was so lazy
Love never could stand me still
But, love's found a shoulder now that I'm older
With plenty of time to kill
