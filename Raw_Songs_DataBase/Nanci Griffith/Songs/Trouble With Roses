I worked hard for that rose
You may have it when you go
'Cause it's the dreaming it lends
Worth holding here
And when the outbound lane brings me trouble again
If my heart's in the wind
I wanna hold it near

Don't say no, it's not part of this show
When the lights were down low
Your eyes were closing too
Now the bar is closing
I can leave here knowing
That the dreams are still growing
As long as you're holding that rose

My pockets are clean
Though they're empty half the time
I spend my half times in dreamin'
Least I ain't wastin' lines
And the boys that I know, Lord their questions get old
'Cause it's the boys who ask questions
And the Man who knows

Don't say no, it's not part of this show
When the lights were down low
Your eyes were closing too
Now the bar is closing
I can leave here knowing
That the dreams are still growing
As long as you're holding that rose

Take care of that rose, it's my dreams that you're holdin'
When you hold that rose
