Nothing that I've ever seen
Now means much of anything
In traveling through this part of you
And the Vietnam that I had dreamed
The place you wore your life "fatigued"
I'm traveling through this part of you

Where are you amongst this madness
On the streets of Saigon?
Where were you in 1969?
When I was but a youth
Oh, here were you
You were traveling through this part of you

I'll make my way now on my own
Back to my home to live alone
I have traveled through this part of you
Yet, I will save this time and place
For the time when I can say
I traveled truth this part of you

You were an American boy
Whose innocence was lost here in the wat
And I wear your scars
While traveling through this part of you

Nothing that I've ever seen
Now means much of anything
In traveling through this part of you
And the Vietnam that I had dreameed
The place you wore your life "fatigued"
I'm traveling through this part of you
I'm traveling through this part of you
I'm traveling through this part of you
