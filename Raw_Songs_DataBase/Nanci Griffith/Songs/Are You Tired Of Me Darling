Are you tired of me, my darling?
Did you mean those words you said
That have made me yours forever
Since the day when we were wed?

Tell me, would you live life over?
Could you make another wife?
Are you tired of me my darling?
Answer only with your eyes

Do you ever rue the springtime
When we first each other met?
How we spoke in warm affection
Words my heart can ne'er forget?

Tell me, would you live life over?
Could you make another wife?
Are you tired of me my darling?
Answer only with your eyes

Do you think the bloom's departed
From the cheeks you thought so fair?
Do you think I've grown cold-hearted
Beneath the load of woman's cares?
