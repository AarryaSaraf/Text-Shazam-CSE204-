Never hit seventeen when you play against the dealer
You know that the odds won't ride with you
And never leave your woman alone with your friends around to steal her
She'll be gambled and gone like summer wages

And we'll keep rolling on till we get to Vancouver
And the woman that I love, she's living there
It's been six long months and more since I've seen her
Maybe she's gambled and gone like summer wages

In all the beer parlors all down along Main Street
The dreams of the seasons get all spilled out on the floor
All the big stands of timber just waiting for falling
And the hookers standing watchfully, waiting by the door

So I'll work on the towboats with my slippery city shoes
Lord! I swore I would never that do again
Through the the gray fog-bound straits where the cedars stand watching
I'll be far off and gone like summer wages
...

Never hit seventeen when you play against the dealer
You know that the odds won't ride with you
And never leave your woman alone with your friends around to steal her
She'll be gambled and gone like summer wages

And the years are gambled and lost like summer wages
