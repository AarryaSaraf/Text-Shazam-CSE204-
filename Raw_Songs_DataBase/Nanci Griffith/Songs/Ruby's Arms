He will leave behind all of his clothes
He wore when he was with her
All he need's are his railroad boots
And his leather jacket
As he say goodbye to Ruby's arms
Although his heart is breaking
He will steal away out through her blinds
For soon she will be waking

Morning light has washed her face
And everything is turning blue now
She holds onto her pillow case
There's nothing he can do now
As he says goodbye to Ruby's arms
He says she'll find another soldier
And he swears to God by Christmas time
There'll be someone else to hold you

The only thing he's taking is
The scarf off of her clothesline
He'll hurry past her chest of drawers
And her broken wind chimes
As he says goodbye
He says goodbye
Goodbye to Ruby's arms

He will feel his way down her darkened hall
And out into the morning
The hobos in the freight yards
Have kept their fires burning
And Jesus Christ this cold hard rain
Won't someone put him on his train
He'll never kiss her lips again
Or break her heart
As he says goodbye
He says goodbye
Say goodbye to Ruby's arms
