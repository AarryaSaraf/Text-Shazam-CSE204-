Tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown
Tonight I think I'm gonna look around
For something that I couldn't see
When this world was more real to me
Tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown

My love, my love has gone away
My love, my love what can I say
My love would never see
That this world's just not real to me
Tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown

I told my love a thousand times
Why I can't say what's on my mind
But he would never see
That this world's just not real to me
And tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown
