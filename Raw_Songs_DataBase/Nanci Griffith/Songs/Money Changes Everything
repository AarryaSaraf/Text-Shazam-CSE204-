In the rush of the river and the roar of the crowd
You can't hear the silence calling
When it's merely a whisper of a cloud
In a crazy storm that pulls you on

Take a pill or you might take a loss
And the vicious circle tightens
But compromise comes with a cost
Maybe you can't see but it's clear to me

Money changes everything
It changes everything

Make a little and it makes your day
And the heavens smile upon you
Make a bundle and you're blown away
To a different game and the rules all change

Leave a husband or trade a wife
You're in the bigger picture now
Take a country or take a life
If it's moolah's will there's gold in them hills

Money changes everything
It changes everything
Money changes everything
It changes everything

If you think it makes your world go round
It makes your world go round
If you think it makes your world go round
It makes your world go round

Money changes everything
It changes everything
Money changes everything
It changes everything

It changes everything
It changes everything
It changes everything
