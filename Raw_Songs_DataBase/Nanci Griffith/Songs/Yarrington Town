I packed up my suitcase
Pulled down my old bedroll
And I started to wander
Far from my home
And the time it passed quickly
And the days seemed to be hours
Far from your city
And Yarrington Town

Well, I wandered through the midnights
Of sea-bordered bar lights
And I wandered through the forests
As deep as the sea
But I never got lonesome
Until I'd hear a sad song
One to remind me of Yarrington Town

Well, I followed a miner
To his home in the North woods
And he promised to love me
As long as I'd stay
And I even saw lightning
Touch a stone in the mine field
Could not touch the lightning
In Yarrington Town

So I packed up my suitcase
I pulled out my old bedroll
And I started to wander
On back to my home
And the time it passed slowly
And the days seemed to be years
Far from your city
And Yarrington Town
I'm going home to your city
And Yarrington Town
