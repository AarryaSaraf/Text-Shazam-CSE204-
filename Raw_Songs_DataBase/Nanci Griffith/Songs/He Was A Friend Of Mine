He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Never had no money
To pay for his fine
He was a friend of mine

He never done no wrong
He never done no wrong
Thousand miles from home
He never hurt no one
He was a friend of mine

He died on the road
He died on the road
Never had no money for to pay for sufficient clothes
(He was a friend)
He was a friend of mine

(I stole)
I stole away and cried
(I stole)
Never had no money and I can't be satisfied
He was a friend of mine

(He was) he was a friend of mine
(He was) he was a friend of mine
When I hear his name you know
I just can't keep from cryin' (and)
(He was) he was a friend of mine
(He was)
