You walked the line all your life
You never thought you'd have to change it
You're always there to give advice
You never thought you'd have to take it

It's still life but it's broken
It's still life when it's torn
It's still life that you're walking
On and on and on and on and on

You need to change, you don't know how
Your life could use a reformation
If you could see you as I see you now
I know you'd change the situation

It's still life but it's broken
It's still life when it's torn
It's still life that you're walking
On and on and on and on and on

It's always someone else's fault
You're always right, you're never wrong
You think that life's a game but this is real

You think you can just walk away
And leave destruction in your wake
But you're not walking anywhere near

Is it still life if you are drowning?
Is it still life when you fall?
Is it still life when you can't carry
On and on and on and on and on?

It's still life but it's broken
It's still life when you're torn
It's still life when you're walking
On and on and on and on and on and on

It's still life but it's broken
It's still life but it's torn
It's still life but you're walking
On and on and on and on and on and on and on

It's still life
