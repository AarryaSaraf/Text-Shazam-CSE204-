Sister had a crystal voice
She played a Silvertone from Montgomery Ward
Baez songs in Monroe hair
She sure could turn the boys' heads to stare
Swim wear saunter, tan and haunt them
Was all she learned in school
Books were for the other girls
And the other girls were fools
In Texas back in sixty-nine
It was drive-in movies and dashboard lights

Father waltzed her down the aisle
'Cause college didn't suit her style
The sad truth was she could barely read
If you told dear Father
Well, he wouldn't believe you
The telephone rang it drove Mother insane
From the hearts left on the shelf
Sister's gone and she won't be home
'Cause she didn't take care of herself
In Texas back in sixty-nine
It was drive-in movies and dashboard lights

Where is she now?
The backseat queen of fraternity
Where is she now?
She is heavy of thigh and light on integrity
Someone should've told her
When beauty's all you offer
How soon the world discovers that your beauty's gone
(It's gone)

Mother can't you hear your daughter crying
Father wake up her youth is dying
Her kids are grown, husband's gone away
And it's a shame 'cause she had such a lovely face
Can't you see she needed more
Than, "Oh what a pretty child"?
You never taught her truth from lie
All you told her was to smile
In Texas back in sixty-nine
It was drive-in movies and dashboard lights

In Texas back in sixty-nine
It was drive-in movies and dashboard lights
