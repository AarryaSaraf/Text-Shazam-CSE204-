She was standin' on the gone side of leavin'
She found her thumb and stuck it in the breeze
She'll take anything that's goin' close to somewhere else
She can lay it down and live it as she please

She ain't goin' nowhere
She's just leavin'
She ain't goin' nowhere
Se can't breathe in
She ain't goin' home and that's for sure

She's not sittin' down and crying on her suitcase
She has no second thoughts by the road
She's got feelings that need some repairin'
And she did not give a damn that it showed

She ain't goin' nowhere
She's just leavin'
She ain't goin' nowhere
Se can't breathe in
She ain't goin' home and that's for sure

The wind had a way with her hair
And the blues had a way with her smile
And she had a way of her own
Like prisoners have a way with a file

She ain't goin' nowhere
She's just leavin'
She ain't goin' nowhere
Se can't breathe in
She ain't goin' home and that's for sure

She ain't goin' nowhere
She's just leavin'
She ain't goin' nowhere
Se can't breathe in
She ain't goin' home and that's for sure

She ain't goin' home that's for sure
