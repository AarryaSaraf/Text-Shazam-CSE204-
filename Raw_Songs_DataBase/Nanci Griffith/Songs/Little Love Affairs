When I wake in the night and find that I'm dreaming
You're the first thought in mind
Love's a fair weather friend when you're lonely
You are my summer state of mind

Does it sing to you nightly?
Does it lay down beside you?
Does it make you hear songs on the radio?
It once was my shadow grown weary of travel
Till you gave it home

What makes the love grow when the seasons change?
What makes the love grow?
It's simple it comes and it grows on it's own

Does it sing to you nightly?
Does it lay down beside you?
Does it make you hear songs on the radio?
It once was my shadow grown weary of travel
Till you gave it home
