Grapefruit moon, one star shining, shining down on me
I heard that tune and now I'm pining, honey, can't you see
Every time I hear that melody, something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, can't turn back the tide

Never had no destination, could not get across
And you became my inspiration, oh, but what a cost
Every time I hear that melody, something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is more than I can hide

Now I'm smoking cigarettes and strive for purity
And I'll slip just like the stars into obscurity
Every time I hear that melody, it puts me up a tree
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is all that I can see
