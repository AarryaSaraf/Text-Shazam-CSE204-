I've heard enough from pundits
I've heard our leaders speak
I tell you know I'd rather talk
To the people in the street
'Cause you don't know someone
Until you've looked them in the eye
And that gave me a purpose
And every reason why

I drove myself across America
From Sea to shining Sea
From the Rocky coast of Maine
To the mighty redwood trees
From the plains of North Dakota
To the Gulf of Mexico
It's good to know
That hope's alive again
Across America

I spoke to folks in New Orleans
With hammers in their hands
There's a waitress in Missouri
Who wants her own health plan
And to the workers up in Michigan
In all the auto plants
They're the working men and women
Saying "Yes, we can"

Your checks and stocks and banks
Can't take our hope away
You can't foreclose on hope
Nobody has to pay

I drove myself across America
From Sea to shining Sea
From the Rocky coast of Maine
To the mighty redwood trees
From the plains of North Dakota
To the Gulf of Mexico
It's good to know
That hope's alive again
Across America
