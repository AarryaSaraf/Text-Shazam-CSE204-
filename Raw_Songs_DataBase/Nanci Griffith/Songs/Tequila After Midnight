Tequila after midnight
Drives loneliness away
Makes strangers all around you look familiar
And tequila after midnight
Makes you feel so warm
Makes you think you feel good when you don't

It's the same sad familiar story
Nothing about it's new
Just about someone who loved and lost
And it still hurt through and through

They say it drives you crazy
Well I can hardly care
For quite some time now
That's just where I've been
And they say tequila kills you
If you drink too much
Lord, I hope they make tequila long enough

It's the same sad familiar story
Nothing about it's new
Just about someone who loved and lost
And it still hurt through and through

They say it drives you crazy
Well I can hardly care
For quite some time now
That's just where I've been
And they say tequila kills you
If you drink too much
Lord, I hope they make tequila long enough
