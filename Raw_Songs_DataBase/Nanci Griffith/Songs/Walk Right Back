I want you to tell me why you walked out on me
I'm so lonesome everyday
I want you to know that since you walked out on me
Nothing seems to be the same old way
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you
The good times we had before you went away, oh me

Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me, don't send it
I'm so lonesome every day

These eyes of mine that gave you loving glances once before
Changed to shades of cloudy gray
I want so very much to see you just like before
I've got to know you're comin' back to stay
Please believe me when I say it's great to hear from you
But there's a lot of things a letter just can't say, oh me

Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me, don't send it
I'm so lonesome every day

I'm so lonesome everyday
I'm so lonesome everyday
I'm so lonesome everyday
