We all said you'd never make it
'Cause you had that fragile heart
And you were odd within the ways of the social
You through a caution to us all
And now when the late night drinkers gather for their falls
Someone says they've seen you out there laughing at us all

You mourned the cause of discontent with those who couldn't lose the dark
From the broad of daylight to half spent stars just waiting dusk to fall
Tell me, what the hell were you saying?
Was there a point at to it all?
Oh, and did they really see you out there laughing at us all

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Oh, were you really out there laughing at us all?

The midnight boy from Minnesota shut you down and stole the show
They say that you bitter in your anguish
'Cause it was you they ought to hold
You wore your causes on your sleeve like a beacon wears the dark
It's only right you should be out there laughing at us all

Now you are only dust for art
You're a shadow to recall
For all those late night drinkers in their ragged lonely bars
And we all said you'd never make it 'cause you had that fragile heart
Now, all our hearts you held are wasted
You're out there laughing at us all
