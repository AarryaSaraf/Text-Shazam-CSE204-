Wash away the tears, all the angry times we shared
All the feelings and the sorrows come and gone
We have left them slip away, because I'm standing here today
And I'm smiling at your old west Texas sun

I remember times when you'd weathered out my mind
But you always had a peaceful word to say
And you could bring always bring a smile with the mischief in your eyes
Still, I'm glad the miles kept me separate from your games

You know you're still as wild as those old Texas plains
Standing by the highway, do you still call my name?
Lord, I can't believe it's been such a long, long time
Since I've seen that Texas boy smile

Well, I'll be heading out of town, I may stop by next time around
Hell, it's raining, but at least that's something real
I came shackled down with fears about our dreams and wasted years
And now I know exactly how to feel

Wash away the tears, all the angry times we shared
All the feelings and the sorrows come and gone
We have let them slip away, because I'm standing here today
Smiling at your old west Texas sun
