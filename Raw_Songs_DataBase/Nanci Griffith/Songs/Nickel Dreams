A little girl dreamer
Ribbons and long curls
Reflections of yesterdays past
Headlines and footlights
Wee hours and long nights
Keep everything moving so fast

It's taken a long time
And she's walked a fine line
For fortune and fame have arrived
She kept on striving
And half-way surviving
Till part of those dreams came alive

Now she wishes she looked like they tell her she looks all the time
What she'd give just to feel like she tells them she's feelin' just fine
All that money she makes every night ain't as much as it seems
'Cause it's a dollar a wrinkle and less than a nickel a dream

Well, her heart may be breaking
But she keeps on taking what she thought she wanted back then
It's too late to change her
There's always a stranger to tell her she's someone again

Now she wishes she looked like they tell her she looks all the time
What she'd give just to feel like she tells them she's feelin' just fine
All that money she makes every night ain't as much as it seems
'Cause it's a dollar a wrinkle and less than a nickel a dream
