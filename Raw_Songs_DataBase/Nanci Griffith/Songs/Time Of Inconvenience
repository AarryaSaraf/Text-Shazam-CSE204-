Time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time

We're living in a time of inconvenience
Compassion fails me with this meaness in the air
City streets are filled with violence
So we close our doors to the city
And pretend that it's not there
Here I go again
Back out on these mean streets
The evil seems to cling to the soles of my feet
Because I'm living in a time of inconvenience
At an inconvenient time

We're living in the age of communication
Where the only voices heard have money in their hands
Where greed has become a sophistication
And if you ain't got money
You ain't got nothin' in this land
But, here I am one lonely woman
On these mean streets
Where the right to life man has become my enemy
'Cause I'm living in his time of inconvenience
At an inconvenient time

And I've turned my cheek
As my history fades
While the clock ticks away
Any progress we've made
I never thought
I'd be ashamed to be human
Afraid to say
My time has seen its day
Because I'm living in a time of inconvenience
Living in a time of inconvenience
Living in a time of inconvenience
In an inconvenient time

This is a time of greed and power
Where everyone needs to have someone to shove around
Our children come to us for answers
Listening for freedom but they don't know the sound
And there they are, our children
Dumped out in these mean streets
The evil sweeps them up
And brings them to their knees
Because they're living in our time of inconvenience
They're living in the age of communication
This is a time of greed and power
This is a time that I wish was not mine
Because it's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
