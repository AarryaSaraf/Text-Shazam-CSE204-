I've been walkin' in my sleep
Countin' troubles 'stead of countin' sheep
Where the years went I can't say
I just turned around and they've gone away

I've been siftin' through the layers
Of dusty books and faded papers
That tell a story I used to know
It was one that happened so long ago

It's gone away in yesterday
Now I find myself on a moutainside
Where the rivers change direction
Across the Great Divide

Well, I heard the owl callin'
Softly as the night was fallin'
With a question, and I replied
But he's gone across the borderline

He's gone away in yesterday
Now I find myself on a moutainside
Where the rivers change direction
Across the Great Divide

The finest hour that I have seen
Is the one that comes between
The edge of night and the break of day
It's when the darkness rolls away

It's gone away in yesterday
Now I find myself on a moutainside
Where the rivers change direction
Across the Great Divide

It's gone away in yesterday
Now I find myself on a moutainside
Where the rivers change direction
Across the Great Divide
