You pace the pool and talk about it
I read my book and think about it
You've walked on water as I'm turning the page
You say, "What's the intrigue here in reading when the sky is clear?"
You are in the sun and I am always in the shade

It's too late to leave you
You know that I will never leave you
It's too late to know you
You don't like to be known
You would never hold me
I don't like to be held
I will always love you
In spite of myself

I can feel the weather changing
The leaves are tired and turned with anger
They fall around us like a veil of tears
You have never needed me and I'm not good at being needed
This season will be leaving us but we will still be here

Do you miss me when I'm far away
Do you save me for your rainy days?
Is my picture on the mantle or is it in the fire?
It's odd the way the years fly by they leave us standing side by side
You have been my mystery and I've been your desire
