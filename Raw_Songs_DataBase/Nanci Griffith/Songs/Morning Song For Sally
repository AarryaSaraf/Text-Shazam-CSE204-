As the morning light stretched in across my bed
I thought of you
Remembering your laughing eyes and all we said
I love you too
As all my thoughts of you pass 'fore my face a thousand times
The way they race my heart I cannot say it all in lines

How the short time together lasts so long
Makes me strong
As two weeks came and went then you and I were gone
Living on
For it seems our love was destined to be caught in other nets
But the love we held so brief I'd chance again without regret

Yes, standing by the road has been my song before
Much too long
But now somehow I'm forced to see me there once more
And that's the song
For my waking thoughts of you are but extensions of the dream
Without you here beside me
I'll never know all that they mean
...
