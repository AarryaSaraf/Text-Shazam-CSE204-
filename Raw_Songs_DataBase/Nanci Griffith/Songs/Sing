I heard the music long ago
Songs that rent the air
Fading in and out at night
While I was lying there
Voices soft and lonely
And later Rock and Roll
Flying across the Rio Grande
Straight into my soul

Trying to find a reason
Trying to find that rhyme
Rolling with the river
Trying to keep time
And in the end I wouldn't change a thing
I'd sing

Music is the life in me
It's the melody I breathe
It gives me strength in harder times
And reason to believe
Endless miles of highway
Every step hard earned
It seems it was all mapped out
All the twists and turns

Still trying to find a reason
Trying to find that rhyme
Still rolling with the river
Trying to keep time
And in the end I wouldn't change a thing
I'd sing
