As quiet as a street lamp
This is some kinda town
Whiskey go easy
When the sun goes down
My best to the midnight
God, look at the moon
There's enough for two shadows
There's only one in the room
There's only one in the room

There's a storm out on the water
Oh, bless the ships at sea
There's a storm down in my lover's heart
Oh, God bless me

I wanna be blown by the wind of his
Breathing
Shown by lightening flashing
Oh, I've never been afraid of the thunder
I wonder
Will he rain on me?
Is loneliness contagious?
Another damn song about a waitress
It's the only hotel here
And the engine's gotta cool
I'm a bad hand at solitaire
You lie to yourself and no one cares
While the wall paper fades
The sun takes the moon
There should be two to a room

There's a storm out on the water
Oh, bless the ships at sea
There's a storm down in my lover's heart
Oh, God bless me
