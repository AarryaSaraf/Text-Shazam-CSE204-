I wish that you loved me
The way that I love you
I wish I had Angels
Who sang in my dreams
If wishes were changes
We'd all live in roses
And there wouldn't be children
Who cried in their sleep

He wishes I loved him
The way that I love you
If wishes were changes
I'd dry all his tears
If wishes were changes
I'd make him my anchor
He'd be my anchor
He'd be my Angel
Who sang through the years

So long to the blue days of wishing
If wishes were changes
There'd be no goodbyes
So long to the heart I have given
'Cause wishing won't bring back
The love in your eyes

I wish that I had your
Wings of desire
I wish I had seen you
As I see you now
I wouldn't feel sorrow
You've left here inside me
But, wishing won't change
Right from wrong for you now
...
