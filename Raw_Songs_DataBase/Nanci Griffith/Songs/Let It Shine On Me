There's a star in heaven's sky
Always shining bright
It's just a tear in an angel's eye
A gentle guiding light

Let it shine on me
Let it show the way
Let it always be
Let it always stay
Let it flood my soul
Let it hold the key
Let it all unfold
Let it shine on me

When the way seems so dark
Let it shine on me
Bringing home within my heart
A reason to believe

Let it shine on me
Let it show the way
Let it always be
Let it always stay
Let it flood my soul
Let it hold the key
Let it all unfold
Let it shine on me

Let it shine on me
Let it show the way
Let it always be
Let it always stay
Let it flood my soul
Let it hold the key
Let it all unfold
Let it shine on me
