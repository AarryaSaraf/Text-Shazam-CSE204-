I found your letter in my mailbox today
You were just checkin' if I was okay
And if I miss you, well, you know what they say

Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon
No need to tell me, you'd like to be friends
And help me get back on my feet again
If I miss you at all, it's just now and then

Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon
There's a blue moon shinin'
When I am reminded of all we've been through
Such a blue moon shinin'
Does it ever shine down on you?
You act as if it never hurt you at all
Like I'm the only one who's gettin' up from a fall
Don't you remember?
Can't you recall?

Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon
Just once in a very blue moon
