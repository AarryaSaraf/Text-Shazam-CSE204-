Saint Teresa, your patron child's come home
Were you there to greet her?
Did your angels know her songs?
And all her sorrows
Did you lift them from her brow?
Did you kiss her hand that took her soul
Back up to you
Our Patron saint of harmony and vow

Help me in this stillness
Tell me things I need to know
How we loved your patron child
We say, so long and so long ago
Saint Teresa
Can you speak to me at all
Ah, from here where will we go?
Saint Teresa

Saint Teresa, she was our sister of arms
Gone now the trio
To Our Lady, Kate and John
And fare to fare
Of the tears that cannot fall
We send this melody please help her sing along
Back up to you
Our Patron saint of harmony and song

Back up to her Patron saint
Beyond our wood those lights
Saint Teresa of Avila
Discalced de Carmelites
Back up to her Patron saint
Beyond our wood those lights
Saint Teresa of Avila
Discalced de Carmelites
Saint Cecilia to Saint Teresa
"Your patron child is home"
(There are lights beyond our woods)

Saint Teresa of Avila
Discalced de Carmelites
