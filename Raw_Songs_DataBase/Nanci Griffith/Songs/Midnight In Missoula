Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Where the Black Hills know your name
Is the snow piled high around your window frame?
Is there enough frost left to write our names upon the pane?

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula

I am down in Rio where I cannot find the sky
Our savior on that mountaintop has taught my soul to fly
I am singing Gershwin and children's lullabies
And wondering of you
And if you're sleeping in Missoula tonight?

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula

I'd love to climb your hilltop and look out upon Missoula lights
Sing Samuel Barber melodies with your viola sweet and high
But I am off to Liverpool on an early evening flight
And wondering of you
And if you're sleeping in Missoula tonight

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Where the Black Hills know your name
Is the snow piled high around your window frame?
Is there enough frost left to write our names upon the pane?

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula

Are you sleeping now?
Do you know how much I love ya?
Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
