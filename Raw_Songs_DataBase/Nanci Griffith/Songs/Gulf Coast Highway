Gulf Coast Highway, he worked the rails
He worked the rice fields with their cool dark wells
He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico
The only thing we've ever owned is this old house here by the road

And when he dies, he says, he'll catch some blackbird's wing
And he will fly away to Heaven, come some sweet bluebonnet spring

She walked through springtime when I was home
The days were sweet, the nights were warm
The seasons changed, the jobs would come the flowers fade
This old house felt so alone when the work took me away

And when she dies, she says, she'll catch some blackbird's wing
And she will fly away to Heaven, come some sweet bluebonnet spring

Highway 90, the jobs are gone
We tend our garden, we set the sun
This is the only place on earth bluebonnets grow
Once a year they come and go at this old house here by the road

And when we die, we say, we'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away to heaven, come some sweet bluebonnet spring

And when we die, we say, we'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away together, come some sweet bluebonnet spring
