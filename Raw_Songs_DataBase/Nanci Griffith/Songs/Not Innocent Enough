What the hell was I doing there in that fast food parking lot?
They say I robbed the restaurant and a Memphis cop got shot
I was trying to feed my habit, I was scared and I was high
It was never my intention that anyone should die

And just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
My name is Philip Workman and I'm not innocent enough

It's not a long walk from a trailer park to a Tennessee cell block
But I got saved behind these bars, soon I'll give my soul to God
Reverend Joe is praying for me and the family left behind
They say my bullet took his life but that bullet was not mine

Oh, just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
My name is Philip Workman and I'm not innocent enough

I had no money for a lawyer to fight the system from within
There's no justice for the poor from the witness they brought in
Circumstance and random chance, I never meant to do no harm
Now that cop and I, we've both died from that needle in my arm

And there where those who called for mercy in those final days
Even the officer's daughter cried to grant me stay
But I'm not innocent enough, I'm not innocent enough
I'm not innocent enough, I'm not innocent enough

And just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
My name was Philip Workman, I was not innocent enough
