// Regret //

Maybe I've forgotten the name and the address

Of everyone I've ever known

It's nothing I regret

Save it for another day

It's the school exam and the kids have run away


I would like a place I could call my own

Have a conversation on the telephone

Wake up every day that would be a start

I would not complain of my wounded heart


I was upset you see 

Almost all the time

You used to be a stranger

Now you are mine


I wouldn't even trust you

I've not got much to give

We're dealing in the limits

And we don't know who with

You may think that I'm out of hand

That I'm naive, I'll understand

On this occasion, it's not true 

Look at me, I'm not you


I would like a place I could call my own

Have a conversation on the telephone

Wake up every day that would be a start

I would not complain of my wounded heart


I was a short fuse 

Burning all the time

You were a complete stranger

Now you are mine


I would like a place I could call my own

Have a conversation on the telephone

Wake up every day that would be a start

I would not complain about my wounded heart


Just wait till tomorrow

I guess that's what they all say 

Just before they fall apart

// World //

I turn sideways to the sun 

keep my thoughts from everyone

It's a jungle, I'm a freak

Hear me talk, but never speak


So I'm stepping out of time

because breaking is a crime

And it may all be too late

but I've no passion for this hate


That's the price of love (that's the price of love) 

Can you feel it (can you feel it)

If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)

how long would it last (that's the price of love)


And when this building is on fire

these flames can't burn any higher

I turn sideways to the sun

and in a moment I am gone


That's the price of love (that's the price of love) 

Can you feel it (can you feel it)

If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)

how long would it last (that's the price of love)


That's the price of love (that's the price of love) 

Can you feel it (can you feel it)

If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)

How long would it last (that's the price of love)

// Ruined In A Day //

Listen

I may be wrong but you're missing

There's something wrong you could say

Ruined in a day

You could be the lover of jade

Forever on your own in the shade

Let's do it anyway


Some people like to deceive you

While others may feel that they need you

While I do the best that I can

Keeping my life in my hands


And if you feel

Your cradle rocking

Then take the wheel

Don't let me stop you

(Hang around for awhile)

But stop acting like a child

Every step we take is the one

That's gonna undo what you've done

It could take all day


Some people like to deceive you

While others may feel that they need you

But I do the best that I can

I keep my world in my hands


Some people like to deceive you

while others may feel that they need you

But I do the best that I can

keeping my world in my hands

// Spooky //

Once in a while I need a friend

So why won't you let me recover

It's just a moment in your life

But sometimes we divide each other


Maybe we could find a time

Eliminate what's on your mind

We'd do everything we could

Our presence in the neighbourhood


We could break every rule 

Anytime we wanted to

Don't be afraid to live this way

Lets defend the things we say


I want to be up in the air

I could be anywhere

Tell me I'm wrong, at least till tomorrow

Set me free and I will follow


Maybe we could find a time

To elevate what's on your mind

Recreate for me and you

A master plan just for two


We could break every rule 

Anytime we wanted to

Don't be afraid to live this way

Lets defend the things we say


Elevate what's on your mind

Eliminate what's on your mind

// Everyone Everywhere //

At the end of the day
There's no food on our plate
So we beg and we steal
For we know love is real
And if we don't take a chance
In a spare sideways glance
These are all the chains I wanted
To justify the things I do

And when we kiss we speak as one
And in a single breath this world is gone
And when we kiss we speak as one
With a single breath this world is gone

It's a crisis I know
At the end of the show
People change but we don't falter
'Cause we know love is real
This is no place to shiver
So get up off the grass
You were once the main attraction
But all that's in the past

How much is free for me and you
I'm on my knees, I am a fool
But when we kiss we speak as one
With a single breath this world is gone (this world is gone)

How could I fail to give her
When she cried such a lot?
People change but we don't falter
'Cause we use what we've got

And when we kiss we speak as one
With a single breath this world is gone
And when we kiss we speak as one
With a single breath this world is gone

This world is gone
This world is gone
This world is gone

// Young Offender //

Pictures of an image of a person who could not be blamed

You are a colour and you are a number

We need a sanction to see one another

If I keep my distance in the season of this slender hell

It's because of the need to live off one another

Go home young offender and stay undercover


We're busy running out of time

(Whatever it takes, I will make you mine)

I'll take the future from your hands

(All the things I've ever had, I can make the perfect crime)


We're strong, we do our thing

Let the world cry, watch the birds sing

Give me the freedom, I need to recover

Words cannot heal, when a line is your lover


Wind howls in my chamber like an angel

(like an angel)

You are a colour and you are a number

Go home young offender and stay undercover

// Liar //

I haven't time to sympathise

With all this nonsense and your lies

You are the king of nothing

But you shall hold me

You've got your finger on the pulse

And in my pocket, yes of course

I am the voice of treason

But you betrayed me


I used up nearly all my luck

I didn't have to try

But yesterday is gone

And now I need an alibi

If this gets any stranger things are gonna change

Cause I can't stand the music, always lying

If that's what it takes I'll do it (I'll do it)

I'll keep on right on through it (on through it)


So please believe me when I say

I wouldn't give the time of day

Because then I'd be faking

When I could tell the truth

Were you abandoned in your youth

Because if not, you will be soon

I'm growing tired of waiting

For you to say goodbye

// Chemical //

Any kind of fool with the will to live

Tries to get it right with the one they're with

But even though I give you special treatment

You keep getting high juvenile delinquent


And this is how it feels to be

On the payroll company

Your every scene is in the round

And all the men are falling down


Constantly harrassed and misunderstood

I'm the 'lost and found' of the neighbourhood

And I am not a part of society

So don't get off the ground just be with me


And this is how it feels to be

On the payroll company

Your every scene is in the round

And all the men are falling down


I would brave the rainstorm in my car

Maybe you can leave but you won't get far

It wasn't just a dream it was much too good

Just another day in the brotherhood


And this is how it feels to be

On the payroll company

Your every scene is in the round

And all the men are falling down


And this is how it feels to be

On the payroll company

Your every scene is in the round

We don't need to hang around

// Times Change //

In a manger like Christ I lay

Yellow fever, yellow hay

Feel the rhythm, sweetest sound

Making, breaking sacred ground

I'd give you a piece of my love for free 

But whatever I say you'll never see

Acquire a taste for a different sound

Make or break it this side of town


Life will never be the same

In Port-Royal town, I hear it coming

The shaking of the ground

They're stealing in the day

In Port-Royal town, the children are running


Ever strange the lives we lead

So detached from the things we need

Signs of greed in everyone

Instant eviction and the blood on a gun

Just when you think you've found it

Spinning world I want to spin around it

What is wrong? This pain won't peel

The fibres of my life won't heal

// Special //

It isn't what it used to be

I wake up every night

On the stairs

Waiting for the dawn to come

Every drop of wine

You can be my time

Only tomorrow knows

Why do we beg when we can borrow

This time we knew

No more or less

There's nothing left


It was always special

It was like water down the drain

I'm intoxicated

Every time I hear your name

I try to remember

But nothing is the same


It wasn't that I didn't try

It's not the kind of thing, that you buy

Written in my destiny

Life is but a dream

Covered by the sky

Stop saying that you're calling time

Look at your life before you start on mine

I'm not the kind of person that you need

I'm sick of trying

I mean that it's over


It was always special 

It was like water down the drain

I'm intoxicated

Every time I hear your name

I try to remember

But nothing is the same

It was always special

it was like water down the drain


Patiently you wait for me

You're so blind

I thought it couldn't be

Then changed my mind

Drowning in the endless sea

Line all those lines

The traces of your memory

Don't belong with mine
