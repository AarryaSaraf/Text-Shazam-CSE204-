// Age Of Consent //

Won't you please let me go

These words lie inside they hurt me so

And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you

Just what I want to do

I'm not the kind that needs to tell you

Just what you want me to


I saw you this morning

I thought that you might like to know

I received your message in full a few days ago

I understood every word that it said

And now that I've actually heard it

You're going to regret


And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you

Just what you want me to

You're not the kind that needs to tell me

About the birds and the bees


Do you find this happens all the time

Crucial point one day becomes a crime

And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you

Just what I want to do

I'm not the kind that needs to tell you


I've lost you [x5]

I've lost you [x5]

I've lost you [x5]

// We All Stand //

Three miles to go

Three miles to go

At the end of the road

There's a soldier waiting for me


I've got three miles to go

Three miles to go

At the end of the road

There's a soldier waiting for me


At the end of the road

At the end of the road

At the end of the road


Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy     

Forever to be still

Breath held tight inside of me

Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy      

Forever to be still

Breath held tight inside of me

Life goes on and on...


It's a red sky tonight

It's a red sky tonight

At the end of the road

Where all futures go

At the end of the road

There's a soldier waiting for me

He's got three miles to go

Three miles to go

At the end of the road

At the end of the road

There's blood on shore


Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy 

Forever to be still

Breath held tight inside of me

Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy   

Forever to be still

Breath held tight inside of me

// The Village //

When a new life turns towards you

And the night becomes a bay

We shall remain forever

Everyone who meets his way

Oh, our love is like the flowers

The rain and the sea and the hours

Oh, our love is like the flowers

The rain and the sea and the hours


When the rain falls to the sea

They'll be waiting for you and for me     

And the sky reflects our image

Trying to sleep right through our lives


Oh, our love is like the earth

The sun and the trees and the birth

Oh, our love is like the earth

The sun and the trees and the birth


I am still here two days later

Same place, same time

And I'm stuck here two years too long

Same place, the wrong time


Oh, our love is like the flowers

The rain and the sea and the hours

Oh, our love is like the flowers

The sun and the sea and the hours


Their love died three years ago

Spoken words I cannot show

// 5.8.6. //

I see danger

On the corner sent by me

Shadows the ways

Straight away you ran from me

I heard you calling

Yes, I heard you calling

I heard you calling

Yes, I heard you calling


I hear silence

I hear silence in my heart (house)

From a distance

Turn your back and run (hide) from me

Heard you calling

Yes, I heard you calling

Heard you calling

Yes, I heard you calling


When it happens

You will be no friend of mine

Take the first chance

When I am no longer free

Heard you calling

Yes, I heard you calling

Heard you calling

Yes, I heard you calling


In the future

When you want me in your heart

I won't be there (help you)

If you call out in the dark

Heard you calling

Yes, I heard you calling

Heard you calling

Oh yes I heard you, heard you, heard you, heard you calling


Can you hear me deep inside

From these feelings I can't hide

Can you hear me deep inside

From these feelings I can't hide

Oh, can you hear me deep inside

From these feelings i can't hide

Can you hear me calling you

Can you hear me calling you

Can you hear me calling you

Can you head me calling you

// Your Silent Face //

A thought that never changes

Remains a stupid lie

It's never been quite the same

No hearing or breathing

No movement, no colors

Just silence


Rise and fall of shame

A search that shall remain

We asked you what you'd seen

You said you didn't care


Sound formed in a vacuum 

May seem a waste of time 

It's always been just the same

No hearing or breathing

No movement no lyrics

Just nothing


The sign that leads the way

The path we can not take

You've caught me at a bad time

So why don't you piss off

// Ultraviolence //

Who saw those dark eyes

Who saw those dark eyes

These years gone by

Deep within

Burn my skin

All those years gone by

In the heat of the night

All those years gone by


Who felt those cold hands

Who felt those cold hands

Touch my skin

Deep within

Burn my soul

Fell to the ground

Where I was found

All those years ago

All those tears ago

All those years ago


Everybody makes mistakes

Everybody makes mistakes

Even me

Just be free

This is a place

Where in the end

It happens in

Our world within


Time to go

Time to go

// Leave Me Alone //

On a thousand islands in the sea

I see a thousand people just like me

A hundred unions in the snow

I watch them walking, falling in a row

We live always underground

It's going to be so quiet in here tonight

A thousand islands in the sea

It's a shame


And a hundred years ago

A sailor trod this ground I stood upon   

Take me away everyone

When it hurts thou


From my head to my toes

From the words in the book

I see a vision that would bring me luck

From my head to my toes

To my teeth, through my nose

You get these words wrong

You get these words wrong

Everytime

You get these words wrong

I just smile


But from my head to my toes

From my knees to my eyes

Everytime I watch the sky

For these last few days leave me alone

But for these last few days leave me alone

Leave me alone

Leave me alone
