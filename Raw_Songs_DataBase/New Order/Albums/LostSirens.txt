// I Told You So //

It's been ten long years since I've been home
I've been waiting here with nowhere to go
It's an occupation I don't like
But it pays the rent and turns on the light

I told you so, it has to be
Cut loose and runaway with me
We'll go out every night, I'll be there by your side
And we'll all get high down the old west side

If it ain't the job and it ain't the place
But I must stay for your pretty face
It's a bad reaction I can't fix
You conned me with those feline tricks

And I told you so, it's a crazy world
For a mixed-up guy and a no-good girl
And I told you so, it's a crazy world
For a mixed-up guy with a no-good girl

Take her, take the world

I told you so, it has to be
Cut loose and run away with me
(Run away)
We'll go out every night, I'll be there by your side
And we'll all get high down the old west side

Down the old west side
Down the old west side
Down the old west side
(Take the world, yeah)

// I'll Stay With You //

[Verse:]
Hey, you, what is the matter?
Tell me the truth, I won't laugh at you.
Where these words grew?
Were they unkind?
That guy's a fool, he's crossed the line.

[Chorus:]
I'll stay with you
Till hell freezes over.
We're at to each other
Like sister and brother.
You're one of a kind,
High on my agenda,
Oh, I'll change your mind,
When will you surrender?

[Verse:]
We never left in,
Your world felt unharmed
It cut like a blade
Right through your heart.
And where your friends
Just when you needed them?
They were not there,
Why did you believe in them?

[Chorus:]
I'll stay with you
Till hell freezes over.
We're at to each other
Like sister and brother.
You're one of a kind,
High on my agenda,
Oh, I'll change your mind,
When will you surrender?

[Chorus:]
I'll stay with you
Till hell freezes over.
We're at to each other
Like sister and brother.
You're one of a kind,
High on my agenda,
Oh, I'll change your mind,
When will you surrender?
When will you surrender?

// Sugarcane //

[Verse:]
From my head to my toes
I can hardly believe the things that I read are not
That it's hard, fly it in your plane and drive it in your car
You're a superstar, yes you are,
Signing autographs, making people laugh
You'll go far, clever boy,
Girls just wanna be with you, lawyers wanna deal with you.

[Chorus:]
Why don't you wake up
And stop what you're doing right now?
You've gotta be true.
You know you don't live forever
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.
Wake up right now, stop what you're doing,
You've gotta be true,
You know you don't live forever,
Hey, man, you've gotta be right.

[Verse:]
Write a book about your life,
I can hardly believe the things that you need at home
With your wife, you treat it like a game, but this made you pretty fame
With perfect hair and your clothes,
It's just another day in a life of a superstar.
It's gotta be the way, it's the same, no matter who you are.

[Chorus:]
Why don't you wake up
And stop what you're doing right now?
You've gotta be true.
You know you don't live forever
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.
Wake up right now, stop what you're doing,
You've gotta be true,
You know you don't live forever,
Hey, man, you've gotta be right.

[Bridge:]
Take care over what you do,
You gotta take care of what you are.
You gotta take care of what you're not,
You gotta take care of what you've got.

[Chorus:]
Why don't you wake up
And stop what you're doing right now?
You've gotta be true.
You know you don't live forever
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.
Wake up right now, stop what you're doing,
You've gotta be true,
You know you don't live forever,
Hey, man, you've gotta be right.

It's just another day in a life of a superstar.
It's gotta be the way, it's the same, no matter who you are.
It's just another day in a life of a superstar.
It's gotta be the way, it's the same, no matter who you are.

// Recoil //

You've got a strange look in your eyes
Nothing to get and no need to lie.
And when the dust come howl at your door
You're not afraid, it's just the role.

It's not the way that I want to be
But I can't explain just how I feel.
Out of my heart and into my soul
You were the start and you are the go.

But it isn't funny the way that you talk about me
You know I can't change the way that you want me to be.
But I tried to do what I can, gone is the life we built in a sec.

// Californian Grass //

[Verse:]
My cold heart needs some company
Shine a light in there, maybe I can see
Wild hostiles on an open frame
Sun shining when it could be rain.

[Chorus:]
Give me all that I ask, some Californian grass
Bring it over to me, I want everything that I see.
We can stop at a grocery store,
Buy a thing for a few dollars more.

[Verse:]
My hand, it shakes, my pulse is high.
And my complications I can't describe.
Cause your cold heart will break one day
So don't you throw this chance away.

[Chorus]
Give me all that I ask, some Californian grass
Bring it over to me, I want everything that I see.
We can stop at a grocery store,
Buy a thing for a few dollars more.

Sun shining when it could be rain.

// Hellbent //

Old friend, what you doin' out there?
Come inside, sit yourself on that chair
Its been a long time, since the last time
And many burdens have passed through our hands
Night into today and day in to night

Do you know what I mean? I'm trying to say I'm sorry
You're the star in the scene, you're not just anybody
There's a light in your eye that I can't seem to reach
Over head, in the sky,
Is it shining on me? Is it shining on me?

I've always knew, that you would not hang around
You and me were like the thieves of the town
Too many girlfriends, but not enough love
Too many late nights, and not enough sleep
Strung out and wasted, no good and shameful
The life we tasted, there on the table

Do you know what I mean? I'm trying to say I'm sorry
You're the star in the scene, you're not just anybody
There's a light in your eye that I can't seem to reach
Over head, in the sky,
Is it shining on me? Is it shining on me?
We have hope in our heart, and dreams in our head,
But most of the time, we stayed in our bed
If you go out there, you just want more,
It's a cold, cold world, outside that door.

// Shake It Up //

[Verse:]
You get up in the early morning,
You never seen a feel like you wanna.
Look up and the sky is falling,
It's just another day, call tomorrow.

[Chorus:]
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up, yeah,
You can make it real if you want it.
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up, yeah,
You can turn the wheel if you want it.
I loved you like you were no other,
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up.
I read your book from front to cover,
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up.

[Verse:]
There's a little feel like your own life,
Watch you on TV like you're standing on the front line
And the papers say that the later
Does it have a feel like it's real, like it's true?
Does it have a feel like your own life
Watch you on TV like you're standing on the front line
And the papers saying that the later
Does it have a feel like it's real, like it's true?
Does it have a?

[Bridge:]
Do you need it? Do you want it?
We'll rock you on that, we don't wanna wait.
Would you spend some money on it?
Well, I don't like the sound and I can't afford the late.

[Chorus:]
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up, yeah,
You can make a deal if you want it.
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up, yeah,
You just gotta do what you've gotta.
I read you off from front to cover,
You came up on me like a piece of cake.
Still we chose to love each other
There's no cure like the ones hit.

Does it have a feel like your own life
Watch you on TV like you're standing on the front line
And the papers saying that the later
Does it have a feel like it's real, like it's true?
Does it have a?
Does it have a feel like your own life
Watch you on TV like you're standing on the front line
And the papers saying that the later
Does it have a feel like it's real, like it's true?
Does it have a?

Does it have a feel like your own life
Watch you on TV like you're standing on the front line
And the papers saying that the later
Does it have a feel like it's real, like it's true?
Does it have a?

// I've Got A Feeling //

[Verse:]
I don't wanna be on my own,
I can't get no sleep,
Things keep going wrong.
But the words inside my head,
They don't tell no lies,
We're hanging by a thread,
But still we gotta try.

Driving down the road,
Street lights flashing by me,
I just gonna go, leave this world behind me.
I want to be free, to do what I do best,
I just gotta run, can't afford to rest.

[Chorus:]
Something ain't right, I've got a feeling
Don't ask me why, but I've gotta leave here.
What can I do? Cause something it's changed,
I'm telling you, you're not the same.

[Verse:]
Rain is falling down on my screen
Headlights on the road filling into scene.
But still my empty heart beats another day
I don't know where to start, I don't know what to say,
It's tearing me apart.

And all the time we had, there's no use looking back,
It only makes you sad, we've trimmed enough the track.
I'd say it to your face if you were here with me,
I'd put you in your place, cause you're not good for me.

[Chorus:]
Something ain't right, I've got a feeling
Don't ask me why, but I've gotta leave here.
What can I do? Cause something it's changed,
I'm telling you, you're not the same.
There wasn't a day that I wasn't true,
You were the one that I thought I knew.

[Bridge:]
You can't hurt me and you can't hold me
Why can't you see that you don't own me?

What can I do, something it's changed
I'm telling you that you're not the same.
People may come and people may go,
But yours was the love I've got to know.
