// Be A Rebel //

I feel you near, for harmony
And I look around, but it's not what I see
I see angry faces looking at me
And I want to know what makes them so
For this world can be a dangerous place
But it's all we got and it's quite a lot

Take a look at yourself
You may not be the same as everyone else
You're just different, that's ok
We all follow our own way
And if you find that they won't listen
Then they've got nothing to say
So don't get mad, don't feel sad
Be a rebel, not a devil
(Be a rebel, not a devil)

There will come a day
When your fear and self-doubt fades away
Because you have achieved what you need
There's no doubt in your heart
Not a care, it's a family affair

Take a look at yourself
You may not be the same as everyone else
You're just different, that's ok
We all follow our own way
And if you find that they won't listen
Then they've got nothing to say
So don't get mad, don't feel sad
Be a rebel, not a devil

// Decades //

Here are the young men, the weight on their shoulders
Here are the young men, where have they been?
We knocked on the door of Hell's darker chamber
Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in
Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying
We saw ourselves now as we never had seen
Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration
The sorrows we suffered and never were free

Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?

Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever
Can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase
Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings
Open then shut, then slammed in our face

Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?

// Disorder //

I've been waiting for a guide to come out and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel the pleasure of a normal man?
These sensations barely interest me for another day
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away

It's getting faster now, moving faster now, it's getting out of hands
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, it's a no man's land
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now
I've got the spirit, lose the feelings, let it out somehow

What means to you, what means to me, and we will meet again
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from your friends
Who is right, who can tell, and who gives a damn right now
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know

I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling

// Heart & Soul //

Instincts that can still betray us
A journey that leads to the sun
Soulless and bent on destruction
A struggle between right and wrong
You take my place in the showdown
I'll observe with a pitiful eye
I'd humbly ask for forgiveness
A request well beyond you and I

Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

An abyss that laughs at creation
A circus complete with all fools
Foundations that lasted the ages
Then ripped apart at their roots
Beyond all this good is the terror
The grip of a mercenary hand
When savagery turns all good reason
There's no turning back, no last stand

Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

Existence well what does it matter?
I exist on the best terms I can
The past is now part of my future
The present is well out of hand
The present is well out of hand

Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn
One will burn, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

// Here To Stay //

Who is this man
That follows me
This blue eyed boy
Who wants to be
This worthy cause
Of human kind
This pawn set up by time

Like a bright light on the horizon
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying
He'll drive you away, he'll drive you insane
But then he'll remove all of your pain
Like a bright light on the horizon
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying
He'll get you flying, he'll get you flying
He'll get you flying, flying, flying

This open book
Yet to be read
This second look
This leap ahead
The hope I held inside
With you, was kept alive

Like a bright light on the horizon
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying
He'll drive you away, he'll drive you insane
But then he'll remove all of your pain
Like a bright light on the horizon
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying
He'll get you flying, he'll get you flying
He'll get you flying, flying, flying

We're here to stay
We're here to stay
We're here to stay
We're here to stay
We're here to stay
We're here to stay
We're here to stay
We're here to stay

Like a bright light on the horizon
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying
He'll get you flying, he'll get you flying
He'll get you flying, flying, flying

// Love Will Tear Us Apart //

When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep? All my failings exposed
There's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Just that something so good just can't function no more

Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear it apart again
Love, love will tear it apart again

// Touched By The Hand Of God //

I was standing by the ocean when I saw your face
I couldn't look at you
I guess you knew it but I never realized
That we were through

And now I'm down here all alone
With every feeling that I own
You can't take that away

And with every breath we take
And the illusions we create
Will come to you someday

And I was touched
By the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was

I never hoped to do the things in this world
I wanted to
Because everything I own
It belongs to you

I never looked at you in a sexual way
In my life before
And I've never woken up like this
So desperately before

And I was touched
By the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was

// World In Motion //

(Well some of the crowd are on the pitch
Well some of the crowd are on the pitch, they think it's all over
Well it is now!)

Express yourself, create the space
You know you can win, don't give up the chase
Beat the man, take him on
You never give up, its one on one

(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) You can't be wrong
(Express yourself) When something's good its never gone

Loves got the world in motion and I know what we can do
Loves got the world in motion and I can't believe its true

Now is the time, let everyone see
You never give up, that's how it should be
Don't get caught, make your own play
Express yourself, don't give it away

(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) You can't be wrong
(Express yourself) When something's good its never gone

Loves got the world in motion and I know what we can do
Loves got the world in motion and I can't believe its true
Loves got the world in motion and I know what we can do
Loves got the world in motion and I can't believe its true

You've got to hold and give but do it at the right time
You can be slow or fast but you must get to the line
They'll always hit you and hurt you, defend and attack
There's only one way to beat them, get round the back
Catch me if you can cos I'm the England man
And what you're looking at is the master plan
We ain't no hooligans, this ain't no football song
Three lions on my chest, I know we can't go wrong

We're playing for England (In-ger-land)
We're playing the song
We're singing for England (In-ger-land)
Arrivederci its one on one

We're playing for England (In-ger-land)
We're playing the song
We're singing for England (In-ger-land)
Arrivederci its one on one

We're playing for England (In-ger-land)
We're playing the song
We're singing for England (In-ger-land)
Arrivederci its one on one

We're playing for England (In-ger-land)
We're playing the song
We're singing for England (In-ger-land)
Arrivederci its one on one
