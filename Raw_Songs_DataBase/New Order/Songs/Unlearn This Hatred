Heartache 

Two steps forward, and one step back
Two steps forward, and one step back

Unlearn this hatred, you got to keep it true
It's not that dated, but let's not pretend it's new
Go, you got to take it when I remember you undo this hatred
Cause I'm now a fan of you

Two steps forward, and one step back, meeting for your alternate
Make a sign that I can see, shoot into my frequency
Take me to another place, help me win this human race
Maybe it's time that you got faith, for your healing I can't wait

You're the prey and I'm the hunter, every day I think of you
I'm your automatic lover, show me what I have to do in my heart
Think is your form, and I am
And it's your fate, to make me your man

Two steps forward, and one step back, meeting for your alternate
Make a sign that I can see, shoot into my frequency
Take me to another place, help me win this human race
Maybe it's time that you got faith, for your healing I can't wait

Unlearn this hatred, you got to keep it true
It's not that dated, but let's not pretend it's new
Go, we got to take it when I remember you undo this hatred
Cause I'm now a fan of you

Two steps forward, and one step back, meeting for your alternate
Make a sign that I can see, shoot into my frequency
Take me to another place, help mew in this human race
Maybe it's time that you got faith, for your healing I can't wait
