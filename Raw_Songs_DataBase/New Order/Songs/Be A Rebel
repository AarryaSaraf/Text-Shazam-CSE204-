I feel you near, for harmony
And I look around, but it's not what I see
I see angry faces looking at me
And I want to know what makes them so
For this world can be a dangerous place
But it's all we got and it's quite a lot

Take a look at yourself
You may not be the same as everyone else
You're just different, that's ok
We all follow our own way
And if you find that they won't listen
Then they've got nothing to say
So don't get mad, don't feel sad
Be a rebel, not a devil
(Be a rebel, not a devil)

There will come a day
When your fear and self-doubt fades away
Because you have achieved what you need
There's no doubt in your heart
Not a care, it's a family affair

Take a look at yourself
You may not be the same as everyone else
You're just different, that's ok
We all follow our own way
And if you find that they won't listen
Then they've got nothing to say
So don't get mad, don't feel sad
Be a rebel, not a devil
