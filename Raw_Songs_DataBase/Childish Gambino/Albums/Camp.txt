Album: Camp

// Outside //

[Verse 1]
I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all
Hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want
Used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights
Putting on a stone face
He's saving up so we can get our own place
In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me
They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood they think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit
But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?"

[Hook]
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
We can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
No one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
We can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
No one knows

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Dad lost his job
Mama worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face
She still made dinner
"Donald watch the meter
So they don't turn the lights off"
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my Grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He's supposed to pay 'em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads under the pillow
Like that would do somethin'
But she's got six kids, she's gotta do somethin'
She don't want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad cause his father ain't around
He lookin' at me now, like
"Why you so fuckin lucky?
I had a father too
But he ain't around so I'mma take it out on you"
We used to say "I love you"
Now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you're the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over
I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are because you're young and black
Don't believe 'em
You're still that kid that kept the older boys from teasin'
For some reason

[Hook]

[Outro]
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Oh, help us Lord
Oh, baby baby baby

// Fire Fly //

[Hook:]
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I'm third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Firefly

[Verse 1:]
Skateboardin' down at Washington Square
Lookin' for quarters
Maybe afford a falafel for dinner, ugh
I'm so broke man, scholarship apologin'
Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'
Girls like, "we love you, we go to LSU
You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you"
This rap stuff is magic
I used to get called "Oreo" and "Faggot"
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
Oh you got a mixtape? That's fantastic
But everybody thought it was jokes though
They half right, the joke is
I got flow so don't act like
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be
I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he campy
I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante
Me and hip-hop, that black Sid and Nancy, let 'em know

[Hook:]
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat

And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I'm third degree, and suddenly

[Verse 2:]
It's hard to make HOV the footsteps you followin'
Especially when your niggas look like Carlton
The pretty girls usin' skin so soft
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off
Nigga you act too soft
Fuck you! I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows, cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
"Yeah so, whatcha gonna do man?
You won't speak to the hood, man"
If I was given one chance I think I could, man
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And you's a fake fuck like a fleshlight
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z?
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', "You could tear this up"
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be
Now everyone sing the chorus man, you do it so beautifully

[Hook:]
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)

// Bonfire //

OK, it's Childish Gambino, home girl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my ass crack
Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin' PETA

In Adidas with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over Es

Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like "nigga" with a hard "R"
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me

Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham

These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, Gir, Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery

Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
"You're my favorite rapper, now"
Yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin' kiss my ass, Human Centipede

You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?"
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one

It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you motherfuckers talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you motherfuckers talk about

You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an arch-villain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di

Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit: "First of all, you talk white!
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect

I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape

Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino, girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me
And I like black girls who nerdy, but when they dance they be sayin' "Owww"

I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me

I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screaming, "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
This shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony

These rappers don't know what to do
'Cause all I did was act me like a Looney Tune
And I'll give you all of me until there's nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer camp, bitch!

// All The Shine //

[Verse 1]
What the fuck do y'all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude's for real or not
I'm not trying to come hard, I'm trying to come me
That's why these older songs that I used to make I'd release free
What's the point of rap if you can't be yourself, huh?
That's why I come first like my cell phone
I'm a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it's dumb, that's the fucking reason I'm doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
'Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend's baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
See, that's not even right
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she's sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That's not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
'Cause I ain't Mumford, I ain't tryin' to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain't the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion!

[Hook]
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
"Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
"Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"

[Verse: 2]
Am I serious? I don't even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain't trying, I'm doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R's a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short-shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, "I'd get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man"
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain't Curren$y, but if there ain't money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loved to text me Psalm verses
She don't look at me like I'm the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
And I don't want them missing a son like Bone's last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I'm grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with No I.D. and no I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be

[Hook]
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
We really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
We really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
We need to find
We need to find
"Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"

// Letter Home //

You're the only girl that I have ever wanted
Every other girl is trying to be you
My mama says that I should write you letters
But I think you're with other dudes
Take my hand, you'll like it
You don't even have to call
Yes I've had some alcohol, I'm sorry
Take my hand
You don't even have to call
You're somewhere out there after all
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted

// Heartbeat //

[Hook 2x]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 1]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff tight
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you
The girl that I once had
But the sex that we have, isn't half bad
Text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'mma flirt with this new girl
And I'mma call if it don't work
So we fuck, till we come, to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
Cause

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for their first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I'm the best when I'm affectionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related, racist
I give you money, then you burn it, like you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that

But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it's fuckin' awesome

// Backpackers //

[Verse 1]
Alright it's Childish baby
Mr. Talk-about-his-dick-again
Nerdy ass black kid
Yeah whatever man I'm sick of him
That well spoken token
Who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the n-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred
Use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm dude, show respect
Something crazy, an Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine
I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with 2 fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83
Half of 'em say gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-baby's-say
I'm a problem
I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids
Not Chuck Inglish, but people who think
That hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, "What is this nigga doin rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot man he think that we feel that"
Or
"I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed
To say what all his raps are about"
You better shut your mouth
Before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics?
Or Kid Cudi's? Nigga

[Hook]
Runnin this thang
Money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name in the woods got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck a backpacker

[Verse 2]
Nigga's with OCD, N-W-O
All white like my clothes, CW shows
Nigga got signed, its an anomily
No cosine, trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
"Man, fuck you nigga...fuck you nigga!"
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the titans
Baby, your tits is titular
Listenin to some KISS FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
Super Bass, super face inside a garage
It's not a massage
Spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame
These kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He dont give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that paint back
Comin' on that mace took
I'm comin' on some real shit
I'm comin' on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick, uh

[Hook]

// L.E.S. //

Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl and uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us

A New York nine's an everywhere-else six
Timewise: the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different
Right, that's why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you
Can I have this dance?

Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl and uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us

Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl and uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us

We could pretend if you want to, like
We in love and started datin' at your art school
Cause either way we both lyin' more than half of the time
Except for when I'm home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other I'm takin' you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
Yellow-911-Persian-girl-in-the-back car
But me writin' a verse would be the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats
Watchin' lames handle they fame
They bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Anallin' anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding, stop
Girl cryin' on Ludlow
She still look good though
Love is Eastside, who are you to hate?
Movie ass, not a 10 but a Super 8
You ain't see me at the show, I was super great
Hotel penthouse, go on and let it ruminate
City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could, then I kept goin'

Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl and uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh
I hope nobody catch us

We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us

Ooh girl, I wanna know
Are you ready to cry? Cause I'm no good, no good
Ooh girl, I wanna try
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away
And I'm tryin' to say
I'm a piece of shit
Believe in this
I'm tellin' you
Cause we barely knew, what we had
I'm not that bad, the fun we had
Ooh

Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl and uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh

// Hold You Down //

[Hook]
Ooh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my help
I'll hold you down, oh
Ooh, you want it, yeah
Motherfuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh
Yeah, uh
Why in the fuck these niggas try and hold me down, ohh

[Verse 1]
You such a fuckin' lame
It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade
My momma said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down
Hit the office, stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found
Not bad for a family of foster child
Lookin' fly man, I'm flossin' now
But them niggas saw through me
Are you serious? What is this?
Took the jacket off third period, ellipsis
Listening to "Sky is the Limit" on my Walkman
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can
Dope-boy swag
I always wanted that
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ash
But no love for the son of a commuter
Who was a radio head and okay at them computers
At the post office
It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
All my people need throat lozenge
My fear is dead
Ambition drove the hearse
But niggas got my feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church
Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough
We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?
The black experience is blackened serious
Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us
White kids get to wear whatever hat they want
When it comes to black kids one size fits all

[Hook]

[Break]
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga
You hear me?
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest

[Verse 2]
The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's
The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
They only see you how they wanna see you
'Til you make them see you in some other way
I'm trippin' off the other day
Cause God knows what these white kids sayin'
Dude you're not not racist cause The Wire's in your Netflix cue
Subtle racism
It's hard to pin it cause you'd only understand
If you were me for just a minute
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad
Mostly cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
If you're a father, you should stick around if you could
Cause even if you're bad at it, you get Tiger Woods
MJ
We warriors, we all need senseis
Change everything that we've done so far
I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R
I mean just the way that we see each other
I won't stop until they say, "James Franco is the white Donald Glover"
Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness
Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice
Aimin' for the throne, Jay and Ye said to watch that
They ask me what I'm doin', I say I'm stealin' rock back
Nigga

[Hook x2]

// Kids (Keep Up) //

[Hook:]
If we were kids
I'd want to give you everything that you would want
Those other boys
They gave you toys, but all they wanna do is
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up

[Verse 1:]
I guess I'm fucking now
I'm getting used to it
It's cause I shine, and I ain't gotta use a crucifix
Fuck the fussing and fighting and arguing to this and that
And "Why you bein' mean to me Donald?" I never texted back
I know it's comin' quick, wishin' I could fast forward
Tell these nice girls they're the reason that I'm an asshole
Omega to alpha male because of that dollar bill
When I worked the mail room I ain't have a shot in hell
I called her ass for two months and heard shit from her
These girls couldn't care less when the chips under
The chips are up and on my shoulder, you heard me?
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it
The Girls I tried to hit last year, I still might
Karmas a bitch who doesn't suck, but I still like
If we were kids I had the black K-swiss and Reebok
If we were kids I wouldn't act like this but we not

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
You made a mistake
These dudes man you bathing in apes
Finding you is like finding Asians I hate
But they say I got a fetish, nah I'm skipping all of it
Black or white girls always come with a set of politics
That's all that I was saying
I'm a proud man
They wanna holla when they see your name on SoundScan
Her name Mercedes but she push a brown Focus
And she's doing coke in front of me, but act like I don't notice
"There any breakage in that Trojan?"
She see what she wanna see
So I make her take plan B in front of me
Women talk shit on men like all day
But it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways
They too busy stabbing hoes like OJ
They too busy trapping pros like Kobe
The only thing I put before me is do re
If you had told me the truth we'd be OK

[Hook]

// You See Me //

[Hook]
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA

[Verse 1]
I'm on my ish, call it
I watch these haters take they shots like they were alcoholics
"What is he wearing? Somebody jack that fool's steeze"
If I'm a faggot spell it right, I got way more than two G's
Nigga I'm amazing, I'm a phenom
I'm assassin, I'mma kill y'all
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa
Your shit's closed down cause I ball too hard
And I'm cumming on her face, have I gone too far?
I don't know, who cares, I don't love that broad
And it's funny how these nigga's always act hard
I'm a black star in a black car with a black card
They wanna knock me out
They try a nigga
Realest motherfucker in the game, like Tron nigga
Forget these white girls
I need some variation
Especially if she very Asian
She got an ugly friend? Roll solo
Can I stay at your place? No hobo
Not my fault, man, these ladies love me
She's an overachiever cause all she do is succeed

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Send me naked pics, I'mma Tumbl that
I'm the shit, been the shit, fuck a humble brag
Yeah I'm pushin' that, and her pussycat
I got swag out my ass so I'm usin' that
Texting with Olivia Munn, hopefully she'll give me some
Or some Rosie Jones, man
Hoes is hoes is hoes, man
Racks on racks on racks, man
All I got is tracks, man
Sorry for my accent, but I've been practicin'
Everywhere ya go niggas blastin' that Gambino
Niggas be like, "You ain't know?"
Bitches be like, "You ain't know?"
Met this fly Latino
Hope that she eighteen though
If she not, I'll say that I got deep throat in Heathrow

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Told me I was shit, but that shit couldn't stop me
Nigga still hungry, black kobayashi
When I talk about you I hear a "who?" like Horton
I was born for this shit, you a rappin' abortion
Can we hear the N-word one day and not get upset?
Can we try something new and not be suspect?
I don't really know, you fucked up bad
You don't wanna see my dudes when they get mad
I got a bunch of jackanapes at the back of me
That'll lacerate anyone in the back of a matinee
And laugh while they masturbate all over your beaten body
Sick boy forever, that Suburban Illuminati
Naw nigga, yeah we never stop
No period like menopause
No period like, "Oh shit!
Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"
Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"

// Sunrise //

[Verse 1]
Yeah nigga, it's me again
I'm still around, I guess I win
You hear me in your sister's room like all the time
Gambino Girl forever on that bracelet that she bought online
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, "hasta luega"
Cause I'm taking all your city like I'm Carmen San Diego
I'm smoking, I'm on fire
I am blazin', don't get hurt
To my white dudes it's a concert
To my black nerds this is church
From that NYU dorm to the Emory
Everyone hated me, I'm more hip hop than you'll ever be
Im bustin', bustin' bustin', bustin' on these niggas man
And nothin, nothing nothin, nothin is the same again
You lookin dumb as hell man for ever sleeepin' on him
Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin on him
Will he fail?
Now that's the wrong conversation
Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, uh

[Hook x2]
Hey, what it do bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit

[Verse 2]
New shit
You didn't know?
Black rock like a fuckin' LOST episode
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own
So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her
And the fly rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water
And I'm lookin' at her butt
Thats that 20/20 hindsight
My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson: 5 Mikes
Donald Glover, no relation
Always workin', no vacation
They couldn't feel me, novacation
Murder versus the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom
I've wanted this since a three-year-old
I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole
Bein' me, that's something that's so unusual
I've seen the future, and the future go

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Can't you hear me baby?
Can't you hear me callin' out your name?
Can't you hear me baby?
Oh, can't you hear me callin' out your name?

// That Power //

All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you dont even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh

So CG, but a nigga stay real though
I'm fly, I'm ill, I'm running shit
3-points, field goal
Rappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell
Cause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian, bail
Yeah, they starin' at me jealous cause I do shows bigger
But your looks don't help like an old gold digger
Uncool, but lyrically I'm a stone cold killer
So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut niggas
Yeah, now that's the line of the century
Niggas missed it, too busy, they lyin' 'bout penitentiary
Man, you ain't been there, nigga you been scared
And I'm still living single like Synclaire
Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate
When I wasn't white enough to use your pool when I was eight
Stone Mountain, you raised me well
I'm stared at by Confederates, but hard as hell
Tight jeans, penny loafers, but I still drink a four dime
Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides
I'm just a kid who blowing up with my father's name
And every black "you're not black enough"
Is a white "you're all the same"
DOOM Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes
Cuz it's oreos, twinkies, coconuts, delicious
How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?
I said I want a full house
They said, "You got it, dude!"

All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you dont even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh

Holla, holla, holla, holla at your boy
Like your dad when he's pissed off
Got flow, I could make a crippled crip walk
Niggas' breath stank, all they do is shit talk
People want a real man, I made 'em wait this long
Maybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'
And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins
How'd it happen? Honesty did it
See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit
Yeah, I bodied the limits and I deaded them fakers
Motherfuck if you hate it, cremated them haters
So, my studio be a funeral
Yeah, this is our year, oh you didn't know?
Uh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den
Man I'm hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead
On stage with my family in front of me
I am what I am: everything I wanna be

All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you dont even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh

This is on a bus back from camp
I'm thirteen and so are you
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble
It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That's you
And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus
And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles
I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
But I don't know if you do or don't more-than-like me
You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer
Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh
Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
A girl who reads books that no one's assigned to her
Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet

Back in the real world we don't go to the same school
And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
We won't go to the same high school
So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something
And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep
We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
That looks like a kid we know
And then I'm like, "Can I tell you something?"
And all of a sudden I'm telling you
And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
And your face is there and gone and there and gone
As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
And there's no expression on it
And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time
Where we live in a world where you haven't said "yes" or "no" yet
And regrettably I end up using the word "destiny"
I don't remember in what context. Doesn't really matter
Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, "okay"
I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive
And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
But there's nowhere to go because we're on a bus
So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am

I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore
The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
I turn and you're not there
Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore
We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now
Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
Just as one of them reaches my row
It used to be our row, on our way off
It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
After throwing rocks at my head
Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
She stops and looks down at me
And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face
But I can see her smile. And she says one word: "destiny"
Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
And then she turns and leads them off the bus
I didn't know you were friends with them

I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over
So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts
This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
This is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not
I'm just saying it's what I learned
I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always
Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them
But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you
Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose
I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit
But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus
I still haven't
