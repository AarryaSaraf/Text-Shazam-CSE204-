Do what you want!
I'm telling you, let me into your heart
Can't stand it, backhanded
They wanna see us fallin' apart
You know that I love you
So let me into your heart
Let me into your heart
Do you really love me?

This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars
I know where you've been, you can see the sun
Let me into your heart!
I really love you, girl

Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love

I'm in love when we are smokin' that
Oh my God, I
Let me into
Girl you really got a hold, woo!

// Have Some Love //

Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find

You got the power, you got the power
Of every hour, of every hour
I come to get you and I know where you are
I come to get you and I know where you are

It's getting hot, it's like a sauna
Then every night, in Arizona
They come to get you when they grope in your mind
They think you creepy, getting down in your mind

Come to get you, come to get you
It doesn't matter, you making magic
I got the business to make a mind
I got the business to make a mind

And if you feel it, if you feel in your toes
And you're nothing like it, nobody knows
But if you want it, you better want it

Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word

Come on, baby, oh
Darling no, no, no, no, no, no, no
That's right, baby
That's right
I see wherever, wherever, wherever you are
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)
I see wherever, wherever, wherever you are
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)
Wherever, wherever, wherever you are
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)
Do no wrong now
That's right, baby

There's a big wide world out there
I need to get in
We have got to really stay together
And I hope and I pray
We will find it someday
We have to got to really stay together
So

Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find

// Boogieman //

With a gun in your hand, I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

If you point a gun at my rising sun
Though we're not the one
But in the bounds of your mind
We have done the crime

Boogieman
You've got to help us, can you? Yes I can
Boogieman
You've got to help us, can you? Yes I can

With a gun in your hand, I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

Every boy and girl all around the world
Knows my niggas' words
But if he's scared of me, how can we be free? Yeah

Boogieman, yes
You've got to help us, can you? Yes I can, oh
Boogieman
You've got to help us, can you? Yes I can, oh

// Zombies //

[Childish Gambino:]
All I see is zombies
Walking all around us
You can hear them coming (they come to take your life)
You can hear them breathing, breathing down your spine

All I see is zombies
Hear them screaming at her
They can smell your money
And they want your soul
Here they come behind you
Try to stay alive

[Kari Faux:]
We're coming out to get you
We're oh, so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it

[Childish Gambino:]
You will find there is no safe place to hide
(That's right, that's right)

All I see is zombies
Feeding all around us
All they eat are people (and you won't survive)
They don't know what happened
They just stay alive

[Kari Faux:]
We're coming out to get you
We're oh, so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it

[Childish Gambino:]
You will find there is no safe place to hide
(That's right, that's right)

[Kari Faux:]
We're coming out to get you
We're oh so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it

[Childish Gambino:]
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Do-do-do-do-do
Do you feel alive?

// Riot //

I can feel it
Deep inside my body
I've been watching all this all night
I got to move it
This pressure brewing
This world don't feel alright

Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, sun

No good fighting
World, we're out of captains
Everyone just wants a better life
They tried to kill us
Love to say they feel us
But they won't take my pride

Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, sun
Everyone
Get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone
Get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, sun

// Redbone //

Daylight, I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know but now, that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long, you made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for a boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, ooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it

But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin'
Ooh, now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

If you want it, oh
You can have it, you can have it
If you need it
You better believe in something
We can make it
If you want it
You can have it, aah!

But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin'
Put your hands up on me
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes
But stay woke, ooh
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin'
Ooh, now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

How'd it get so scandalous?
How'd it get so scandalous?
Oh, oh
Baby you
How'd it get...
How'd it get so scandalous?
How'd it get so scandalous?
But stay woke
But stay woke

// California //

She want to move to California
She must've fucking lost her mind
She want to move to California
It's hard to get through every time

She make a movie with her friends, put it up in a minute
And everybody say it now ain't [?]
Everybody say how, how you do it, you did it
I'ma show you what it done but, enough for a finish
Girl you think and you listen
You keep losing your mind
How you want to loop this shit but looking like a vine

But they don't pay for no privilege, now she broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented, but they get your percentage

In California, ooh
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly

All the people in the room and the follower people
Like I'm watching the "ha ha" make his girlfriend giggle
Let's make official official, make a [?]
Don't pay no residual, making money a little
Make the smoker illegal, make the living illegal
Make the laughing illegal, make it snap for a people
When you make a movie now, no you making no difference
It's a tickle on the mind before me finish the sentence
[?] like a vine but don't pay for the privilege

Now you broke in Koreatown, in the condo you rented
But they get your percentage
Oh you broke in Koreatown in that condo you rented
But they get your percentage

In California
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly

// Terrified //

There's a bottom to the top of the moment
You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind ya
People want you underground
Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run to me, baby
Uh, are not

Just hide, oh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!
Just hide, oh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!

I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up...

Just hide, oh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!
Just hide, oh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Please
No, no, no, oh
Oh you can't run from me
You can't hide from me

// Baby Boy //

Little hands, little feet
Tiny heart, tiny beat
Oh, thinkin' about the time we spent falling in love (in love)
I don't wanna leave you
I don't wanna deceive you
But, oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies
Oh, my, please don't take him away, no, no, no
Don't take him away

Oh, 'cause I had my doubts, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close
I hope I stay close

All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one and they know your son
Oh, please don't take him away
You say you won't but you will

Oh, 'cause I had my doubts, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close
I hope I stay close

There was a time before you, and there will be a time after you
Though these bodies are not our own
Walk tall, little one
Walk tall
Let me hold you
Let me hold you

// Stand Tall //

When the sun is rising over streets so barren
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92, I listen
To what my father said

Keep all your dreams, keep  standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can
When you can

How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said

Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall (oh I, nah, nah, nah)
If you are strong you cannot fall (if you are strong)
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can
When you can

If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side
Woo, oh!
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do

Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
There is more out there
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall

Give me morning
When you're gone to yourself
Woo!
Yeah!
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall)
If you are strong you cannot fall)
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall)
(If you are strong you cannot fall)
Thanks for doing that
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall)
(If you are strong you cannot fall)
