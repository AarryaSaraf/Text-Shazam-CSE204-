Baby, you can find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up, don't you wanna just
Come along for the ride?
Pull my outfits up tight
You can see my heartbeat tonight
I can take the heat, baby, best believe
That's the moment I shine

'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Watch me dance, dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance, dance the night away (Ah-huh)
I still keep the party running, not one hair out of place

Lately I've been moving close to the edge
Still be looking my best
I stay on the beat, you can count on me
I ain't missing no steps

'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Watch me dance, dance the night away
My heart could be burning, but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance (Dance), dance the night away (Ah-huh)
I still keep the party running, not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks (They'll never see it, never see it)
When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)
I don't play it safe (Ooh), don't you know about me? (Ah-huh)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Even when the tears are flowing like diamonds on my face
I still keep the party going, not one hair out of place (Yes, I can)
Even when the tears are flowing like diamonds on my face (Yes, I can, yes, I can)
I still keep the party going, not one hair out of place

Watch me dance, dance the night away (Ah-huh)
My heart could be burning, but you won't see it on my face
Watch me (Dance) dance, dance the night away (Ah-huh)
I still keep the party running, not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks (They'll never see it, never see it)
When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)
I don't play it safe, don't you know about me? (Ah-huh)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Dance the night
