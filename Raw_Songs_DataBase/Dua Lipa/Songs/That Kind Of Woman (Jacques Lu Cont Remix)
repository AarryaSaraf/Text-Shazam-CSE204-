That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman
That kind of woman

One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops
And it's not me to be one, to be one
I'll pick you from the crowd
Don't come to me
I want you to myself
No, I won't be, won't be one
Won't be one

I'll be the first to say
"Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya
That kind of woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still
Let me show ya
That kind of woman, woman

That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman
That kind of woman

'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a stand
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya

That kind of woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

That kind of woman

(I'm Gonna)
Keep you close, next to me
I won't let you go
(You're gonna)
Reminisce
That you once met a girl like this
I'll be the first to say, the first to say, the first to say, the first to say
That kind of woman
The first to say, the first to say, the first to say, the first to say
That kind of woman, woman
The first to say, the first to say, the first to say, the first to say
That kind of woman, woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still
Let me show ya
That kind of woman, woman

That kind of woman
