It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you 
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through


And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have ever said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in


Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through


And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have ever said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in


Cold, cold heart (Oh)
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby (Oh)
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)


And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have ever said (And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)
('Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find)
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in (I'm not the man they think I am at home)
(Oh, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no, no)
