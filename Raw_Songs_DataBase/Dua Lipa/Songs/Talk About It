Blame it on the night
One too many at the dive
Saw you called a thousand times
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it
Danced until I cried
Took a hit and got too high
Started questioning my life
Let's not talk about it, won't talk about it

I'm waking up to messages
Don't recognize the name
I'm wondering who the F it is
'Cause I don't know any Janes
Somebody next to me in my bed
Hold up, wait, this isn't my bed
Telling myself never again, again

(Ah) I don't know what happened to my friends
(To my friends) Or where I been
(Ah) And I can't tell you how this story ends
And I can't pretend

Blame it on the night
One too many at the dive
Saw you called a thousand times
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it
Danced until I cried
Took a hit and got too high
Started questioning my life
Let's not talk about it, won't talk about it

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it

How am I in the club again?
Said I was staying in (Ah, ah)
Having another heart to heart
With someone that I just met (Ah)
And the next thing that I know (I know)
Is I wake up in my clothes (Ah-ah)
And the voice inside my head (My head)
Says never again, again

(Ah) I don't know what happened to my friends
(To my friends) Or where I been (Ah-ah-ah)
And I can't tell you how this story ends
And I can't pretend (Ah-ah-ah)

Blame it on the night
One too many at the dive
Saw you called a thousand times
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it
Danced until I cried
Took a hit and got too high
Started questioning my life
Let's not talk about it, won't talk about it

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it

Blame it on the night, blame the alcohol
Blame anyone you like, 'cause I can't be held responsible
Blame it on the night, blame the alcohol
Blame anyone you like, 'cause I can't be held responsible

Blame it on the night
One too many at the dive
Saw you called a thousand times
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it
Danced until I cried
Took a hit and got too high
Started questioning my life
Let's not talk about it, won't talk about it

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it
