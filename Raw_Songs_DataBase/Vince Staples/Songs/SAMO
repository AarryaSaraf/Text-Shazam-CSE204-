Way up, way up
Way up, way up

SAMO thing
Watch me do the same old thing
If I wrote your ass a love song, could I make it bang?
If I pull up with my guns drawn, run, I make it bang
Homie, tell me where you come from, tell me what you bang
Ain't a damn thing funny, but we laughin' to the bank
Never blow it on chains, rather blow my fuckin' brain
Decorator came from Spain, blow the budget on an accent couch
What that accent 'bout? Southern California livin'
Daddy in and out of prison, ain't no father to my style
I'm the ODB of the OPB
When I go OT, all the shows sold out
And the hoes show out, tryna be a baby mama
Tryna break a player pockets, that's a no no
This day forward, I ain't takin' photos
Then we wear our old clothes, we ain't givin' promo no mo'

Just the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing
Do the same old thing, do the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing, just the same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Chain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing

Win the race or fix your face, your woman on my dinner plate
I'm comin' for that last supper, center seat, I've been a G
I traffic 'cross the interstate
We cracked and launched the murder rate
They know who did the killin', but they didn't see
Want a verse? This the price. Want a show? This the fee
We don't do no bargain shoppin', we don't show no empathy
Empty out your pockets, $10,000 fee for that talkin'
I gotta take this extra five
No doubt in mind, we the best alive
No testifyin', we silent
Never told on my partners
My partner and 'em got bodies
I'm tryna put 'em in robbers
They used to put us in G rides, so now I put 'em in college
Put 'em on with this business then put 'em on with your mama

Just the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing
Do the same old thing, do the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing, just the same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Chain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing

Way up, way up
Way up, way up
