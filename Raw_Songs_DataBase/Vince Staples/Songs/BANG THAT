Playin' with them weapons where the waves crash
Runnin' up a check, I'm tryna chase racks
Sendin' ops to heaven, tell 'em stay mad

Say you not in love, set him up then
Soon as lil' homie learn the ropes he getting jumped in

Fourteen, shooting up the function

Same Loc since way back
My granny Cadi had the four flats
Stay woke, yeah, stay strapped
Hang obituaries, I don't hang plaques

Play hoes, hate rats
You know them crackers want the gang trapped
Thuggin' with the same cats
Stole the fork up out the road and made the 'caine crack

Find me by the water, I can bang now
All about a dollar, I can bang that, yeah
Ridin' for my partnas, I can bang that
I do what I wanna, I can bang that, yeah
Slidin' with a chopper in a Maybach

Fuck 'em, won't forgive em, I can bang that, yeah

Put on the set like it's tailored for me
Got in the game and I gave it for free
Shells on the ground 'cause we playing for keeps
If I go down, will you save it for me?

I love the money, she more than a friend
Never forget how the story began
Real as they come, I don't gotta pretend
Live by the gun, die by the sand

Find me by the water, I can bang now
All about a dollar, I can bang that, yeah
Ridin' for my partnas, I can bang that
I do what I wanna, I can bang that, yeah
Slidin' with a chopper in a Maybach
