Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be disheartening, darling
Love can be


Love can be a loss or maybe not
You can give me all the cash you got
Slap me, take the keys, go round the block
Make some memories and die 
I'm over you
You talk a lot of shit, unamused
Ain't puttin' on the ritz
I could finish you like I fit in shoes
So you know my name
I'm not your babe
What's that you're saying?
I don't speak lame
You know my name
I'm not your babe
Thinking of coming?
Kindly refrain


Wannabes buzzing
Girls love the lifestyle
So prone to clubbing
Come alive when the night's out
Just crashed the sports car
So much for fast life
Phone calls from loves lost
Tryna get back right


Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be, yeah
Love can be so disheartening, darling
Love can be
Love can be, yeah
Love can be


Tell the world I want my OGs
Dodge the groupies, them don't move me
Uchies moved me somewhere cozy
Uchies never leave me lonely
Call my phone, say she horny, want me
I can make time or I can make money
I'ma keep countin', count me out, shawty
Never let a bitch Lil Bow Wow me
Never finna weaken, raise my seat
Baby mama drama on the TMZ
Alimony money for the nails and weave
Nail me to the cross like that boy JC
Chuckin' up the deuce like the boy Chris Breeze
But we don't Su Woo on the six-five street
Riding down the shoreline, tank on E
No shotgun seat, this dick ain't free


Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be (disheartening, darling)
Love can be
Love can be

Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be disheartening, darling
Love can be
Love can be
