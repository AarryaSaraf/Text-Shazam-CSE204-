Champagne Wishlist, Bad Hoes
Smear that slipstick, Black Porsche
Gt with stick shift
Seat heaters, came with' bisquick
Break fast, stop a niggas lifeline
Speed off, leave him dead at the red-light
Tell them bitch ass niggas, get they bread right
Or get they lead right
Load up we out here erry night

Let me take you niggas back in the day
When some niggas from my city claim east side pain
It was like '08, sidekick '08s
That we here for
Filithyz made racks off robbery
Ain't a nigga livin' stoppin' me
Unless he poppin' me
Momma said I lost the God in me, My apology,
Live for takin' niggas property
Gangsta' hawk in me
Asking if the coppers follow me, Nigga probably
But I ain't never been scared of a lil' swine
Down to do a lil' time
Gimme space to clear my mind
Countin' up the sins of mine
Ran outta hands and feet
Holla' at me if you need the hands, I'll supply your need
I need the cheese, like a dope man needs the fiend
I don't believe anything' a nigga ever see
The only thing that scaring me, is a better me
So testin' me, you'll put your life in jeopardy

I introduce to you America's disaster
Known as young black man with'out a master
Ain't signin' shit unless you givin niggas masters
The old men in space that I roam ima blast em
So try to play me and you kno' what's coming after
A hit em with them yam, like lebron on the gather
Never been a pacifist
Blame it on my pastor
When they tried to gimme ass to kiss
I gave them automatics
Makin' matters worse, every time I patch a verse
Blame the FBI for the unsuspected death of mine
Columbine, when it's chopper time
Chopper, chop her down, chopper style
Still a juvenile, but I'm runnin' wild
