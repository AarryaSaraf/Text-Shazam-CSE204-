I do it
(Turn it up)
I do it, yeah
(Hey turn it up)
I do it
Ay

Man down, white sheets, yellow tape
That's what you get for tryna hesitate
My homies go so hard they medicate
We never making it to heaven's gates

Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down

Okay, now baby, let me see you drop that ass to the ground
Okay, now baby, come and see me on the Norf of the town
You know I love you, let me cuff you if it's round and it's brown
Grandmama told me keep them homely, hungry citches from 'round
I told her everybody love me, she said, "Not them people, trust me"
She said they just wanna fuck me, she said they just want some money
She said they just want mandingo, don't be giving up my C-Notes
I said these is blue strips
Throw 'em up like a true Crip
Growing up I was too slick
You can't play me 'cause I got the game

Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Okay, now baby, let me see you drop that ass to the ground
Okay, now, hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Okay, now baby, let me see you drop that ass to the ground
Okay, now

Sweet Baby Jesus
Please give me the strength to keep from maxing out my Visas
Lunch at Matsuhisa, no more eating Little Caesars
Pressure life can stress you out when everybody need ya
Love ya but they'll bleed ya
Got it out the hard way, Artesia Boulevard way
Ay, Ramona Park way
Ay, we did it our way
And can do it all day
You see I live for that
Tell him kill that noise before I kill his ass man

Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
OK now
