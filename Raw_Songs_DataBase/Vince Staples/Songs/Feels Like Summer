Whatever day, vibe, month it is, it just feels like summer
You know what I'm saying?
It always feels like summer in the neighborhood man
When you get a chance to come in
You get a chance to lay back, you get a chance to laugh
You get a chance to chill, best believe that, man
And being that it always feels like summer
Let's go ahead and make you feel like summer


Summertime in the LB wild
We gon' party 'til the sun or the guns come out
JB first one fouled out playing ball
Now the whole city love you, how?
But we know they wasn't down from the get go
Dirty got a dozen rounds, better get low
Lil Johnny gave his life for this shit
All he got was a plot and a bottle from the Winco
Still Norfside, Parkside, Vince stole
Two wins, new friends, we skip those
Try finessin' my way into Heaven, might hit that gate
Might fall from a big spla
On the concrete, real street runner
First month still feel like summer
Cold weather won't stop no gunner
Wrong hat, wrong day, I'd kill my brother


Ayy, summertime in the LB
Know it ain't shit a broke nigga gon' tell me now
Drop top with the top down now
All the bad bitches gon' feel me now, ayy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah


Scared money don't make money, hey
White man want take from me, hey
White fans at the Coachella, hey
Never been touched, niggas know better, hey
Same ways since Summer School Baby Jay
Either I'ma make the news or make a play
Pass Alyssa house, coulda took a different route
Wouldn't be without, think about it every day
Moved on, life fast like that
Still struggle with the past, I'm strapped
Somebody gotta watch my back
Everybody wanna count my bag
Ease off me, these streets taught me
Speak softly, please don't taunt me
Knowin' Vic and them stayed on 8th
If they killed me, then I'd be great
Now they lookin' at me


Summertime in the LB
Know it ain't shit a broke nigga gon' tell me now
Drop top with the top down now
All the bad bitches gon' feel me now, ayy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah


Here it is man, I told y'all, "Feels like Summer"
No matter when it is man, it always feels like summer in the Neighborhood
And being that it feels like summer, let's do this man
Let's go outside
