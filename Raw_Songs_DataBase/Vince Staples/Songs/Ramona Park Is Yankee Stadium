New York, New York
Bright lights in dark skies
If I die today
Would you even know I existed?
Would you see my face?
How I love you so
You are so far away
You're in my skin, above my brain
If I should pass away
New York, New York
Bright lights in dark skies
If I die today
Would you even know I existed?
Would you see my face?
How I love you so
You are so far away
You're in my skin, above my brain
If I should pass away
Gunshot
