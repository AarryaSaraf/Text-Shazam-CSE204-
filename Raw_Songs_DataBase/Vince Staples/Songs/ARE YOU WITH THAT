City goin' up (Up), so you better bust
Finna see who really one of us
Really spillin' blood (Cuz)
Everybody tough 'til they gotta go and see the judge
Nigga better hush (Hush)
Remember growin' up, all I wanted was to be a thug
Wanted me a plug (Plug) to get a lil' bread
Shoot a couple niggas in the head
Still outside (Outside), I don't hide
From this shit for life
Had to fight (I swear) for my life
Took them hits in stride (I swear)

Have my candlelight goin' up (Up) like the club
After that, go slide (Slide)

Visit my Crips that lay (Lay)
Under the ground, runnin' around (Yeah)
We was them kids that played (Dead homies)
All in the street, followin' leads
Of niggas who lost they ways (Dead homies)
Some of them outside still (Still)
Some of them inside graves
I'm a real beach boy (I'm a real beach boy)
Come ride my wave (Wave)
Left me with a either-or
Fill these voids or fill my bank (Ayy, ayy)
Blue strips only, you switched on me
Mama told me 'bout you snakes
Keep my shit off safety (Yeah)
You know you can never be too safe (You know it)

Are you with that? I won't get back
