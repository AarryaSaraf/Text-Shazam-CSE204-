I just came up in this right hand when I was walkin' into the yard
Slide
And, um, they just opened up, and there's no other way to put it, they just , slide down a little, paow, paow, paow
Slide

Made 'em proud but I never made a million
I'm talking net, I heart the set, I'm tryna raise the children
From the Naughty where we ain't pretending
Made a lot of niggas die but I ain't admitting, damn

Ain't forgetting, can't forgive 'em
Preying on 'em, no, it ain't religion
Sick of niggas, no, it ain't remission
With it even though I hate the killings
Rather point it at the crackers, FN with the ladder

Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide

I love my momma 'cause she did her best
I feel nirvana when I'm in the set
We see who pop it on the internet
Catch one, it's a bet
It's a wrap, hit his lungs if he run
Hit his back, if he crawl hit his hat
Out here living raps

Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide

Late night, who rides
Grey slides, suits, ties
