Yeah
Yeah, yeah
(Where you're from, where you're from)

Yeah, I could die tonight, so today I'm finna go get paid
I'm the violent type so don't play 'less you want yo grave
We was in the hood, rent was late, ain't have section 8
Had a.38 in the 8th, moved on 68th
Then they put us out, we was sleeping on my auntie couch
Then she put us out, stomach growling, stealing from the Ralph's
If I pull it out Ima send a nigga to the clouds
Watch them bullets bounce, fell in love with guns, I love the sound, yeah

From the sun up till the sun is down, yeah
Tryna run it up, I'm running wild, yeah
From the sun up till the sun is down, yeah
Tryna run it up, I'm running wild, yeah

I don't fear no man, only Allah got the upper hand
Lost too many friends to the down the streets, I can't pretend
That I'll make amends, I know that the blood gon' spill again
Hanging on them corners same as hanging from a ceiling fan
When I see my fans I'm too paranoid to shake they hands
Clutching on the blam, don't know if you foe or if you fam
I don't gotta plan, I'm just out here thuggin' till the end
Niggas know I'll never fold or bend, yeah

From the sun up till the sun is down, yeah
Tryna run it up, I'm running wild, yeah
From the sun up till the sun is down, yeah
