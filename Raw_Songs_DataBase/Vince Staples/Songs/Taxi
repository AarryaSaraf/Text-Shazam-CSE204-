She was more beautiful than anything I've ever seen
Was the dream I had longed for, for many years
How it broke my heart to see her shed a tear
But she deserved it
I wasn't perfect, na I never been
So tell me why the hell was you expecting that?
Bitchin' and complaining seems to me like you perfected that
If I would've knew I would have never got so damn attached
Found out that she loves me not
Now I'm in this Cadillac
Please don't panic pretty lady
I won't do no stupid shit
Just wanna be the one you love
The one you hug
The one you kiss
It's funny cuz; ever since you left I even miss the shit you used to do to piss me off
They say an un-tampered love is lost
So I'm not downing you
Really though, I'm happy that you found a dude
But anyway
Is the rope a little tight?
It seems as if your wrist are bleeding
And I hope the tape around your lips doesn't constrict your breathing
Not much room, but the trunks filled actually
That's why I got you in the back seat, love taxi
That's why I got you in the back seat

No
Don't you know I love you so
So tell me why you wanna go
Don't leave me
Alone

Sitting here, loathing in this ambiance
Staring at the shrine of miscellaneous body parts
I think of how we got off to such a sloppy start
And what seems worst a slit throat, or a tarnished heart?
I guess I got the raw end of the deal
Because this pain will last forever, yours ended in shrills
Now my life's a nightmare, but it seems so real
Our love was full force yet you chose to yield
So we crashed, face first blood on the dash
I guess the best lesson in life is nothing that last
Fast-forward to this fucked up position I'm in
Contemplating why to live, when I'm living in sin
But shit, niggas like me, wasn't meant to go to heaven
We was meant to be alone, die, hanging from the ceiling
Tried praying for forgiveness but God told me to shut up
