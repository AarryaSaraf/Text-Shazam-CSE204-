Hey, look here, I done, I die Rip, I, like I told Nicole
I said, "Hey, I done got on the witness stand and lied my ass off
So, so your daddy didn't go to jail
For tryna shoot somebody"
I said and I done, I said you know and I ain't even know I had did that
I had forgot I had did it, I was looking for it
And I, I, I, I, had to be kinda out of my mind, but I was angry
You know sometimes when I got angry I didn't think
So I, I done went over somebody house
I knew the girl, I knew them people in the house and everything
But I'm over there looking for somebody
You know tryna get a nigga, you know what I mean?
I'm like shit
And they said, "You don't remember that time you came over our house, girl, looking for so-and-so?"
Ooh, we didn't even open up the door
We like damn, she at the door, I ain't, I ain't gon' open it!
You know I'm like damn, I must've been real stupid
Hehe, but I'm just saying, to the point where I'm tryna make is where I came from
You know what I mean?
You know I was singing in the choir with a gun in my purse
So don't go there with me
Don't tell me what, I don't care what you want, you dead
