If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin'-

I ain't never quitting on my homies from the set
Rather die a legend than be living with regrets
Granny up in Heaven, know she watch a nigga back
G-Class flying down Orizaba Ave

I know that you love me but you gotta give me space
Money hungry women do whatever for a taste
All my people in the hood, what's it finna take
To have everybody living good? I don't wanna wait

In a minute I'ma bust a jug, I'ma make a play
Hit the homie up and hit a lick, run in where you stay
All the pressure I be dealing with still ain't never change
I'm about the money, I ain't fucking with the fame

You should see the limit on my Amex
One phone call and it's niggas at your address
I'm gon' ball till I'm sitting in a grave
Fuck all y'all, bet Ramona get the last laugh

Close your mouth when you talking to a killer, bitch
They say I murdered Cuh, I say I'm innocent
This ain't suburbia, these niggas ignorant
I always get my man, I only miss my bitch

Hit me up if you wish
I'm in the studio, couple guns, couple Crips
Tryna make a hundred M's, what's a couple bands?
Keep it coming in, keep it coming in

(Get paid, yeah, get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid)
Nigga that you know that's been down for years
I've clowned for years, and y'all could never fade my peers
One, two, three, four, five-
