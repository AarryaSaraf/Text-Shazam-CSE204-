Nigga met this nigga at the McDonalds at Lakewood Mall
This nigga like, randomly like bro I got the blue LX for your.38 derringer
Mind you nigga this a, this a, you feel me?
This the lil pearl handle, handle thang
In and out, nigga give it to him
Later on that night nigga get pulled over
Police thoroughly search the car
On God, nigga woulda got cracked If I woulda kept it
And they never even knew I got rid of the gun
I never told em so the whole time they searching, everybody in the car scared
I forgot to tell em like nigga been gave that shit away
Then, niggas go to this little party, whatever the case
Niggas like fuck it we ain't got nothing to do, we gon go
Mind you niggas ain't had shit to do all day niggas been getting robbed and some more shit its, its, wild
Vince like naw I'm cool
Nigga go shake, go home
Later on that night, the homies, they get booked
Two bodies, crazy, allegedly though
Free Ty Bud
Moral of this whole story
Niggas gotta think ahead, which a nigga always have
You gotta separate yourself from bullshit
Can't get wrapped up in it
And once again its still free Pac Slimm till they free Pac Slimm
