Can't wait til I'm rich, I'm finna buy a whole crate of guns
From 'round 90 Crips, shit I really came from the slums
Time to represent, let me see you bang, where you from
Don't be acting spooked, I'm a troop, I don't give a fuck
I just wanna live it up, used to make 'em give it up
Flockin' is for hoes, I'ma take somebody's soul
He gone give me what he own, now I'm getting what I'm owed
You might see me at a show, oh you missing out
Swear I bring the realest out
Everybody know me who's somebody to know (Somebody to know)
Watch me mind my business while I'm counting my dough (While I'm counting my dough)
Stay away from snitches who would clown me before (Clown me before)
On the road to riches they gone step on your toes

Sammy told me that a change gone come (Gone come)
I'm not going if my gang won't come (Won't come)
If you see me pull that thang don't run (Don't run)
Playing ball, if I swing home run


I ain't on that medication
It's only money that I'm chasing, that is all
Represent my location
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped
Don't get chipped
Nigga, I ain't got the patience, yeah
My hustle like a mental patient, I'm tryna ball
Let me run my demonstration
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped
Don't get chipped


Everybody say it's lonely at the top
I want my homies at the top, my little homie he got shot
And now I'm moving my lonely with the .40 in the mop
Finna pull up early morning and somebody getting dropped
I throw a party on your block, like I'm Tommy the clown
Hundred thousand dollar car, bet you proud of me now
Took my mama out the set, house as big as my mouth
Started yelling out regrets, so I shot in the crowd, pow!
You a fan, I'm the man, it's a difference
Stop pretending, you know you feel it
Record deal, but I did it independent
If I peel then somebody going missing

Granny told me they just wanted me down
I'm the nigga that they wanna be now
Who done did it like I did it from the hometown
Start dead broke, but I'm on now


I ain't on that medication
It's only money that I'm chasing, that is all
Represent my location
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped
Don't get chipped
Nigga, I ain't got the patience, yeah
My hustle like a mental patient, I'm tryna ball
Let me run my demonstration
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped
Don't get chipped
