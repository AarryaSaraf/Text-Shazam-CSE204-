Album: FineLine

// Golden //

Golden, golden, golden
As I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping
Take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken
So you wait for me in the sky
Browns my skin just right

You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head
And I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
When it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I, I can feel it take a hold
I can feel you take control
Of who I am and all I've ever known
Loving you's the antidote

Golden
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head
And I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
I know that you're scared
Because I'm so open

You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head
And I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

// Adore You //

Walk in your rainbow paradise
Strawberry lipstick state of mind
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?

You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine

Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

You're wonder, under summer skies
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna tell you something
Lately you've been on my mind

Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

(It's the only thing I'll ever do)
(It's the only thing I'll ever do)
(It's the only thing I'll ever do)
(It's the only thing I'll ever do)
(It's the only thing I'll ever do)
(It's the only thing I'll ever do)
(It's the only thing I'll ever do)
(It's the only thing I'll ever do)

I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh honey
Oh honey

I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you

Oh honey
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

// Lights Up //

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
I'm never coming back down
Can't you see
I could but wouldn't stay?
I wouldn't put it like that

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
I'm never coming around
It'd be so sweet if
Things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da

All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Running through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?

(Shine)
Step into the light (Shine)
So bright sometimes (Shine)
I'm not ever going back

(Shine)
Step into the light (Shine)
So bright sometimes (Shine)
I'm not ever going back

(Shine)
Step into the light (Shine)
So bright sometimes (Shine)
I'm not ever

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
I'm never going back now
It'd be so sweet if
Things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da

La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da

All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Running through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?

// Cherry //

Don't you call him 'baby'
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

I, I confess
I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it

I noticed that
There's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment

Don't you call him 'baby'
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?

Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?

Don't you call him 'baby'
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

Don't you call him 'baby'
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j'suis désolée...
Bah non... Nan, c'est pas important...
Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—
Parfait ! Harry

// Falling //

I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands

Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now?
What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

You said you cared
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you

And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now?
What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now?
What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

// To Be So Lonely //

Don't blame me for falling
I was just a little boy
Don't blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all
You can't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit
I was away
And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch who can't admit when he's sorry

Don't call me "baby" again
You got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends
I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again
It's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

I just hope you see me
In a little better light
Do you think it's easy
Being of the jealous kind?
'Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You'll win
It's just a trick
And this is it, so I'm sorry

Don't call me "baby" again
You got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends
I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again
It's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely
To be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely
To be so
To be so lonely

And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch who can't admit when he's sorry

Don't call me "baby" again
You got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends
I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again
It's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely
To be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely
To be so
To be so lonely

// She //

9 in the morning
The man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you
Like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32
Like he knows what to do

She
She lives in daydreams with me
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is

He takes a boat out
Imagines just sailing away (Away, away)
And not telling his mates (Not telling his mates)
He wouldn't know what to say (Wouldn't know what to say, to say)

She
She lives in daydreams with me
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is

She
She's the first one that I see
She lives in daydreams with me
And I don't know why
I don't know where she is

Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head
And she sleeps in his bed
While he plays pretend
So pretend

She
She lives in daydreams with me
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is

She
She's the first one that I see
She lives in daydreams with me
And I don't know why
I don't know where she is

// Sunflower, Vol. 6 //

Sunflower
Sunflower
My eyes
Want you more than a melody
Let me inside
Wish I could get to know you

Sunflowers
Sometimes
Keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied

And I don't wanna make you feel bad, but I've been trying hard not to talk to you
My sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)

I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more tonight

Wondering headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouth full of toothpaste
Before I got to know you

I've got your face
Hung up high in the gallery
Out of this shade (Sunflower, sunflower)

Your flowers just died
Plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you
I don't wanna make you feel bad, but I've been trying hard not to act a fool
My sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)

I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more tonight
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the kitchen listen to dance hall
I couldn't want you any more tonight

Sunflower
My eyes
Want you more than a melody
Let me inside
Wish I could get to know you

Sunflowers just died
Keep it sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower

// Canyon Moon //

You gotta see it to believe it
Sky never looked so blue
So hard to leave it
That's what I always do
So I keep thinking back to
A time under the canyon moon

The world's happy waiting
Doors yellow, broken, blue
I heard Jenny saying
"Go get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking back to
A time under the canyon moon

I'll be gone too long from you

Staring at the ceiling
Two weeks and I'll be home
Carry the feeling
Through Paris, all through Rome
And I'm still thinking back to
A time under the canyon moon

I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going home

I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going home

Quick pause in conversation
She plays songs I've never heard
An old lover's hippie music
Pretends not to know the words
And I keep thinking back to
A time under the canyon moon

I'll be gone too long from you

I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going home

I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going home

I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going home

// Treat People With Kindness //

Maybe, we can find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

I've got a good feeling
I'm just takin' it all in
Floating up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the deep end

And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song for us (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And we'll belong

Maybe, we can find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

Given second chances
I don't need all the answers
Feeling good in my skin
I just keep on dancin'

And if we're here long enough
We'll see it's all for us
And we'll belong

Maybe, we can find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

And it's just another day (And it's just another day)
And if our friends all pass away (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay)
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay) Yeah
Hey!
Here we go now

Maybe, we can find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto all of the time
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto all of the time

(All together now!)
Maybe, we can (One more time!) find a place to feel good (Oh yeah!)
And we can treat people with kindness (Just a little bit of kindness!)
Find a place to feel good

// Fine Line //

Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes

I don't want to fight you
And I don't wanna sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her

We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line

Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold

Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you

We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright

We'll be alright
We'll be alright
