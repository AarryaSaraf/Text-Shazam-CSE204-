Don't know where you're laying, just know it's not with me
Don't know what I'd tell you if I passed you on the street

I don't want your sympathy
But you don't know what you do to me
Oh, Anna
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna

Don't know how you taste when there's smoke in your perfume
So chew me up and spit me out, nothing left to lose

I don't want your sympathy
But you don't know what you do to me
Oh, Anna
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna

I don't want your sympathy
But you don't know what you do to me
Oh, Anna
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna

Hope you never hear this and know that it's for you
I don't know what I'd tell you if you asked me for the truth

I don't want your sympathy
But you'll never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna


Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body

I don't want your sympathy
But you'll never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna
