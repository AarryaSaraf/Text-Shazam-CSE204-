You got a new life
Am I bothering you?
Do you wanna talk?

We share the last line
Then we drink the wall
Till we wanna talk

I go round and round
Satellite

Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?

Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?

(Spinning out, waiting for you)

I'm in an LA Mood
I don't wanna talk to you
She said, "Give me a day or two"

I go round and round
Satellite

Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?

Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?

Right here, right here
Spinning out, waiting for you
I'm here, right here
Wishing I could be there for you

Be there for you
Be there for you (For you)
For you
Be there for you

Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in
(Spinning out, waiting)
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here? (Spinning out, waiting for you)

Spinning out, waiting for you (For you) to pull me in (For you)
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?

Spinning out, waiting for you (For you) to pull me in (For you)
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here? (Spinning out, waiting for you)
