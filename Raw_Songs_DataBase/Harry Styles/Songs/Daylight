I'm on the roof
You're in your airplane seat
I was nose bleeding
Looking for life out there
Reading your horoscope
You were just doing cocaine in my kitchen
You never listen
I hope you're missing me by now

If I was a bluebird
I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you

Daylight
You got me cursing the daylight
Daylight
You got me cursing the daylight
Daylight
You've got me calling at all times
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight

Out of New York
I'm on the come down speed
We're on bicycles
Saying there's life out there
You've got the antidote
I'll take one to go, go please
Get the picture
Cut out my middle
You ain't got time for me right now

If I was a bluebird
I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you

Daylight
You've got me calling at all times
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight
Daylight
You got me cursing the daylight
Daylight
You got me cursing the daylight
Daylight
You've got me calling at all times
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight

If I was a blue bird
I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
