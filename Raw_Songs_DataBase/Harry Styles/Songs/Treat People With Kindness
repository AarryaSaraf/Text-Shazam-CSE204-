Maybe, we can find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

I've got a good feeling
I'm just takin' it all in
Floating up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the deep end

And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song for us (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And we'll belong

Maybe, we can find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

Given second chances
I don't need all the answers
Feeling good in my skin
I just keep on dancin'

And if we're here long enough
We'll see it's all for us
And we'll belong

Maybe, we can find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

And it's just another day (And it's just another day)
And if our friends all pass away (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay)
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay) Yeah
Hey!
Here we go now

Maybe, we can find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto all of the time
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto all of the time

(All together now!)
Maybe, we can (One more time!) find a place to feel good (Oh yeah!)
And we can treat people with kindness (Just a little bit of kindness!)
Find a place to feel good
