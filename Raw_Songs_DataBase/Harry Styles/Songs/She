9 in the morning
The man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you
Like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32
Like he knows what to do

She
She lives in daydreams with me
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is

He takes a boat out
Imagines just sailing away (Away, away)
And not telling his mates (Not telling his mates)
He wouldn't know what to say (Wouldn't know what to say, to say)

She
She lives in daydreams with me
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is

She
She's the first one that I see
She lives in daydreams with me
And I don't know why
I don't know where she is

Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head
And she sleeps in his bed
While he plays pretend
So pretend

She
She lives in daydreams with me
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is

She
She's the first one that I see
She lives in daydreams with me
And I don't know why
I don't know where she is
