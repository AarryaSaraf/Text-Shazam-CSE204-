Should we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?

(la la la la la la la)

I'm selfish, I know
But I don't ever want to see you with him
I'm selfish, I know
I told you, but I know you never listen

I hope you can see, the shape that I'm in
While he's touching your skin
He's right where I should, where I should be
But you're making me bleed

Tempted, you know
Apologies are never gonna fix this
I'm empty, I know
Promises are broken like a stitch is

I hope you can see, the shape I've been in
While he's touching your skin
This thing upon me, howls like a beast
You flower, you feast
