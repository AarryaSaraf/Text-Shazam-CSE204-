Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows
Damn your love
Damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

If you don't love me now
Never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Running in the shadows
Damn your love
Damn your lies

Break the silence
Damn the dark
Damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

If you don't love me now
Never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
If you don't love me now
Never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together
Running in the shadows
Chain, keep us together
Running in the shadows
Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together
