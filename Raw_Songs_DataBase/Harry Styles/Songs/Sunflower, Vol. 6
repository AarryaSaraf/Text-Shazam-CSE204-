Sunflower
Sunflower
My eyes
Want you more than a melody
Let me inside
Wish I could get to know you

Sunflowers
Sometimes
Keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied

And I don't wanna make you feel bad, but I've been trying hard not to talk to you
My sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)

I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more tonight

Wondering headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouth full of toothpaste
Before I got to know you

I've got your face
Hung up high in the gallery
Out of this shade (Sunflower, sunflower)

Your flowers just died
Plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you
I don't wanna make you feel bad, but I've been trying hard not to act a fool
My sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)

I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more tonight
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the kitchen listen to dance hall
I couldn't want you any more tonight

Sunflower
My eyes
Want you more than a melody
Let me inside
Wish I could get to know you

Sunflowers just died
Keep it sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower
