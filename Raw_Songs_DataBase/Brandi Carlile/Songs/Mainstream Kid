I'm gonna to fit in
I'm on the list
I'm gonna to get in
Haven't you heard
Don't you know who I am
I'm with the Joneses
I'm their best friend

I came to saturate the market
To perpetuate the hip kid
I was born so I could fall in line
I'm a legend in my own mind
Can I blend in with your kind?

I need you to liberate me
You the masses educate me
Hold my fist into the air
Declare a social victory

You can own me, you control me
Individuality has never stood a chance against you
Jump into the mainstream

Your revolution
gets in the way of my confusion
I need someone to tell me who I am
To keep me under this illusion

I came to separate the classes
To place the fails above the passes
And there has never been a better time to set the bar beneath the masses
Can I blend in with your kind?

I need you to liberate me
You the masses educate me
Hold my fist into the air
Declare a social victory

You can own me, you control me
Individuality has never stood a chance against you
Jump into the mainstream

I need you to liberate me
You the masses educate me
Hold my fist into the air
Declare a social victory

You can own me, you control me
Individuality has never stood a chance against you
Jump into the mainstream

Your revolution
Into the mainstream kid
Your revolution
Into the mainstream
Your revolution
Into the mainstream kid
Your revolution
Into the mainstream

Jump into the mainstream kid
