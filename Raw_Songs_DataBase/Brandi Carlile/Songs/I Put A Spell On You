I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop the things you do, I tell ya I ain't lyin'
I ain't lyin'
You know I can't stand it
You runnin' around
I can't stand it
The way you put me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Because you're mine

Click Click Boom down the rabbit hole here we go
A whole generation livin' the Truman Show
With no control over the feed we see
Feeding humanity to the machinery
Not only selling ads, they're selling you and me
While slowly hacking our psychology
Tracking what we want to see, who we want to be
Praying on our fragile vanity

The symptoms of oppressive algorithms
Seen in schisms in society
When we're givin' into hidden rhythms
Ridden with the heartbeat of conspiracy
They said the hell with us, they put a spell on us
The greatest trick played on humanity
Is the true price of free our shared reality?

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
I put a spell on you
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
