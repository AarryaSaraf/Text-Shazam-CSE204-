I've been gone for so long
And how I missed you
My heart was aching for home
And then one night as I lay down
Somewhere far from you
I dreamt that I heard you call my name
But my mind was playing games

I knew right then that I'd return
To where I was before
And I was so tired of being away
That I just couldn't stay anymore
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?

I thought if I showed up in the night
In my best disguise
There at your doorway in your porch light
That you would look into my eyes
And you would realize who I am
Put your arms around me
You gonna love me so much more
Than you ever did before
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?

It wasn't too long before
I showed up at your door
I'd been gone a thousand miles
I didn't know how much more I could stand
If I could stand at all
You said I looked like I'd been through World War II
And my soul was worn right through
I thought you would read my mind
I thought you'd ask me to stay
You'd never turn me away like before
But you closed your door anyway
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
