Some rights and some wrongs
Some heroes and songs
Are much better left unsolved
Between fiction and fact
Illusion and pact
Where we've been into what we've become
Although we have changed
We're never estranged
And there's nothing I'd trade from before
I love you my friend - my dear means to an end
But you're not in my dreams anymore.

I'll never ally
All the voices goodbye
To the magical mystery tour.
Keep the tears that I cried
In my youth and my pride
And the sorrow like never before.
I've got thank you's and smiles
And affection for miles
And I always will look unto you
You held open the door
For who I'm sent here for
To come in and make my dreams come true.
Although it was sad
And it hurt 'cause it had to
There's nothing I'd change from before.
I love you my friend - my dear means to an end
But you're not in my dreams anymore.

Although it was sad
And it hurt really bad
There's nothing I'd change from before
I love you my friend - my dear means to an end
But you're not in my dreams anymore.

You're not in my dreams anymore.
