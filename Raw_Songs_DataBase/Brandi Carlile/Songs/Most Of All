I haven't seen my father in some time
But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms
And my colors change like the sea
But I don't worry much about time lost
Cause I'm not gunning for the dreams I couldn't find
He told me how to walk the best that I can
On the road I left behind

And most of all
He taught me to forgive
How to keep a cool head
How to love the one you're with
And when I'm falling through the distance
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love

I haven't heard my mother's voice in a while
But her words are always falling out my mouth
My mind and spirit are at odds sometimes
And they fight like the north and the south
But I still care enough about the way
Of the heaviness through which my heart is tethered
She taught me how to be strong in saying goodbye
And that love is forever

But most of all
She taught me how to fight
How to move across the line
Between the wrong and the right
And when I'm turned out in the darkness
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love

Give your love away
When you give your love away
Just remember what comes back to you
Give your love away
When you give your love away
And remember what comes back to you

I haven't seen my father in some time
But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms
And my colors change like the sea
