I went out looking for the answers and never left my town.

I'm no good at understanding, but I'm good at standing ground.
And when I asked a corner preacher I couldn't hear him for my
youth. Some people get religion some people get the truth. I
never get the truth, I never get the truth.

I know the darkness pulls on you. And it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your
heart can break in two, someone loves you.

I lay this suitcase on my chest so I can feel somebody's weight.
And I lay you to rest just to feel a give and take?
I got a new interpretation and it's a better point of view, you
were looking for a landslide I was looking out for you, I was
looking out for you, someone's looking out for you

I know the darkness pulls on you. And it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your
heart can break in two, someone loves you.

I am afraid of crossing lines. I am afraid of flying blind.
Afraid of inquiring minds. Afraid of being left behind.

I close my eyes I think of you, I take a step I think of you,
I catch my breath I think of you, I cannot rest I think of you

My one and only wrecking ball, and you're crashing through my
walls. When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and
when you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like
your heart could break in two, someone loves you.
