Last night I had the exact same dream as you
I killed a bird to save your life
And you gave me your shoes
You said clip my wings and walk my miles
And I said I would too
Then I woke up but I wasn't gonna tell you

Today I sang the same damn tune as you
It was "lady in red" I hate that song
And I know you do too
You didn't catch me singin' along
But I always sing with you
Nice and quietly cuz I don't want to stop you

I know I could be spending a little too much time with you
But time and too much don't belong together like we do
If I had all my yesterdays I'd give 'em to you too
I belong to you now
I belong to you

I see the world the exact same way that you do
We lend our hands and take our stance
In tandem when we do
But I lied and said I knew the way
I hid my eyes from you
I still don't know why I probably didn't want to scare you

I know I could be spending a little too much time with you
But time and too much don't belong together like we do
If I had all my yesterdays I'd give 'em to you too
I belong to you now
I belong to you

I'm gonna die the exact same day as you
On the Golden Gate Bridge I'll hold your hand
And howl at the moon
Scrape the sky with tired eyes
And I will come find you
And I ain't scare cuz I'm never gonna miss you

I belong to you now
I belong to you 
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
