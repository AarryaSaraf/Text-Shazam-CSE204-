My grandpa gave me a wheat penny and I kept it in my pocket
Had big plans in my backyard to build me a space rocket
Talked to my brother on a fake CB that I made from a tic-tac box
Packed my snowballs nice and tight and in the middle I put rocks

Don't trade in your tic-tac box for a ball on the end of the chain
And don't go spending grandpa's pennies buying into the game
You gotta keep your heart young
Don't go growin' old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young

Dad took the wheels off of my bike and he pushed me down a hill
But speed got the best of me and I took my first spill
That was back when alcohol was only used on cuts
Stung like hell so I jerked my leg and mama said it would give me guts

Don't trade in your tic-tac box for a ball on the end of the chain
And don't go spending grandpa's pennies buying into the game
You gotta keep your heart young
Don't go growing old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young

So take a picture of the one you love and put it in a locket
Go dig up your time capsule and the blueprints for your rocket
Keep in touch on a fake CB and that same old tic-tac box
Pack your snowballs a little less tight but in the middle: still put rocks

And keep your heart young
Don't go growing old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young

You gotta keep your heart young
Sometimes you don't die quick
Just like you wished you'd done
The love is a loaded gun
You've gotta keep your heart young
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young
