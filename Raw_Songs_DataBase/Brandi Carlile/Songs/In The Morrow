I found myself today 
I took my cross up and walked away 
With amazing grace and open eyes 
Even though I'm born to lose my way 
Tomorrow comes on a hurricane 
When the weight of the world is on your mind 

In the morrow I'll be gone 
I gave it everything I had for so long 
Save your sorrow for your song 
Don't we always find a way to carry on 

No one sees it coming 
And no one walks when they should've been running 
Nothing hurts like knowing you tried 
And we can see how years can slip away 
In the cold dark nights and the long hard days 
But nothing aches quite like goodbye 

In the morrow I'll be gone 
I gave it everything I had for so long 
Save your sorrow for your song 
Don't we always find a way to carry on 

In the morrow I'll be gone 
I gave it everything I had for so long 
Save your sorrow for your song 
Don't we always find a way 

In the morrow I'll be gone 
I gave it everything I had for so long 
Save your sorrow for your song 
Don't we always find a way to carry on 
Don't we always find a way to carry on
