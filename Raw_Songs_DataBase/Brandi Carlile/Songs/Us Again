Close your eyes and count to three
I'm gonna make you proud of me
not today, but that's alright
we have got a long long time

I've got big plans and you do too
and we've got ways to make them true
when I get old and if I do
I'm gonna get there next to you

And you can count on me
and you can lean on me
and we can throw our dreams to the wind
they'll find us again

With a hand to hold the rail
count the years that we've got left
we've got the world by the tail
oh we just don't know it yet

But you can count on me
and you can lean on me
and we can throw our dreams to the wind

And you can count on me
and you can lean on me
and we can throw our dreams to the wind
they'll find us again
they'll find us again
they'll find us again
