Way back when, when the days were young
We had our fun
Never cared much about being cool
Or growing old to play the old fool
Part of your life you spend paying your dues
Walking the miles and singing the blues
If I'm born into a pair of ramblin' shoes
I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll take my wings with a heart that's true
And find the way to you
Part of your life you spend paying your dues
Walking the miles in your old man shoes
When I finally find the way to shake loose
I'll tell you what I'll do
Hang my worry on a golden noose
And find the way to you
When we're all old and withering sages
Talkin' 'bout what might have been
Like a missing line or torn out pages
We're gonna miss you then
Walking the miles, singing the blues
Learning to love what god gives to you
If he gave me rockets on the bottom of my shoes
I tell you what I'd do
I'd burn my sole where the sun was new
And find the way
The way to you
