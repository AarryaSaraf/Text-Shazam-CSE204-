I have a voice
Started out a whisper, turned into a scream
Made a beautiful noise
Shoulder to shoulder, marching in the street
When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze
But when you band together, it's a choir
Of thunder and rain
Now we have a choice
'Cause I have a voice

I'm not living to die
Don't stand in a wasteland
Look at me in the eye
Stop living a lie
And stand up next to me
You've got to put one foot in front of another
With a hand in a hand holding on to each other
Go on and rejoice
'Cause you have a voice

It is loud, it is clear
It's stronger than your fear
It's believing you belong
It's calling out the wrong
From the silence of my sisters
To the violence of my brother
We can, we can rage
Against the river
Feel the pain of another
I have a voice

I have a voice
And I let it speak for the ones who aren't yet running free
It's killing me
No one's saying what we need to hear
I will not let silence win
When I see all the pain our people are in
There's no other choice
'Cause I have a voice

It is loud, it is clear
It's stronger than your fear
It's believing you belong
It's for calling out the wrong
From the mouths of our mothers
To the lips of our daughters
We can, we can dream
Like our brothers speaking loud like our fathers
We can, we can heal
Can you hear us?
Can you hear us now?

I have a voice
Started out a whisper, turned into a scream
Made a beautiful noise
Shoulder to shoulder, marching in the street
When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze
When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze
But when you band together, it's a choir
Of thunder and rain
Now we have a choice
'Cause I have a voice

Now we have a choice
'Cause I have a voice

Now we have a choice

'Cause I have a voice
