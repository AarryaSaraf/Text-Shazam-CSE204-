Come back now, even if you call me out
You might be angry now of course you are
I'm scared too, didn't mean to take it out on you
I know I always do, you're the strongest person in the room
Turn back time, help me to rewind and we can
Find ourselves again

It's not too late
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time

Don't look down
I can feel it when your heart starts pounding
It's beyond your control, you know it is
It's getting to the point where I can't carry on
I never held my breath for quite this long
And I don't take it back, I did what I had to do

It's not too late
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time

It's not too late
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time
