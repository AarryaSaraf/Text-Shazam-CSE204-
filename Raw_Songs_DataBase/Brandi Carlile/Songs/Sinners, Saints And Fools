Where the winds of change were blowin', there lived a God-fearing man
He was turning through his Bible when he came up with a plan
He painted up a sign and held it high above his head
Waved it proudly in the air and this is what it read

You can't break the law
There are reasons for the rules
They keep things safe here for everyone
The Sinners, Saints, and Fools
The poor and huddled masses
Who are hungry and afraid
You gotta do it by the book and there'll be
No exceptions made

To the weary, desperate souls who washed up on the sand
He said, "We haven't seen your paperwork" and he withdrew his hand
You know he never felt any safer, or the peace he hoped he'd find
And up until the day he died, he never changed his mind

You can't break the law
There are reasons for the rules
We gotta keep things safe here for everyone
The Sinners, Saints, and Fools
To the poor and huddled masses
Who are hungry and afraid
You gotta do it by the book and there'll be
No exceptions made

By the time he got to Heaven, it was surrounded by a wall
The pearly gates were locked up tight, the golden chains and all
They said, "We cannot let just anyone walk in here anymore
You didn't do it by the book," and then they pointed to the floor

You can't break the law
There are reasons for the rules
They keep things safe here for everyone
You Sinners, Saints, and Fools
To the poor and huddled masses
Who are hungry and afraid
You gotta do it by the book and there'll be
No exceptions made

No
