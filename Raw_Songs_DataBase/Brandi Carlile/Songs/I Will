It's not the end of the world, it's not even over
But it will be soon I never learned my lesson
I just changed my tune and no one seems to notice
But you will, you will

It's no big deal
But the last thing I think of when I close my eyes
And the first thing on my mind when I arise
It is a day and you're not really in my life

You can try and you won't find it where you're looking
You can hold it till it's putty in your hands
And you can't break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
And I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will

You're not fooling me
I'm not the sort of girl that can't see reason
But it's nothing that a little bit of time won't heal
I know it don't come easy but I love you, I do

Coming clean
Means never closing curtains I just changed my scene
Oh but you know what I mean and I will learn throughout my life
To never believe what will have been

I can try and I wont find it where im looking
I can hold it till it's putty in my hands
You can't break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
But I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will

I don't think you ever learned a thing from me
But I'm sure that you want me to learn from you
And you've drawn heavy-handed lines around morality
About yourself and I don't share your point of view

It's about time to let you go and I thought it's time to let you know
And it has to be the one that you'd regret
I have to say that I'm proud to know you
And I'll never be the same because we met
You might not miss this I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, i will, i will
I will, i will, i will
