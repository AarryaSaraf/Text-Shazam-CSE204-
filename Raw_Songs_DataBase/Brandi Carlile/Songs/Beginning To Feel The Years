You carry me along with you
Keep my spirit strong you do
Maybe I was meant to be
under your lock and key

The hard times that I had
Really don't seem all that bad
Yesterday is long ago and far away

And I'm beginning to feel the years
but I'm going to be ok
as long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
and into the morning light

There are things that I've said before
I don't mean them anymore
Yesterday is long ago and far away

And I'm beginning to feel the years
but I'm going to be ok
as long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
and into the morning light

With angels by your side
The spirit's there to guide

I'm beginning to feel the years
but I'm going to be ok
as long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
and into the morning light
