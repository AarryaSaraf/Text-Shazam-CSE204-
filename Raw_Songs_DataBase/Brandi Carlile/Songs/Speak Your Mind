Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

There is no greater tool that you have than your voice
And nothing can take it away
You can use it for justice or the freedom of choice
Let no one dictate what you say

Speak your mind, you're not too young, you know
The future's in your hands
No religion man or leader
Can keep you from this stand
Of all the wonders, both natural and built
Skyscrapers to mountain peaks
Yeah, none are permitted to silence, you hear
Long live the freedom of speech

Ah-ah-ah

There's a light that shines in the darkness
Let nothing be hidden away
For the power belongs to the people
When there's truth in the words that we say

Give me critics and writers, reporters
Take a hit and open your eyes
Yeah, knowledge is power and the freedom of press
Is the power without taking sides

Speak your mind, you're not too young, you know
The future's in your hands
No religion man or leader
Can keep you from this stand
Of all the wonders, both natural and built
And oceans from the east to the west
Yeah, nothing can stop you from pushing the pen
Awh, this is the freedom of press

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

We have heard that there's strength in our numbers
Where we gather our voices are loud
Use the right that you have to assemble
In a peaceful and powerful crowd

We have all heard of walls and division
We should always chose love over hate
There is only one wall built with wisdom
It's the the wall between church and the state

Speak your mind, you're not too young, you know
The future's in your hands
No religion man or leader
Can keep you from this stand
We can always take care of our neighbors
We should gather, report, and be kind
Remember no one can silence the masses
No one can speak you from speaking your mind

Yeah, no one can silence the masses
No one can speak you from speaking your mind

Ah-ah-ah
