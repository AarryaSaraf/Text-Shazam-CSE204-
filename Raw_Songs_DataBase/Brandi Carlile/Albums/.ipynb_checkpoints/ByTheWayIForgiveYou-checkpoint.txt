Album: ByTheWayIForgiveYou

// Every Time I Hear That Song //

A love song was playing on the radio
It made me kind of sad because it made me think of you
And I wonder how you're doing but I wish I didn't care
Because I gave you all I had and got the worst of you

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)

And didn't it break your heart when you watched my smile fading
Did it ever cross your mind that one day the tables would be turned
They told me the best revenge would be a life well lived
And the strongest one that holds would be the hardest one to earn

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)

When I woke up in the morning I was choking on some words
There were things unsaid between us, there were things you never told
Now that's twice you broke my heart now, the first was way back then
And to know that you're still unhappy only makes it break again

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine

By the way, I forgive you
I never will, never will forget you
For giving me what I've found
Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)

// The Joke //

You're feeling nervous, aren't you, boy?
With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt in your face
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts

Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them

You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
We gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared

Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them

Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them

// Hold Out Your Hand //

I run a lot of miles of life and crime
Of mountain climbs and quittin' times
Packing that load of lyin' rhymes
And tired jokes and wooden dimes
I've been everybody's friend, everybody's friend

I could lose my house, I could steal a car
I could serve two masters, living hard
Living like a dog in a cage in the hole
With a fist full of cold hard cash and I can't let go
The devil can't have my soul, the devil can't get your soul
The devil can't get your soul

Hold out your hand
Take hold of mine now
Round and round we go
Don't you wanna dance
I'm a dying man
From the moment we began
Hold out your hand
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

The hand comes around and the trumpet sounds
And his number calls and the moment he falls
And the haunted halls of man he will understand
He will comprehend, he will not pretend
He will not pretend

When the rain don't fall and the river don't run
And the wind takes orders from the blazing sun
The devil don't break with a fiery snake
And you handled about goddamn much as you can take
The devil don't take a break, the devil don't take a break
The devil don't take no break

Hold out your hand
Take hold of mine now
Round and round we go
Don't you wanna dance
I'm a dying man
From the moment we began
Hold out your hand
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

Well it came to my door, there's so many feuds
Of games and bullets and tensions to heal
A lust for killing, your old man and son
For a careless mistake and a fight lost to God!
(Come on!)
To leave your brother for father's grief
For the mountains, lay down, or you'll faint like a sea
When all is covered silver and light
Any color and light but you know you wanna fight!
What a glorious sight!
What a glorious sight!
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

Hold out your hand (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Take hold of mine now (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Round and round we go (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Don't you wanna dance (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
I'm a dying man (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
From the moment we began (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Hold out your hand (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

// The Mother //

Welcome to the end of being alone inside your mind
Tethered to another and you're worried all the time
You always knew the melody but you never heard it rhyme

She's fair and she is quiet, Lord, she doesn't look like me
She made me love the morning, she's a holiday at sea
The New York streets are as busy as they always used to be
But I am the mother of Evangeline

The first things that she took from me were selfishness and sleep
She broke a thousand heirlooms I was never meant to keep
She filled my life with color, cancelled plans and trashed my car
But none of that is ever who we are

Outside of my windows are the mountains and the snow
I hold you while you're sleeping and I wish that I could go
All my rowdy friends are out accomplishing their dreams
But I am the mother of Evangeline

They've still got their morning paper and their coffee and their time
They still enjoy their evenings with the skeptics and their wine
Oh but all the wonders I have seen I will see a second time
From inside of the ages through your eyes

You were not an accident where no one thought it through
The world has stood against us, made us mean to fight for you
And when we chose your name we knew that you'd fight the power, too

You're nothing short of magical and beautiful to me
I would never hit the big time without you
So they can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine
Cause I am the mother of Evangeline

They can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine
Cause I am the mother of Evangeline
Ooooh...

// Whatever You Do //

If I don't owe you a favor, you don't know me
I don't believe we've ever even met
If there's a God in heaven you can show me
Then I guess I should admit I lost the bet
There are moments I could hold you forever
There are moments that lasted way too long
There are days when I change with the weather
To hold you in place would be wrong

There's a road left behind me that I would rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live too

I never met a morning I could get through
With nothing on my breath to hold the night
And I never said I'm sorry but I meant to
I never met a coward I don't like
There are reasons why the body stays in motion
But at the moment only demons come to mine
There are days when I could walk into the ocean
With no one else but you to leave behind

There's a road left behind me that I would rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live too

There's a road left behind me that I would rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live too

// Fulton County Jane Doe //

1, 2, 3, 4...

Out in the middle of nowhere
With nothing much else to do
Oh, the night brought us together
And I lent my heart to you

Maybe you were running way from something
Without so much as a plan
Not a living soul to guide you
Jesus tattooed on your hand

God, the whole world's gone crazy
And there's only God to blame
Somebody called you something sweet once
It was more than Fulton County Jane

And when my heart has no rest
And a thousand things are on my mind
I'll always save some room for you
I won't let you get left behind

Oh, and I always will remember
When the lonely day is through
That somewhere fall from Fulton County
A stranger says a prayer for you

God, the whole world's gone crazy
And there's only God to blame
Your mother calls you something sweet once
It was more than Fulton County Jane
Fulton County Jane

We came into this life with nothing
And all we're taking is a name
That's why I've written you this song
This is for Fulton County Jane

God, the whole world's gone crazy
And there's only God to blame
Your mother calls you something sweet once, darling
You're more than Fulton County, Fulton County Jane
Fulton County Jane

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

// Sugartooth //

He wasn't really known for breaking the rules
When he arrived in the second year of my high school
He wasn't so much of a twist of fate
As a short turn up from a Southern state
He was born with a sweet tooth he couldn't beat
Always trying to find himself something sweet
All that he found was a trouble and me
Or maybe trouble just found him

It was hard to hide that his heart had scars
He would stay up late talking to the stars
People tried to blame him for making bad choices
When he was only listening to the voices
He's searching for some kind of deeper truth
Between the lines in the Bible and living proof
There's no point now to judge him in vain
If you haven't been there, you don't know the pain

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil, stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

His life became more than he could take
He found a bad habit he couldn't break
Nothing could tame him and nothing could hold him
He only took the pills when the doctor told him
Looking too hard for the something sweet
To make his life feel less incomplete
What in the hell are you going to do
When the world has made its mind up about you?

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil, stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

He wanted to be a better man
Then life kicked him down like an old tin can
He would give you the shirt on his back
If not for a sugartooth

They found him lying on his bed
With a gun in his hand and a quiet head
His broken heart now is finally gone
But I know that he had the hurt for too long
To think he had fought it all on his own
Just to lose the battle and die alone
After so many years of feeling the loss
He finally made his way back home

And I helped put what was left in a box
And took it to a place called Jesus Rock
And scattered him all over the jagged mound
As a symbol to all that the peace had been found
But not for a sign is left behind
With a hand stuck reaching back in time
To a place in which you can never unwind
I hope he found something so sweet

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil, stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

He wanted to be a better man
But life kicked him down like an old tin can
He would give you the shirt on his back
If not for a sugartooth

Ooh, ooh hoo ooh
Ooh, a slave to a sugartooth
Ooh, ooh hoo ooh
Ooh, a slave to a sugartooth
Ooh, ooh hoo ooh
Ooh, a slave to a sugartooth
Ooh, ooh hoo ooh
Ooh, a slave to a sugartooth

// Most Of All //

I haven't seen my father in some time
But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms
And my colors change like the sea
But I don't worry much about time lost
Cause I'm not gunning for the dreams I couldn't find
He told me how to walk the best that I can
On the road I left behind

And most of all
He taught me to forgive
How to keep a cool head
How to love the one you're with
And when I'm falling through the distance
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love

I haven't heard my mother's voice in a while
But her words are always falling out my mouth
My mind and spirit are at odds sometimes
And they fight like the north and the south
But I still care enough about the way
Of the heaviness through which my heart is tethered
She taught me how to be strong in saying goodbye
And that love is forever

But most of all
She taught me how to fight
How to move across the line
Between the wrong and the right
And when I'm turned out in the darkness
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love

Give your love away
When you give your love away
Just remember what comes back to you
Give your love away
When you give your love away
And remember what comes back to you

I haven't seen my father in some time
But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms
And my colors change like the sea

// Harder To Forgive //

I love the songs I hated when I was young
Because they take me back where I come from
When every broken heart seemed like the end
When everyone was someone different then

But I can't be alone in a crowded room
Where my thoughts, they run like water down a flume
There are days when I will let the darkness rise
I don't always choose to stay on the sunny side

Sometimes I pretend we never met (ooh)
Because it's harder to forgive than to forget
Sometimes it's harder to forgive

Yes, my life has seen some wasted time
I have suffered for the peace inside my mind
And some things are better left unsaid
While some things work out different when they're in your head

But I'm not sorry for the things I say
Sometimes I let my mouth just run away
And I believe that all souls are born kind
And that all love lost comes back in time

Sometimes I pretend we never met (ooh)
Because it's harder to forgive than to forget
Sometimes it's harder to forgive

And even if the world is really round
And all the maps are painted upside down
So if you stand in one place for too long
Everything around you will be gone
Well, I'm not gonna miss you when I'm gone
Now the part of me that's left wants you to know
That I'm not gonna jump towards the light
The ones who believe choose life

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah
