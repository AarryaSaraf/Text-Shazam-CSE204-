// Until I Die //

Hey there what's that in your sky
With all the pretty lights
You think I can get that high?

Hey you man, where's your motivation
And why the celebration
You've gotten nothing done here

You wanna live until you
Die alone and will
And I can fly alone and will
I'm not so far below
I live beneath your sky
With tainted eyes,
I've made my mind
To live until I die

Run run run catch me if you can can can
Come and hold my hand and I'll be your biggest fan
Followers living in your hollow words
I have seen your nine to fives
Wash away your dreams

You wanna live until you
Die alone and will
And I can fly alone and will
I'm not so far below
I live beneath your sky
With tainted eyes,
I've made my mind
Hey I'm just fine with all my time
To live until I die

// Turpentine //

I watch you grow away from me in photographs
And memories like spies
And salt betrays my eyes again
I started losing sleep and gaining weight
And wishing I was was ten again
So I could be your friend again

These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up

I heard you found some pretty words to say
You found your little game to play
And there's no one allowed in
Then just when we believe we could be great
Reality it permeates
And conquers from within again

These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time 
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up

We're OK I know we're OK
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up

// Wasted //

If you had eyes like golden crowns and
diamonds in your fingertips you'd waste it
If shining wisdom passed your lips and
traveled to the ears of God you'd waste it
And so I hate that you're overrated most
revered and celebrated because you'll waste it

Then again it's good to get a call
Now and then just to say hello
Have I said I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go

But ever time you close a door and nothing
opens in its place you've wasted
And when you speak the words you know
to those who know the words themselves
you're wasted
You're such a classic waste of cool, so afraid to
break the rules in all the wrong places

Then again it's good to get a call
Now and then just to say hello
Have I said I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go

// Again Today //

Broken sticks and broken stones
Will turn to dust just like our bones
It's words that hurt the most now isn't it
Are you sad inside, are you home alone
If I could just pick up the phone
Maybe you could see a better day
And you won't waste away
under my watchful eye
Because I'm your hero and you're my weakness

Who's gonna break my fall
When the spinning starts
The colors bleed together and fade
Was it ever there at all
Or have I lost my way
The path of least resistance
Is catching up with me again today

I'm broken down, not good enough
The broken promises add up
To twice their weight in tears which I have caused

I'm afraid to sink, I'm afraid to swim
I'm sad to say I miss my friends
I know that I'm supposed to step away
But they need me to stay and keep a watchful eye
On all my heroes and all their demons

But who's gonna break my fall
When the spinning starts
The colors bleed together and fade
Was it ever there at all
Or have I lost my way
The path of least resistance
Is catching up with me again
Not today
Not today

Was it ever there at all
And have I lost my way
The path of least resistance
Is catching up with me again today

Broken sticks and broken stones
Will turn to dust just like our bones again today
I'm broken down
Not good enough
The broken promises add up again today

Was it ever there at all
And have I lost my way
The path of least resistance
Is catching up with me again today
Again today

// Late Morning Lullaby //

As soon as my eyes shut the slide show begins
Yesterday is gone now and panic sets in
With a weight upon my chest
and a ghost upon my back
And the numbing sensation of everything
I lack that leaves me
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming,
Your real world away

And beautiful, o beautiful bright eyes, lie
Only beautiful, o beautiful bright eyes cry
Singing late morning lullaby

The first sign of morning is gray and alarming
It's so disappointing the day has come so soon
While the rest of the world greets the day and feels new
I will push it away just like I always do, I will be
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming,
Your real world away

And beautiful, o beautiful bright eyes, lie
Only beautiful, o beautiful bright eyes cry
Singing late morning lullaby
Late morning lullaby

I would darken my window so I can fall asleep
While the critics frown down on the hours
I keep that leave me
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming,
Your real world away

// The Story //

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true, I was made for you

I climbed across the mountain tops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
But baby, I broke them all for you
Oh, because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do, and I was made for you

You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess
No, they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what I've been through like you do
And I was made for you

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
Oh, but these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true, I was made for you

Oh, yeah, well it's true that I was made for you

// My Song //

Everything I do
Surrounds these pieces of my life 
That often change
Or hey, maybe I've changed

Sometimes seeming happy
Can be self-destructive 
Even when you're sane
Yeah you're only insane

But don't bother waking me today

Here I am
I'm so young
I know I've been bitter 
I've been jaded
I'm alone 
Everyday, I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors 
To cut you like a 
Word if only sung

But this is my song
This is my song 

I live everyday
Like they'll never be a last one
Till they're gone
And they're gone
I'm not too proud to beg for 
Your attention and your friendship
And your time
So you could come and get it from now on

Here I am
I'm so young
I know I've been bitter 
I've been jaded
I'm alone 
Everyday, I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors 
To cut you like a 
Word if only sung

This is my song
This is my song

And it's you
It is you

Here I am
I'm so young
I know I've been bitter 
I've been jaded
I'm alone 
Everyday, I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors
I'm not sure I can take it
I've nothing strong to hold to
I'm way too old to hate you
My mind is full of razors
To cut you like a 
Word if only sung

But this is my song

// Have You Ever //

have you ever wandered lonely through the wood?
and everything it feels just as it should
you're part of the life there, part of something good
if you've ever wandered lonely through the woods
ooooh
if you've ever wandered lonely through the woods.

have you ever stared into a starry sky?
lyin on your back you're askin' why?
what's the purpose, I wonder who am I
if you've ever stared into a starry sky
ooooh, aaaah, aaooaaooh
have you ever stared into a starry sky

have you ever been out walking in the snow
tried to get back where you were before
you always end up not knowing where to go
if you've ever been out walking in the snow
ooooh, aaaah, aaooaaooh, ooooh, aaooaaooh
if you'd ever been out walking, you would know

// Josephine //

Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you

Noontime wind can you blow
For me one more time
And take me on back to the start
Where the midnight moon shines so bright
Nearly pulled us up to Heaven
By the strings of our hearts

Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you

Morning sun shine on me
Come light inside my window
And rest on my brow
Kiss my eyes when I sleep
And carry me back home
If my dreams will allow

Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you

Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm dying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you
Someone help me understand why I'm still loving you

// Losing Heart //

I don't mind
If my heart don't beat and
the sun don't shine
They'll get theirs
You'll get yours and I'll get mine
It used to be that everything was easy
Now it's lost and nobody believes me

Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget

I'm alright

Am I made of steel
Am I locked up tight
I'm human
But I'm wide awake and afraid to fight
It used to take nothing to amaze me
But now I'm older and
it doesn't even phase me

Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget

It used to be that everything was easy
Now it's lost and nobody believes me

Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget

// Cannonball //

I was born when I met you
Now I'm dying to forget you
And that is what I know
Though I dreamed I would fall
Like a wounded cannonball
Sinking down with my heart in tow

Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found

There's a man all alone
Telling me his friends are gone
That they've died and flown away
So I told him he was wrong
That you friends are never gone
If you look to the sky and pray

Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found

Someone told me a lie
Someone looked me in the eye
And said time will ease your pain
But behold, when you fall
It's that same old cannonball
Coming back for your heart again

Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
And it may come around
Until the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found

I was born when I met you
Now I'm dying to forget you
And that is what I know

// Downpour //

I'm like the rain in a downpour
I wash away what you long for
And I wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes
I wish I could be there tonight

I'm like the wind in the canyon
I'm there then I'm gone in a second
You're growing older in peace where you're at
I wish I could be there for that
But I've moved on
Like a rolling stone
In a crowded room
I'm alone

I'm like the rain in a downpour
I wash away what you long for
And I wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes
I wish I could be there tonight
Oh, oh, yeah

You're like the tide in the deep blue
Cause you're always there when I need you
And when you need someone to carry you through
I'm gonna be there for you
I'm gonna be there for you

// Shadow On The Wall //

Gone
It's hard for me to see when I'm wrong
It's hard for me to weep when I'm strong
But I could never sleep when you're gone
Oh but still
If you were gonna crucify me
I wouldn't want nobody to see
'Cause you could kick me hard when I'm down
Down, down, down

I don't want wanna be
Nobody's fool
I've played that part so many times before
How I long to be
A shadow on the wall
I will make no sound at all
And when the sun goes down
The shadow on the wall
It cannot be seen at all
At all

Over it
Hey it's not that you would mess with my head
I believe that you believe what you said
You think you know me best and you care
But that's not fair!
'Cause I don't really want to be safe
It must have been the way I was raised
Sleep with one eye open I say
Hey hey hey

I don't wanna be
Nobody's fool
I've played that part so many times before
How I long to be
A shadow on the wall
I will make no sound at all
And when the sun goes down
The shadow on the wall
It cannot be seen at all
At all

Oh
How long to be
A shadow on the wall
I would make no sound at all
At all
