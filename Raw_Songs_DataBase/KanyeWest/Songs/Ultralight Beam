We're on an ultralight beam
We're on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream, this is a God dream
This is everything, this is everything
Ooh, we're on
We're on an ultralight beam
We're on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream, this is a God dream
This is everything, that's it, that's it, this is everything

We're on an ultralight beam
We're on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream, this is a God dream

We're on an ultralight beam
We're on an ultralight beam

Faith
His love is yours
We are saved
He is the risen Lord
We are steppin' out on faith
His love is yours
In the arms of Jesus, saved
He is the risen Lord
We are steppin' out on faith
His love is yours
We are saved
He is the risen Lord

We're on an ultralight beam
We're on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream, this is a God dream
This is everything, this is everything
C'mon, no music all over the building, c'mon sing it
We're on an ultralight beam
We're on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream, this is a God dream
This is everything, yes it is, yes it is, this is everything
