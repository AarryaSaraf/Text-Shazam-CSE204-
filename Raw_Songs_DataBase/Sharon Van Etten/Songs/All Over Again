Doing it all over again
Prove to me
You're some kind of man
And face it
To have some proof of life

Doing it till I feel again
You will never learn
To withstand
To chase it
Try to understand
Where I end

Every one says they understand
Everyone will do what they can
I've seen it
Imagine the time to
Grow

Every hand you had to extend
I was stepping up and you land
To regress
You can't even
Hold your own weight
And I let you
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
