Walking on a cloud of uncertainty
I was something else
Tissues and one hand on my mouse
Waiting for my mom to FaceTime
But then my Wi-Fi cut out

Thinking bout the bad days
And the easy ones
I still feel guilty about
Oh, this cabin fever ain't the same
As when I lived alone

Put my hands
On someone's other line
Hear my voice
Like it was the first time

My tear just dropped
My skin is dry

Another innocent drive
Mysterious time
Another innocent drive
Mysterious time

My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
