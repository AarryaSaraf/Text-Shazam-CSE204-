In the ocean
Waves all around
And they're smashing down
Take my hand, shut your eyes
And hope you remember

You like the position
Watch that change 'fore we drown
We ask ourselves, where we are now
Who we are, what that means

You shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Just like blood
Just like blood

Disappear when the sun goes down
Acid spills as you breathe
Turn around, stare at the wall
Bone to my mouth, and read it out

You shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Just like blood
Just like blood
Just like blood
