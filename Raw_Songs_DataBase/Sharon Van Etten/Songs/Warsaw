You, when you listen
In the color of sorrow
You're over me
You, with eyes through
Leaning forward not giving in wholely
You, you're something
You mean something
Genuinely showing me
Genuinely open to you

Here, sing to yourself
Tell me you want to be shown or
You only listen to an endless sea you want to be over
He is over you
He is over you
I want to be over you
I want to show you
Pull me over you
Arms all over you
I want to show you
I love you silently
