Turn on the charm
Call to response now
Sitting on the porch
Looking for a way out

Touched on me deep
That's why I'm still here
Why do we think that we've no plight?

Even I've taken my chances
Even I've taken my chances on you
Remember?

In the dark
On the way out
It's even enough sounds
It's the combination that takes emotions
Why don't we go now?
No need to think on our own now about it

Even I've taken my chances
Even I've taken my chances on you

When you love all of you, they know all of you
Be alone and take, and you break for your sake
About to leave, about to leave

Even I've taken my chances
Even I've taken my chances on you
