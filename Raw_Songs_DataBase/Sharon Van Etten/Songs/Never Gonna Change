Forever turns into today
Haven't found a way to make it brave
It never goes away
Think I need to step away to say

It never goes away, never goes away
See my son begin to change
Never go away

Deepened in the waves
Sheltered, saw to it don't waste away
Same old thoughts awake
Shame my voice and try to trace the chains

I'm never gonna change, I'm never gonna change
I hear my voice deepens as it pains
Never gonna change, I'm never gonna change
I hear my voice deepens as it pains
Never go away

I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change

Ooh...
