The sun is at stake
And I'm at your window
Beyond all sleep
And I can't speak

In all Tokyo
Translate memories
That I cannot free
But what will it take?

We all make mistakes
We all try to free
The sighs of the past
We don't want to last

Need love erase
To let out my mind
Wanting to love
As new as I can

Wanting to show
I want my scars to help and heal
How much you wanted?
So much you found

Try not to beg
Too much to be
Calling my heart
And know you are real
But my memory steals every moment I can feel
What will it take?

We all make mistakes
Even though I try to stand
Even though it's slowly
I do all I can
But who is my man?

The memory or you?
The love or the due?
To carry a face
I cannot retrace
I do all I can
We all make mistakes
