Where is my love, I sing
What I'll never understand
Something I thought I held
But it fell, it fell
It fell

Oh well as men say
Oh well as men say
I'll hold it again

I sing, I sing, I sing
What I don't understand
Of things I held in my hand that fell
Ooh as the men say
Oh well, does the man say
I'll love again

Where is my love
That I sing
I don't understand
I, thought I held in my hand
But it fell

Ooh, it fell and it fell
Ooh, it fell and it fell
And now I sing ooh well
