You told me the day
That you show me your face
We'd be in trouble for a long time

I can't wait
Til we're afraid
Of nothing
I can't wait
Til we hide
From nothing
Nothing
And you decide
You throw me a lame "wait shit out"
You're a little late
I need you
To be afraid of nothing

Turning my way
You show me your face
We've known each other for a long time

I can't wait
Til we're afraid
Of nothing
I can't wait
Til we hide
From nothing
Nothing
And you decide
You throw me a lame "wait shit out"
You're a little late
I need you
To be afraid of nothing

I need you
To be afraid of nothing
