Rain
Sleep tonight
Sunrise
Hold hands all night

It's been a while since I held you close
Been a while since we've touched
All the doors close
I've seen the fall
I've seen you undone
Been writing on the dust
I'm hearing stars fall
Keeping what at bay?

Here I'm standing
Partly here
Here I stare around the room
Pray home they

I'm looking at our grass
I'm struggling for words
I'm dreaming of a place
I held close in a state
Darkness fades

The nights are now
Better stay, light
I'm looking for a way
Darkness fades
