Where do you always stay? Where do you stare?
When you look, what do you see there?
Come back with your head up
When you barely stand, when you couldn't ask

You, you will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)

You, you will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)

Back, you will stay
You will learn or you will do it again
Will you ever hold your ground? Will I ever pull your teeth?
If you barely stand, how do I let you leave?

You, you will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)

You, you will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)

Standing, I can see
You will learn, you will run
(You will run)
(You will run your will)
(You will run your will)
