Turn me back and you will say
"Here is what you have
Only in the stars you saw
Harmony is all you'll see
And home is what you hold
And what you have to hold is what you wanted"

"Cruel," he said, once
It's always once

All is harmony
It's once, it's all, it's done
And crazy as can be
It's not dark, it's only darkish
Waiting
Tell me this one thing
Calling out to where?
Where will we be when our world is done?
It's done
Darkish inside of me
