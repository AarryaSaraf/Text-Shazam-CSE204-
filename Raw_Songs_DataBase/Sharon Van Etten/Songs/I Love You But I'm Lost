One, two, three

You read the answers by the shadows on the wall
We could be great
Drive myself crazy with mistakes
You know I'm better everyday

Tell me there's something I can change 
Recall I know what a sanctuary is
Help me deserve you, seeing me praise
You love me but you'll change

Disappointed in a lover 
Because there's the only way
To know somebody in and out after a while 
It's all a challenge

Come in here and be yourself again
I love you but I'm not somebody who take shots
See me after I recoil 
I'm better than I know 
There's room to grow

Tear stains on the last page
Better leave 'em
Time will tell and I'll be back
Tear stains I believe that I'm in Houston 
I can read my lines
Most of all I find it strange 
I believe them

Turn me into something great
You know that that's the only way
Promises that we forgot
I suppose that we will always 

Let's turn it into something we can change 
I love you but I'm lost 
Between the pain and cost
I hold myself alive 
I love you but I'm lost 
I love you but I'm lost 
I love you but I'm lost 
I love you but I'm lost 

I love you but I'm lost 
I love that there's no cross
