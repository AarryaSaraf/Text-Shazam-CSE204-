Follow me until you don't know where you are
Follow me until you don't know where you are
Closing your eyes when you're reaching with hands
Falling down flat when you don't understand who I am

You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing wrong
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

Listen until you know what to say
Listen until you know what to say
Use loving words and be gentle and kind
Open your mind and it's easy to find where I am

You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing wrong
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing, no
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

You say that you've changed your mind
Yeah, I let you
Your side isn't on my side, walking east now

You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing wrong
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing wrong
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow
