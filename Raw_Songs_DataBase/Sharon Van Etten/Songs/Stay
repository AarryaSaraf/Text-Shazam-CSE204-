Have you all of my lifetime
Kind hard to make light
Imagining when you're inside
When you make those kicks at night

Don't want to hurt you
Don't want to run away from myself
Want your whole star to shine on in
One star, one light
The meaning of life

You won't let me go astray
You will let me find my way

Find a way to stand
And a time to walk away
Letting go to let you lead
I don't know how it ends

Comes a time when you answer
Do it with heart
Want you to express yourself
Not let it get to your head

You won't let me go astray
You will let me find my way
You, you love me either way
You stay
