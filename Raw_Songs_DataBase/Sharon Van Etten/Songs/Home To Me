The only child, don't turn your back, don't leave
You're on my mind, do you not see?

I need my job, please, don't hold that against me
You are my life, ooh, don't that sting?

Oh, my child, you throw it back to me
You hold my time, you hold right back indeed

I take my time, so you can say to me
"What makes it right is an unknown thing"

You come home to me
You come home to me
You come home to me
You come home to me
You come home to me
