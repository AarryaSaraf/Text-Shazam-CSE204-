I was never like her
I laugh as I am knocked down
Turned your face like I always did
When I was taking my time

I knew where I was born
I knew where I was blamed by the world

Where have you been?
You were with your wishes
What could have been?
If a wish was kisses

One night, I walked into a situation that I could have avoided
But it turned into something my babe noticed ain't right

It was something like a window and I wanted to break free
You showed me a false halo, there will be no walking back
I walk away, my head turned

I wanted to break
Something like an innocent child
Walking by fire
Not another bullet in vain
