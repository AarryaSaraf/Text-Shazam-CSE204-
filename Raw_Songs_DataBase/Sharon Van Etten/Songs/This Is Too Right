This is too right
You have mistaken me for another life
This is too right
You have mistaken me for
Someone you used to like

It's too right, it's too right
It's too right, it's too right

This is too right
My hands are shaking mine
It's like we never met
I'll sleep til 10, til 12 or 2:30
It really just depends

It's too right, it's too right
It's too right, it's too right
It's too right, it's too right
Too right, too right

This is too right
I can count on one hand
Your misconception rights
This is too right
I want to correct you
You call me every time you need rules

It's too right, it's too right
It's too right, it's too right
It's too right, it's too right
Too right, too right
Too right
