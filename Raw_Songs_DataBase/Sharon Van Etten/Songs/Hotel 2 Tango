Tell me why you're leaving
There's a hole in my heart
Thoughts can be deceiving
Am I falling apart?
Should it stops and it starts
Am I breathing?

Turn into the rain
And then I'm walking away
Reaching out to me
When there is nothing to save
What are you doing today?
What are you doing today?

When you go
When you go
Too far
Too much

Everyone is talking
They got nothing to say
Ask me why I'm crying
Why don't you go away?
Tell me when you're gone
When you're gone
Where did you go
When you're gone
Where I go
