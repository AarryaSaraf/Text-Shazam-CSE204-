You're talking too loud
Won't you walk over, whisper, motion hands or bat a lash
You gotta see there's too many eyes

You're walking too fast
Why the hurry, let me pace myself, no need to run a lap
You gotta lead, you gotta lead

You got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime
You got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime

You hear what I say, when you waltz over, whistle
And you're trying to have your way
You gotta see, you felt the same
You're coming today with a hop in your step
You kind of marvel at yourself
You gotta breathe, you gotta breathe

You got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime
You got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime

Cowardice
You felt it yourself
You're telling lies
You said too much
You got nothing to lose, nothing to lose, nothing to lose this time
You got nothing to lose, nothing to lose, nothing to lose this time
You got nothing to lose, nothing to lose, nothing to lose
