Sister don't mind that I'm not on time
She knows that I'm through with that
Sick of trying, don't let mine
Mama's still loving and daddy still loves
They know that I'm here like that
I'm like mine: true and kind

Call me aside and I will now be
And I will be fine with that
Don't leave me now, you might love me back
Distance is fine, I know you can't care
And nothing is big like that
You don't see me now, I don't see you back

One day I'll be fine with that
You don't leave me now
Do you love me back?

Just to remind you I'm a mistake
How come you don't want to know?
You don't wanna see, you don't wanna show
Kicking myself, I know that you're tough
Yeah we can pretend we're that
Gotta see how, you gotta leave that

One day I'll be fine with that
You don't leave me now
Do you love me back?

Snow is outside but I'm by your fire
I feel all the love you'll bring
You gotta see how we can see this out
Summer in mind and spring by your side
You'll see all the love we'll keep
Gotta see that we couldn't be there

One day I'll be fine with that
You don't leave me now
Do you love me back?
