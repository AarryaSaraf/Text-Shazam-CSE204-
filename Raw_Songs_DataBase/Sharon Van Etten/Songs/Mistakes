I walk down the road
Let my body wake up by the way
You'll move
Skate 'round the room
See my body ache, my body shake
Boom, boom

Even when I make a mistake
Even when I make a mistake, mistake, mistake
It's much better than that

I dance like Elaine
But my baby takes me to the floor
Says, "More, more"
Eyes close to stares
My baby takes, my body shares
Lights flare

Even when I make a mistake
Even when I make a mistake, mistake, mistake
It's much better than that

When I make a mistake
Turns out it's great, it's great, it's great
I'm much better than that
It's much better than that

Even when I make a mistake
Even when I make a mistake, mistake
Turns out it's great
Even when you're late, you're late, you're late
It's much better than that
It's much better than that
It's much better than that
