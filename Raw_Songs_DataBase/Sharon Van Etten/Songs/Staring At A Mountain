It hasn't rained for days
Staring at a mountain out of rage
Hear a bird calling, someone's here
To reach inside my pain
Pain

The leaves are turning in my mind
They haven't fallen and I can't feel time
The wind is capturing me, hair is falling
Covering my eyes
Rise
The wind is turning into movement
And then falling out of time
Time

I am so tired I fell right through
I looked into a darkness no one knew
I'm falling further into something
That I cannot understand

But you understand
You understand
You understand
You understand
You understand
You understand
You understand
You understand
