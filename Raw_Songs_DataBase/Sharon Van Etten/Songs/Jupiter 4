Our love's for real
How'd it take a long, long time
To let us feel?
Try to relate
In my state
And the aura 'round me says
"My love is for real"

Touching your face
How'd it take a long, long time
To be here?
Turning the wheel on my street
My heart still skips a beat
It's echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing

Baby, baby, baby
I've been searching for you
I wanted to be in love
Baby, baby, baby
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting
My whole life for someone like you
It's true that everyone would like to have met
A love so real
A love so real

Baby, baby, baby
I've been searching for you
I wanted to be in love
Baby, baby, baby
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting
My whole life for someone like you
It's true that everyone would like to have met
A love so real
A love so real
A love so real
Our love so real
