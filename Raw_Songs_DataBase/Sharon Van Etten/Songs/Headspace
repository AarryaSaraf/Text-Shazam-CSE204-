Eyes on screen to left of me
All the clouds are wrapped around your brain
Hardly see what's next to you
Can't you see I'm trying to get through?

Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby

I want to touch you in the dark
Put your lips on neck to me
Hold yourself up against me
Don't stop
Pull my hips, remind you, see
Ten year old white cotton briefs want play

Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby

I wanted to feel ageless
I wanted to be here
I wanted to feel ageless
I wanted to feel here

Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby
