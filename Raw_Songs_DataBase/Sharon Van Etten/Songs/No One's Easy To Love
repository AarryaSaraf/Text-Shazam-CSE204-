Yes, there were jerks, recalling the years of love's past
As you opened the door and told me how you love me so much
The resistance to feeling something that you put down before
But keep quiet of it as you could not fell fit anymore

Too much has changed, I can't let you walk in in the night
I wish away my love, leave with the dawn
Acting as if all the pain in the world was my fault
Leave me here, my love, don't say goodbye

No one's easy to love
Don't look down, my dear, don't be surprised
No one's easy to love
Don't look back, my dear, just say you tried

There was a question you asked, "Is your father a man?"
Know what I think you should do? Ask of yourself the same
What is the difference between now and then? I'm not sure
Prove me wrong, my dear, don't say I lied

No one's easy to love
Don't look down, my dear, don't be surprised
No one's easy to love
Don't look back, my dear, just say you tried
