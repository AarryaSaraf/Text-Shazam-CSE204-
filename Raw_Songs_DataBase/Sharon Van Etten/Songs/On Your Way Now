She's not heavy, she's your little everything
On our way to the daylight and all it brings

And I don't mind at all
No, I don't mind at all
(Okay, just a little bit)

On your way, now
On your way, now

She's no trouble, she can travel here with me
I'll share all that I am, and that's a guarantee

And I don't mind at all
No I don't mind at all
(Well okay, just a little bit)

On your way, now
On your way, now

Go on, hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
