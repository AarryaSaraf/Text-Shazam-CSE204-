Chained to the wall of our room
Yeah you chained me like a dog in our
Iiiii thought that's how it was
I thought that we were fine
Then the day was night
You were high, you were high
While I was doomed
And dyin' for
With no life,
With no light.

Tied to my bed,
I was younger then, I had nothing to spend
Time on you
But it made me love,
It made me love,
It made me love more... 

Do what you said, the words she said - "left out"
Over into the sky where I'll soon fly
And she took the time
To believe in, to believe in
What she said...

She made me love,
She made me love,
She made me looove more...
