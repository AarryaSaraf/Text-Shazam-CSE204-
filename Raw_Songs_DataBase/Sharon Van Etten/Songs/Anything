Up the whole night
Undefined
Can't stop thinking 'bout peace and war
Up the whole night
Right before
The sun takes everything
It could've been anything
I didn't feel anything

Up the whole night
Underline
Chain-smoking, like, no, it ain't right
Afternoon beer
Understand
It could've been anything
It could've been anything
I didn't feel anything

You love him by the stove light in your arms
He is there because he can't stand the sad eyes

I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything
