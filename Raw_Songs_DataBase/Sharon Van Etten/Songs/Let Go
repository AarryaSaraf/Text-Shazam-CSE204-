Brother's smile
Taking on its own
Identity
Only to then leave it behind

Foreign light in the afternoon

Held by what-be-nots
Stay until remembered
Here I'm standing
Ripped apart by albatross
Hanging by a thread

What's in a name?
What's in a name?

Down on the other side
I'm almost out of sight
Looking up to let go
Now I'm letting go
Now I'm letting go
Now I'm letting go

Let it go (Let him go)
Let it go (Let him go)
Let it go (Let him go)
Let it go (Let him go)
...
