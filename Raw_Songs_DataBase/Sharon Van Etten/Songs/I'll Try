My hell in drive
My heart in, like, a fog
I hear them now
Every time I cross the park
Believe the death
Karma, your life
Come what fear undone
My life on the path

Don't state a direction
Like who my blood won't save
Anyone on a mission
To fear a life, no love
It crossed my mind
I'd "try"
Let's go march
I'll go downtown

Wear my protection
By ways no one can judge
The lack of conviction
Change the ways of the number one

And I'll try
I'll try
I'll try

Worldwide intervention on the "do not touch"
It's too much
But I'll try
Try
I'll try

Cross my heart
Cross my heart
I'll...
