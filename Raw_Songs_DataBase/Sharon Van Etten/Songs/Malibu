We held hands as we passed the truck
Just a couple of dudes who don't give a fuck
Tab the brakes and we slow down
Just a couple of jokers on the edge of town
In Malibu
In the little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number, driving down the one

I walked in the door
The Black Crowes playing as he cleaned the floor
I thought I couldn't love him any more
In that little red number, driving down the one

Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the one
In a little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the one
In a little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the one
