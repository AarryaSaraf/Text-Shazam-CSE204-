Been down on myself
Said won't go back
Been there
My mother might say you were right

Doesn't matter where she is, not far
I'll be here for a little while
Then not gone
Long
Don't know what it is so far
I'll be here
Not only when you feel long lost

Sitting there, wet mess
We held till the sun came up
Are you aware, last steps realize?

Doesn't matter where she is, not far
I'll be here for a little while
Then not gone
Long
Don't know what it is so far
I'll be here
Not only when you feel long lost

Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away

Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
