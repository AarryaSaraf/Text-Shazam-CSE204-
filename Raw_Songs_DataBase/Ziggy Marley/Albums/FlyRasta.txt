// I Don't Wanna Live On Mars //

Don't wanna live on mars
I don't wanna drive space cars
I just wanna be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you

You give me everything I need
You're my garden, You're my breeze
Let me get down, and thank you please
Hey let me lay here for a while,
Cause you're beauty makes me high
If you cry then I will cry
Yeah, let me make one thing clear
Nothing can compare
You're love is the blue sky
You're love is a butterfly

I don't want to live on mars
I don't want to drive space cars
I just want to be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you

Oh good karma you're my queen,
Precious things my eyes have seen
Sweetest place I've ever been
You make me feel just like a king,
I'll never leave you for that girl
Oh my darling you're my world
That witch called winter is so mean,
Summers that I've never seen,
They say I'm love crazy, love crazy

Can't take the heat turn down the fire
Can't swim don't tempt the waters
Believe what you want, this is my point of view
I wanna be cool, so let me get through to you

I don't want to live on mars
I don't want to drive space cars
I just want to be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you

I don't want to live on mars
I don't want to drive space cars
I just want to be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you

// Fly Rasta //

[Chorus:]
Fly rasta, you fly rasta
Fly rasta, you fly rasta
Chedda don che
Not to have to hold up yo head, do
Redder than red
We work fo' that red

[Verse:]
Take that velvet separation onto the love
You know strom them see the dead
And all the days of yo vow-up separation
No rays of shroud will come upon yo head

[Chorus:]
Fly rasta, you fly rasta
Fly rasta, you fly rasta
Root to them roots
My spirit speak the truth
Cutter than cute
I might cheat god, boya

[Verse:]
Now there's an evil that we see under the sun
Bitches comein' around men
What have the fool moon and the wise
Band can't live alone unbread
Wear it, I would say
Enlighten the laws of jaja
With the most ganja
The fellows meditate,
Living better than lifting house over the Sanomany
Like the tree granted by water
Poverty don't spit the man don folley
These leaves never wither

[Chorus:]
Fly rasta, you fly rasta
Fly rasta, you fly rasta
Chedda don che
Not to have to hold up yo head, do
Redder than red
We work fo' that red

[Interlude:]
When I say blessin' to the money come walking out dotti
And standing in the way of civil life, I would say
Take a vow of separation
And all the days of your life
Let no rays come down upon your self

// Lighthouse //

Hey sister, the emotions have gone cold
And a part of me is missing,
Where the rivers used to flow
Hey mother, I know you must be sad
To see the things are happening
I'll fix it if I can

I'm holding up the fire
Lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
I'm holding up the fire (Holding up the fire)
Lighting up the sky (Lighting up the sky)
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright

Hey brother, some things never change
Caesar's always Caesar, and night comes into day
Hey father, they sold you like a slave
To a world that takes everything,
And gives nothing away

I'm holding up the fire
Lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
I'm holding up the fire (Holding up the fire)
Lighting up the sky (Lighting up the sky)
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright

Yeah, I'm holding up the fire
Lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
I'm holding up the fire (Holding up the fire)
Lighting up the sky (Lighting up the sky)
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
I'll bring you home alright

Holding up the fire,
I'm lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
I bring your home alright
Holding up the fire,
I'm lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
I bring your home alright

I'm holding up the fire,
Oh one love

// Sunshine //

Sunshine, Oh sunshine

Life can have it's cloudy days,
It doesn't mean you've lost your way
And on this ride we've got to hold on
Heaven do whatever you can

Sunshine, I see you shining again
Shine for me
Sunshine, I see you smiling again
Smile for me
Sunshine, I'll fight until
You shine for me
Sunshine, Oh sunshine

Sometimes I walk sometimes I fly
Finding a way to the other side
Who doesn't pay for their mistakes
Jah love can never be replaced

Yeah, Sunshine I see you shining again
Shine for me
Sunshine, I see you smiling again
Smile for me
Sunshine, I'm a crying sin
Come-a shine for me
Sunshine, Oh sunshine

Through your eyes I'll appear
Still hopeful as you left me here
Open the doors of your heart
Return the love that was lost
The night is almost over
The day is almost here
Let the light of your face
Replace the darkness of my tears

Sunshine, Oh sunshine
I'm still surviving,
Working tables turns and winds change
Oh Sunshine
Sunshine, I know you're out there somewhere
Cause Miss Misty Morning just can't stay
Oh sunshine

Sunshine, I see you shining again
Shine for me
Sunshine, I see you smiling again
Smile for me

// Moving Forward //

The human experiment comes with pain
And through it all you got to live again
From the day that I was born
Yesterday was already gone
It's not easy so I can't pretend
Those who are angels were once my friends
I don't wanna stay with the evil I know
I don't wanna keep my enemies close

I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer

I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The hurt make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer

Sometimes it seems impossible
The obstacles that we must climb
Adversity is my ally
Even though she makes me cry

Moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer

I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The hurt make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer

The hurt makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer

I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
The hurt makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer

I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
The hurt makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer

// You //

When my heart was lonely, into pieces
I went looking with the sunshine, on the beaches
All my riches, couldn't save I if I needed
Love was so close to I, Yes I was mystified
There was so much more, I need to know
Whoa, oh
Like a lost memory

I found you
I found you
I found you
And I found you
And I found you, yeah

The waves crashed into me,
Like a ship at sea
I was caught in a hurricane,
Faced with my own regrets, I took a breath
While waiting for angels who've lost their way

I found you
I found you
I found you
I found you
There I found you

Takes the salt from my face
Put some honey in my tea, yes
Cause it's the love I didn't see
That loves the most

I found you
I found you
I found you
And I found you
I found you

I found you
I found you
Yeah, I found you
And I found you
And I found you

Planted the seeds, now it grows
Open the windows to my soul
Now the other half can be told
Like a lost history
You, You, You

And I found you, yeah

// So Many Rising //

Some will not remember,
Most will never know
What life was like before the new world
Grass was clean
The air was pure
Spies weren't standing inside your doors
Teardrops fall on my shoes

Is there no time to be amused
Poor are crying to be heard
I'm crying for the world

Society my friend,
So many choices
So many devices
So many voices
Many are confused
Many are refused
So many abuse
So many rising
So many rising
So many rising

Ignorant behavior
Your strength becomes your weakness
Who will be above the fray
When the fray is getting higher everyday

Society my friend,
So many choices
So many devices
So many vices
Many are confused
Many are refused
So many abuse
So many rising
So many rising
So many rising

The Shepherds are wolves protecting their goods
And money is mightier than the pen
Greed will always take whatever it can
Maybe it must break before it bends

Some will not remember,
Most will never know
What life was like before the new world
Grass was clean
The air was pure
Spies weren't standing inside your doors
Teardrops fall on my shoes
Is there no time to be amused
Poor are crying to be heard
I'm crying for the world

Society my friend,
So many choices
So many devices
So many voices
Many are confused
Many are refused
So many abused
So many rising
So many rising
So many rising

// I Get Up //

// You're My Yoko //

You're my Yoko,
You're my Yoko Ono
You're my beauty queen
You're my fashion scene

Baby be my muse
I'm the one to choose
Take me on that ride
Wave the milky way goodbye
You give me good vibration
Oh you're sweet inspiration

Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono

You're my love machine
End the wars and find the peace
Making love wrapped in the sheets
While those preachers they preach
The art of life we lead
So the freedom that we feel
Together we will stay
When will the world see things our way

Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono

The Boys will be sad
Remembering the good times that we had
The girls will be mad
(Ziggy we don't have what we used to have)
When it's time to groove
Can't be waiting on tomorrow, Oh no
So let the music play
(Hey we'll find ourselves in the melody)

Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono

Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono

// Give It Away //

You can hide it deep inside
And don't speak a word of it
You can play the fool
And say you've never heard of it
Oh no

Hold on tight,
You can try,
Though you'll wind up losing every time
Ay!

Only if we give it away,
Can love be love
Only if we give it away
Can love be love
Yeah

Had it locked up in a box
So it'd never get away from you
Oh no
And you held on so tight
Cause of what you were afraid to do
Oh yeah

Count your coins
Pour your wine
Don't you end up lonely time after time

Only if we give it away,
Can love be love
Only if we give it away
Can love be love
Yeah

Now give it away
Give it away
Now give it away
Ay Ay
Now give it away
Alright

There's not a man alive
Who can stand up and walk away from it
In fact I even knew some men
Who think that they can pay for it
That's not real,
It's a lie
So they end up crying time after time
Oh!

Only if we give it away
Can love be love
Only if we give it away
Can love be love
Only if we give it away
Can love be love
Only if we give it away
Can love be love

Now give it away
Give it away
Now give it away
Give it away
Now Give it away
Give it away
Now give it away
Give it away
Now give it away
Give it away
Now Give it away
Give it away

I'm gonna give it away
I'm gonna give it away

Only if we give it away
Can love be love,
Now give it away
