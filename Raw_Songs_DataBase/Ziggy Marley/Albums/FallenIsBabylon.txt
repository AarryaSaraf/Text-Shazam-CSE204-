Album: FallenIsBabylon

// Fallen Is Babylon //

Fallen is Babylon all nation have drunk of her passion
Fallen is Babylon right now
Come out of her oh people unless you want to share her plagues
Listen to me now come out of her Jah Jah people in your minds
Unless you wanna partake of her sins look what you doing man
Fallen is Babylon all nation have drunk of her passion
Fallen is Babylon right now

Welcome Jah in your new name we're singing we glorify not in vain
Tell you what mysteries dead and reality claims
I mean built over many years gone in day take it now
Fallen is Babylon all nation have drunk of her passion Babylon is falling down

Fallen is Babylon right now so much heart broken so much sufferation
After this I saw another angel trod down from Zion
With great authority given to him
The Earth was lit up with his glory at the top of his voice he shouted
Babylon has fallen Babylon the great has fallen

Whore of this whole world so much sorrow she gave to many many many like you and me
Oh, so tempting just like a beautiful thing

But I just can't let myself be let myself be a next victim no no no no no
Fallen is Babylon all nation have drunk her passion
Fallen is Babylon right now right now
Babylon system is a system that exists for centuries centuries
Still run by the same mentality that runs it still here to do the same thing they've done
Conquer the poor and oppress the under privileged we got to stop that Babylon oh Babylon

// Everyone Wants To Be //

Everyone wants to be the cowboy living life the wild wild west style
Everyone wants to be the outlaw
Well everyone tough and no one is gonna back down
Everyone's tough and no one is gonna back down
Everyone wants to be the superstar live like a star and driving the fancy car
Everyone wants to get some fame playing the man's game
Everyone tough and no one is gonna back down
Capone said him tough and no one is gonna back down

Hey yo warning to informers and traitors first one die will be the instigator
Who died and left you commentator outer body experience see it's not all good
Look into the eyes of who was once Clint Eastwood
Fire koombaya for back up call Libya soldiers hold your fire I see Ethiopia
I hear you boast about who you toast around the coast
But once you hear the fire you vanish like human ghost sucker

Everyone wants to be the cowboy living life the wild wild west style
Everyone wants to be the outlaw
Well everyone's tough and no one is gonna back down
Everyone's tough and no one is gonna back down
Sandokas said him tough and no one is gonna back down
Jesse James said him rough and no one is gonna back down

// People Get Ready //

People get ready there's a train a comin'
Don't need no baggage you jus climb on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesel hummin'
Don't need no ticket you jus thank the Lord

So people get ready, for a train to Jordan
It's picking up passengers coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board her
There's hope for all among His lovin' arms

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Many are those whose chances grow slimmer
For there is no hiding place against His kingdoms throne

So people get ready there's a train comin'
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

Now whether you come from yard or whether you come from London
Wanna hear this one on your radio station
Conscious lyrics have to reach number one
Teach we come to teach we come to teach the nation lyrically lyrically inspiration
Love and nuff unity with lots of education
We'll take it by the hundred take it one by one
This is ragga with the inspiration
I can only sing of destruction today cause my people are shedding blood everywhere
There is no happy song to sing when every time I'm frowning
I watch my back as I pass through 'cause they're aiming their bullets at me
Jah say he see us through so I knew that the wicked would perish
Never forget your dreams life is full of ups and downs yeah
No matter how hard it seems never forget your dreams

Just take it day by day by day by day by day by day day by day by day by day by day

We laugh at them for they know their day is coming
The wicked draw their sword to slay the upright
The wicked bend their bows to cast down the poor
Yet their swords shall pierce them in their own hearts
Never you lose your faith things and times will have to change yeah
Say you might be down today but never you lose your faith

Just take it day by day by day by day by day by day day by day by day by day by day

This is ragga ragga telling you 'bout the boom
Worry not of tomorrow for we know not what a day may bring
Faithful are the wounds of a brother than the kisses from an enemy
Pride is their chain of honor violence is the garment that covers them
My feet were at that stumbling point but I didn't slip
Never forget your dreams life is full of ups and downs yeah
Say no matter how hard it seems never forget your dreams

Let's take it day by day by day by day by day by day day by day by day by day by day
