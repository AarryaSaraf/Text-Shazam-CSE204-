// Black My Story (Not History) //

Black my story, black my story
Not his-tory, black my story
Black my story, black my story
Not his-tory, black my story

From education to civilization
From astrology straight to biology

Black my story, black my story
Not his-tory, black my story
African glory, African glory
What we want to see, is African liberty

From Marakeshi to Egypt, Rio-De-Oro
From Cape Town to Addis-Ababa and Congo

African glory, African glory
What we want to see
African liberty, give it to me

Oh, black my story, black my story
No not his-tory, black my story
African glory, African glory
What we got to see, must be Africa's liberty

From Mozambique to Libya
Oh land of the Uganda
From Senegal to Somalia
Oh the land of good Ghana

African glory, African glory
What we want to see is African liberty
Black my story, black my story
Black my story, not his-tory

A black my story, I and story
Black my story, not his-tory
Black I story, black my story
Not his-tory, an African glory, chuc'aw African glory

// One Bright Day //

One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together

There will be celebrations around the nations
Love without no care
There will be singing, plenty swinging
Live without that fear

One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together
Yes it was one bright day
Yes it is one bright day

There is music, you choose it, love it, love it
Hear this music, don't lose it, love it, love it

One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together
Hey, unnuh see the one bright day, South Africa free
Believe me, one bright day, a drugs free country

There was sunshine on the phone line
Wondering what you were doing
And then joy sent a note and this is what she wrote

One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together
Hey, unnuh see the one bright day, South Africa free
Believe me, one bright day, a drugs free country

Make it to the one bright day
A said the struggle to the one bright day
Struggle to the one bright day
Struggle to the one bright day

Make it to the two bright days
Make it to thre...ooh
Lord, the people got together
The people got together

So there can be, many, many, years and years and years

// Who Will Be There //

So I pop the question
Who will be there
Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there
Who will be there

We need each other more than we ever did or will
We got to get together
We got to do what Jah Jah will
Or get burnt within the fire, that's not my desire

Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there
Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there

So pack your bags, let's be on our way
We got to move out within the morrows
The cripple and the blind, you best not waste no time
We got to move out within the morrow
A question giving them horror

Who will be there
Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there
Who will be there
Could you tell me

Will you be there to see Jah shining face
And to drink life giving waters
Will you be there to see the morning sun
And to live a sweet life forever
A question needs an answer

Who will be there
Who will be there
Come on, come on, come on, come on and
Who will be there
Who will be there

Who will be there
This is the start of something new
Who will be there
So come on and tell me hey, will you
Who will be there
I said is a start of something brand new
Who will be there
Baby I wanna know who

Wanna know who
Tell me now will you
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Who will be there
Who will be there

// When The Lights Gone Out //

When the lights gone out and the food run out
All we have is just the music
When the lights gone out and the food run out
All we have is just the music

A battery tape playing in the street
My only relief 
All we have is just the music

No matter what the crisis
It keep the spirit lively
Just as you feeling blue
Well I'll be there for you

When the lights gone out and the food run out
All we have is just the music
When the lights gone out and the food run out
All we have is just the music

Pretty girls dance in the street
My only relief 
All we have is just the music

There ain't no dance
Unless you have good music
If you don't have good music
Then you don't have a chance

When the lights gone out and the food run out
All we have is just the music
When the lights gone out and the food run out
All we have is just the music

And a battery tape playing in the street
My only relief 
All we have is just the music

When there ain't no justice to be found
They kicking you around
All we have is just the music

When the light gone out and the food run out
All we own is just music

You all know there ain't no party
Unless the music Irie
There ain't no love unless you show me

When the lights gone out and the food run out
All we have is just the music
When the lights gone out and the food run out
All we have is just the music

When the lights gone out and the food run out
When there ain't no justice to be found
Is just the music
When there ain't no answer from above
When there ain't no one to love
Is just the music

When there ain't no shoe on your feet
When there ain't nothing to eat
All we have is just the music
When the lights gone out and the food run out
All we have is just the music

// All Love //

There's something going on over there
There's something going on over there
But there's something going on right here, and it's our life
I see some boogie, out of their shoes
Some just grooving, grooving to the groove
I am skanking, skanking loose
But we're all doing the same thing

It's just all love
Got to be all love
It's just all love
That's right, all love

Wake up your love in the morning
Wake up your love in the night
Shape up the love, shape up the love in the morning
Shape up that love tonight

There's something going on over there
Well there's something going on over there
But there's something happening right here
It's our life, I and, I and I life
Some smile all the time, some a pop, pop till you drop
Do a steady rock, rock steady easy
'Cause we're in the same thing

It's just all love
Got to be all love, tonight
It's all love
People give it, all love, now, what what

Shake up this place let the earth quake
Wake up this place let the earth vibrate
Shake up this place let the earth quake
Wake up this place let the earth vibrate
'Cause there's something going on

Well there's something wrong going on over there
And there's something wrong, way, way, way, way, way back there
But there's something right, right here
It's our life, I and I life

All love
I'm giving it, all love
I don't, I don't know that, all love
I'm giving it, all love

I can't hold back, all love
Tonight, it's just all love, all right
All love
Don't hold back, all love

There's something happening right here
There's something happening right here
There's something happening right here
All love, all love, all love, that's what going on, all love
