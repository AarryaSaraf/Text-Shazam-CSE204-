Album: Dragonfly

// Dragonfly //

Everybody's worried about time
But I just keep that shit off my mind
People living on twenty four hour clocks
But we're on a ride that never stops

Hey mister bee the world change but you remain the same
And I wonder how you'll survive with the environment going down the drain
Hey miss dragonfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what type of creature am i

A dog looked at me and said ziggy why can't we trust man
Puss and me get together why can't you all just understand
An old tree stood there silently listening to every word we said
As a tear fell he cried what type of creature is man

I said hey mister tree the world change but you remain the same
And I wonder how you survive with the environment going down the drain
Hey miss butterfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what kind of creature am i
You must be wondering what kind of creature am i

Everybody's worried about time
But I just keep that shit off my mind
People living on twenty four hour clocks
But we're on a ride yes we're on a ride we're on a ride that never stops

Hey mister bee the world change but you remain the same
And I hope you'll survive with the environment going down the drain
Hey miss butterfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what type of creature am i
You must be wondering what type of creature is man

// True To Myself //

Life has come a long way since yesterday I say
And its not the same old thing over again I say
Just do what you feel and don't you fool yourself I say
Cause I can't make you happy unless I am I say I say I

Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself

Day in day out I've asked many questions I say
Only to find the truth it never changes I say
If you don't deal with it it keeps killing you a little by little I say
Call me selfish if you will my life I alone can live I say I say I

Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself

I don't care if it hurts I'm tired of lies and all these games
I've reached a point in life no longer can I be this way
Don't come crying to me I too have shed my share of tears
I'm moving on yes I'm grooving on well I'm finally free I've

Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself
Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself

// I Get Out //

You want me to play the game you tried again and again
To sell myself for fame fit in the format man
To suit the image you want portrayed so the people are still enslaved
You can't define what we do I won't be put in a box for you

I get out, I get out, I get, I get out, I get out

I of the universe won't be prisoners of your little world
The mind is limitless where time does not exist
We travel far beyond the realms of expectations
And I refuse to be what you expect of me

I get out, I get out, I get, I get out, I get out

What would you lose to gain the price is high to pay
Desire not to be like them to follow the dream of sin
Blessed are the meek and humble my own spirit
Cause music is a holy thing hey we giving thanks for the blessings

I get out, I get out, I get, I get out, I get out
Mama I get out papa I get out
Said I'm gonna hit it down, said I'm gonna kick it down
I get out, I get out, I get, I get out, I get out

// Looking //

My frustration won't subside I've been tried time after time
But it's not my style to quit there is more to life than this
In obscurity or fame we're all playing in this game
Searching for something searching for something

Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine

Saturday in the morning and the rain kept falling
Brother didn't get no sleep now he's really feeling beat
But there is no time to waste as the devil test his faith
He just walks away on a mission to complete

Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Looking oh find you will be fine

She has her hand on her jaw as she wonders away
What will tomorrow bring will her dreams just disappear
She find words are hard to say so she prays everyday
She must find a way may the pieces fall into place

Frustration won't subside I've been tried time after time
But it's not my style to quit there is more to life than this
In obscurity or fame we're all playing in this game
Searching for something searching for something

Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Searching for something, looking for something

// Shalom Salaam //

Lost am I in my memories of my forefathers' legacy
I am one of you you are one of me
Why don't we set the people free
How I grieve to see fulfillment of prophecy
Naive of me to think things could change
While man remain the same so war will be for me everyday
No peace no peace for the children of Israel
Gaza cries all the tears from her eyes
Will there be no peace for the children of Palestine

Shalom salaam shalom salaam

Who will take the blame for the blood of my children
To who does vengeance belong to no one no one
We're dying from tanks and suicide bombs
The only answer is to live as one
And justice will come for my sons and just will come for my sons

Shalom salaam shalom salaam

And I wonder why and I wonder who and I wonder what
Is in the heart of you
And I wonder why and I wonder who and I wonder what
Is in the heart of you
Children are children no matter color or faith
And I wonder if history will teach us again

So war will be for me everyday
No peace no peace for the children of Israel
Gaza cries all the tears from her eyes
Will there be no peace for the children of Palestine

And justice will come for my sons

Shalom salaam shalom salaam

// In The Name Of God //

In the name of god you kill in the name of your god
In the name of god you conquered in the name of your god

All religion should be wiped out
So that people may just live
What divides us is an illusion
Made up by men in their confusion

In the name of god you kill in the name of your god
In the name of god you conquered in the name of your god
In the name of god you hate in the name of your god
In the name of god you boast in the name of your god

Spoke of love no one would listen
Seems everyoneOs trying to prove something
Starting over may be the best thing
So stop the bombs and letOs begin

Cause this war no one can win and it seems IOll never learn
Oh this war no one can win well it seems IOll never learn

In the name of god you kill in the name of your god
In the name of god in the name of your god you conquered
In the name of god in the name of your god

All religion should be wiped out
Save the people stand and live
What divides us is an illusion
Made up by men in their confusion

In the name of god you kill in the name of your god
In the name of god you conquered in the name of your god
In the name of god you boast in the name of your god
In the name of god you hate in the name of your god

In the name of your god, why do you kill?, why do you hate?, in the name of god, in the name of god

// Rainbow In The Sky //

There's a rainbow in the sky all the time don't be blind
There's a rainbow in the sky all the time don't be blind don't be blind

Said you I'm living in my fantasy
But is you who are blinded from reality
The material world mean so much to you
You just can't get what I'm telling you

There's a rainbow in the sky all the time don't be blind don't be blind

Cause in a town called sorrow there was joy
Yes and there I met the painless tear
Freed he expressed emotions that egos fear
My life is full of colors yeah my mind is clear

There's a rainbow in the sky rainbow in the sky

Found I mercy in every sunrise
I am born again from the womb of the night
All I have I have left behind
Minds' eye eyes eye a light will shine

There's a rainbow in the sky all the time don't be blind don't be blind
Rainbow in the sky rainbow in the sky

// Melancholy Mood //

A little collie weed to ease I grief
Too much agony living in the limits of big city
A little collie weed to meditate
Too much insanity in this society

Melancholy mood I eat for my food melancholy mood

Rise this morning smile with the sun
Oh I'm blessed another day has begun
Everything in life has its purpose
Find its reason it has its season

Melancholy mood I eat for my food melancholy mood

Tears leave my eyes I just want to fly
Deep down I feel pain
But I know I must rise again

From this melancholy mood melancholy mood
Melancholy mood I eat for my food melancholy mood

// Good Old Days //

Irie days come on play
Let the angels fly let the devils die
Got to do what you can with the time at hand
Ali boom mah yeah Ali boom mah yeah
Don't worry your mind its just the test of time
In five years these be the good old days

No one knows what the future holds for everything has a season
Its not a time for war its a time for peace
Tomorrow knows tomorrow woes
I remember when grandpa use to say grandson these be the good old days

These be the good old days

Now comes the moon with its starry lights
And so begins the night life
The tribal dance puts me in a trance
As she pulls me in with her magic swing
I asked of her what do we celebrate
She said to me these be the good old days

These be the good old days

Leh leh leh leh leh leh leh leh

There is no future there is only now
Let's cherish these moments that we now know

These be the good old days

// Never Deny You //

All the love that we share could never just disappear
And all that we've been through I believe in you

I will never deny you

Friends said to me one day I should forget you
But my experience say what we have is true

I will never deny you

Hey Judas they will betray you
Thomases they will doubt you
Peters they will deny you
But I will never deny you

I

All the love that we share could never just disappear
And all that we've been through I believe in you

I will never deny you
Will never deny you will never deny you oh I

// Don't You Kill Love //

Don't you kill love don't you kill love don't you kill love

In the blink of an eye time passes us by
Where does it go
Now will you take a stand for love I am
Forever more
These wars have wounded my heart so my trust breaks apart
To human I say these words

Don't you kill love don't you kill love don't you kill love

This chance we should not miss to share this sacred bliss
And spread it all around I'm gonna spread it all around
My heart been broke before but still I must endure
Keep the spirits high keep the spirits high
Cause it's the greatest things in life calls for the most sacrifice
Are we brave are we brave enough

Don't you kill love don't you kill love don't you kill love
