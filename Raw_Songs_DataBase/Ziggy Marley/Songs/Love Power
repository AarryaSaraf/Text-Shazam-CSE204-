Love power, a little love power
It's stronger than de hurricane
And softer than de summer rain
Oh, love power (what kind of power) a little love power
(It can lift you up) it lift you up when you get low
And make your life bright as de rainbow
There ain't no sun in de mornin' sky
Woh oh oh oh oh
De breeze ain't blowin' and de bird don't fly
Wo oh oh oh oh
Then someone kind reaches out a hand
And smile de warm sweet smile
And then your heart come to understand
What make de world spin
Where de magic begin
And what to believe in
It feel so good when everybody feel
Oh, love power (there's no higher power) a little love power
(Nothing in de world) it stronger than de hurricane
And softer than de summer rain
Oh, love power (everybody feel it) a little love power
(Oh, oh, oh) it lift you up when you get low
And make your life bright as de rainbow
So many people they feel so bad
Woh oh oh oh oh
They make de money but they still so sad
Woh oh oh oh oh
Nobody told 'em that it ain't that stuff
That make de life worth while
Cause even if you got enough
You got less than nothin'
Till you know for certain
What to put your faith in
It feel so good when everybody feel
Oh, love power (people can you feel it) a little love power
It lift you up when you get low
And make your life bright as de rainbow
Let me tell you now, woh oh
(Feel do inspiration) yay yay
(Don't it feel like heaven)
It make de soul and de spirit strong
When everybody come and every single one
They hear the song now
Oh, love power, a little love power
It stronger than de hurricane
And softer than de summer rain
(Can you feel it) oh, love power
(What kind of power) a little love power
It lift you up when you get low
And make your life bright as de rainbow
It lift you up when you get low
An make your life bright as de rainbow
