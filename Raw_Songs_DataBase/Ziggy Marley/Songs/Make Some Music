Love is a melody playing through eternity, making sweet songs all night long
stay in the groove, we can't refuse when the rhythm is tight we'll be up all night
the perfect tune we make for life beats that vibrate moods that excite
instruments tuned, harmonies right
love is the song we make tonight

Come on baby lets make some music, this is the groove and that's how I do it
come on baby lets make some music, cause you know how, how to do it

Thinking of lyrics I could sing, but I know they must come from within
can't rush music got to take it slow keep in the groove till it starts to flow
hit the right tempo then you know, this song is not for the show



It's a beautiful thing the way you hit the way we swing
the way we rock this groove
now we're going to the roots, now we're going to the roots
hey It's a beautiful thing the way we hit the way we swing
the way we rock this groove
now we're going to the roots, now we're going to the roots
