Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone, yea

Well, I've seen a crime to which I can't be blind
Living in a diamond city with a broken heart
Well, I've seen a crime to it I can't be blind
Living in a diamond city with a broken heart
Oh diamond city, let me take you there, well well well

There everyday there's a need for revolution
She's like a mother who denies her newborn milk
Lost are the thrills of life as we know them
They one man swim yet many more are drowning

Well, I've seen a crime to which I can't be blind
Living in a diamond city with a broken heart
Yes, I've seen a crime to which I can't be blind
Living in a diamond city with a broken heart
In a diamond city let me take you there, well well well

Surely we can help each other in this earth
Ain't no need to be greedy or too proud, no need
Because the color of our skin
They gave us no chance to win

Well, I've seen a crime to it I can't be blind
Living in a diamond city with a broken heart
Well, I've seen a crime to it I can't be blind
Living in a diamond city with a broken heart
Oh diamond city, with a broken heart

We will fight for our rights
We will fight for africa
We will fight for our freedom
Did you hear?
We will fight for africa

I've seen a crime to which I can't be blind
Living in a diamond city with a broken heart
Yes, I've seen a crime where are the cops this time
Living in a diamond city with a broken heart
Oh diamond city, with a broken heart
Oh diamond city, come here, let me take you there
Let me take you there, I'll take you there
