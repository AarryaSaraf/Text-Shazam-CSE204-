We love reggae music
All you got

All you got
Peace not war
All you got
Let's make some joy, right now

Well easy, well hard
Can't sit and reason with hypocrites
Just teasing, that's all
Can't sit and eat with hypocrites

We love reggae music
All you got
We love happiness
All you got
Peace not war
Let's make, I wanna make some joy

What burden, what tasks
Can't be dealt with diplomats?
Which pardon should we ask
Can't be given by aristocrats

We love reggae music
All you got
We love happiness
All you got
Peace not war
Let's make some joy
In a dub wise

Dem dub wise
Dem dub dance
Can't be done by stiff necks
Now let's dance
And you take a chance
But you can't complete with roots man

We love reggae music
All you got, all you got
Happiness, treat me
Peace not war, no war
Let's make, we wanna make some joy
Let's do it

Well, well well well well well easy, well hard
Can't sit and reason with hypocrites
They are just teasing brother that's all
Can't sit and eat with hypocrites

We love reggae music, all you got
We love happiness, yes I will do my best
Peace not war, no no war
Let's just make some joy, choose it

Heavy music, heavy music, heavy music
Music of the bird, music of the sea
The music which is to be, reggae music
R & B, a soul, rock and roll
This a music, a reggae music, a reggae music
All music, universal language, music, music music
