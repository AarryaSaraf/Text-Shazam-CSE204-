Hop bop but don't call the cop
My sound still in the musical top, relax

Come on in, the gate is wide and open
Don't be afraid, we're not as bad as they say
Do you, do you, do what you got to do
Do you, do you, do what you got to do
Do you, do you, do what you got to do
Do you, do you

We're having fun down in the ghetto
We're having fun down in the ghetto
We're having fun down in the ghetto
We're having fun down in the ghetto

When will the innocent stop being
Punished for their innocence
When will the innocent stop being
Punished for their innocence
When will the innocent stop being
Punished for their innocence
When will the innocent stop being
Punished for their innocence

Come on in, the gate is wide and open
Don't be afraid, we're not as bad as they say
Do you, do you, do what you got to do
Do you, do you, do what you got to do
Do you, do you, do what you got to do
Do you, do you

Now I'm at a corner, gonna check a sistren
Left alone to suffer
No I'm at the station, going to check a brethren
Charge with instigating revolution

See it ya, now me sey we willy winkle
Where have you been
So skinning up your teeth, you know wi not smiling
Because you upstairs downstairs committing sin
Political wise and you don't deserve a thing
Every sufferer suffer sometimes or another

Though you see wiinna knit ganz and sweater
Wi belly could a full, but wi still a suffer
House and land down suh it without furniture
Though wi export wi coffee send wi farm worker
Ex-amount a wi people still a suffer
The ghetto gal from down suh,
Man mi sey she sweet like a wah
Man wi hail up Pam and big up Barbara
Special request to Panserella Big up the youth
Call Burro Chaga, soul man him dey yah
In nough gold chain, silver

When will the innocent stop being
Punished for their innocence
When will the innocent stop being
Punished for their innocence

You see as to how wi get this riddim yah
Fe dance wid, you dance wid ityou nuh
Sam way you nuh
