Ooh, ooh, yeah
And alright, now
And alright, now

Said I'm high on life
Thank Jah for giving me the positivity
Yes, I'm high on life
Focusing on the dream, like a laser beam
I got to be high on life
Already planted the seeds, now we water the trees
You know I'm high on life
You can't bring me down
You can't bring me down
You can't bring me down

Some people think this war is physical
Yet it's mental and spiritual
To know the truth, you got to know the lies
No, I won't be demoralized
Yes, I know the sun will rise

'Cause I'm high on life
Thank Jah for giving me the positivity
I'm gonna be high on life
Focusing on the dream, like a laser beam
Come on, get high on life
Already planted the seeds, now we water the trees
So let's get high on life
You can't bring me down
You can't bring me down
You can't bring me down

Though the world tries to drive us crazy
Keep your head up, we're survivors, baby
And in the darkness, I will be your light
So tell the cynics and their jealousy
We're bringing visions to reality

'Cause we're high on life
Thank Jah for giving me the positivity
Yes, we're high on life
Focusing on the dream, like a laser beam
Gonna be high on life
Already planted the seeds, now we water the trees
Let's get high on life
You can't bring me down
You can't bring me down
You can't bring me down

(Go Ziggy, go Ziggy, go Ziggy...)
Stress is a tool of oppression
So come let me ease up you tension
Are you ready for the good vibration?

Let's get high on life
Thank Jah for giving me the positivity
I'm gonna be high on life
Focusing on the dream, like a laser beam
You see, I'm hight on life
Already planted the seeds, now we water the trees
I got to be high on life
You can't bring me down
You can't bring me down
You can't bring me down

Let's get high on life
Thank Jah for giving me the positivity
You know I'm high on life
Focusing on the dream, like a laser beam
You gotta get high on life
Already planted the seeds, now we water the trees
Yes, I'm high of life
You can't bring me down
You can't bring me down
You can't bring me down
