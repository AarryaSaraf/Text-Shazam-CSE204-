Some will not remember,
Most will never know
What life was like before the new world
Grass was clean
The air was pure
Spies weren't standing inside your doors
Teardrops fall on my shoes

Is there no time to be amused
Poor are crying to be heard
I'm crying for the world

Society my friend,
So many choices
So many devices
So many voices
Many are confused
Many are refused
So many abuse
So many rising
So many rising
So many rising

Ignorant behavior
Your strength becomes your weakness
Who will be above the fray
When the fray is getting higher everyday

Society my friend,
So many choices
So many devices
So many vices
Many are confused
Many are refused
So many abuse
So many rising
So many rising
So many rising

The Shepherds are wolves protecting their goods
And money is mightier than the pen
Greed will always take whatever it can
Maybe it must break before it bends

Some will not remember,
Most will never know
What life was like before the new world
Grass was clean
The air was pure
Spies weren't standing inside your doors
Teardrops fall on my shoes
Is there no time to be amused
Poor are crying to be heard
I'm crying for the world

Society my friend,
So many choices
So many devices
So many voices
Many are confused
Many are refused
So many abused
So many rising
So many rising
So many rising
