We're all branches of the same family tree
But every family's different, don't you know?
Reaching for the sun comes very naturally
We've only got to let each other grow

I've got a home
I've found my place
I live with people
Who are glad to see my face

We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family

We're all working in the same big marching band
But drums and horns have different things to say
All together we'll ring music through the land
We've only got to let each other play

I've got a place
I've found my home
I'm only solo
When I want to be alone

We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family

So many groups in the family soup
So many combinations
Might be people who look like you
Or they might be no relation

Birds of a feather, they flock together
Yes, sometimes they do
But if a little bird joins an elephant herd
Hey, that's a family, too

We're all cooking up the same big barbeque
But we like spicy, you like sticky sweet
Maybe we can trade our recipe with you
Then how about we help each other eat

This is my home
These are my folks
These are our secrets
And our habits and our jokes

We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family

We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family
