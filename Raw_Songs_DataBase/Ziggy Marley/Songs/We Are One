There is a knowledge we all know
Yet we don't know, yet we don't know
There is a knowledge we all know
Yet we don't know, yet we don't know

We are one

There is a spirit we all know
Yet we don't know, yet we don't know
There is a spirit we all know
Yet we don't know, yet we don't know

We are one

Is it so hard to love one another
My brother
To see each other as we are
My sister
The earthy family
Forever

Wake up
Wake up now
Wake up
Wake up now 
Wake up to the realization
That we are all of one nation
Everyone let's have some fun
Under the moon, the stars, the sun

Cause we are one
We are one

There is a knowledge
We are one
There is a spirit
We are one
