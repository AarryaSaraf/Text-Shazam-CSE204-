One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together

There will be celebrations around the nations
Love without no care
There will be singing, plenty swinging
Live without that fear

One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together
Yes it was one bright day
Yes it is one bright day

There is music, you choose it, love it, love it
Hear this music, don't lose it, love it, love it

One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together
Hey, unnuh see the one bright day, South Africa free
Believe me, one bright day, a drugs free country

There was sunshine on the phone line
Wondering what you were doing
And then joy sent a note and this is what she wrote

One bright day the people got together
One bright day the people got together
Hey, unnuh see the one bright day, South Africa free
Believe me, one bright day, a drugs free country

Make it to the one bright day
A said the struggle to the one bright day
Struggle to the one bright day
Struggle to the one bright day

Make it to the two bright days
Make it to thre...ooh
Lord, the people got together
The people got together

So there can be, many, many, years and years and years
