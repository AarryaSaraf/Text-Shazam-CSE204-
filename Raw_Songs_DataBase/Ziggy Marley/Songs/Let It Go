Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow
Got nothing to lose
When we're dancing to the music

It's a vibration 
A sensation
A natural mystic 
All around
Coming to you from above
Coming to you from underground

Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow
Got nothing to lose
When we're dancing to the music

Let it go, you've got to let it go
Let it go, you've got to let it flow

Sometimes we just got to let go
Of everything we think we know
Sometimes we just got to be free
No one telling us how we should be

Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow
I got nothing to lose
When I'm dancing to the music

Just call me music
And don't call me nothing else
All your might
Say we dancing through the night
With all your might
Say we grooving through the night

Sometimes you just got to let go
Of everything you think we know
Sometimes we just got to be free
No one telling us how we should be

Let it go
Let your body go 

Let it go
A sensation, a natural mystic
Let your body go
Let it go now
Free your soul now
Let it go
