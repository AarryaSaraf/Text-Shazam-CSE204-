Yeah

Won't you try to be loving, Ceceil
Won't you try to be loving, Ceceil
Won't you try to be loving, Ceceil
Won't you try to be loving, come here

When will war be the answer
To what you're looking for?
I can tell ya, no
It's deja-vu once again
It's the same old thing
Stop fussing and fighting, yeah
The truth is we're hurting
Can't you see it's not working
For me or you, for me or you
It's getting hard to unwind
In these modern times
You've got to free your mind
You've got to free your mind

Won't you try to be loving, Ceceil - hey
Won't you try to be loving, Ceceil, yeah, come
Won't you try to be loving, Ceceil - do it
Now won't you try to be loving, come here

Now my friend the dove
Oh, freed from its cage
Come on and celebrate
Let's have a holiday
I treat ya good
And ya treat me right
Coming out of the darkness
Gettin' into the light
Now I leave my pride
And your loftiness
Said we take it off
Until there's nothing left
Well, I present my face
To your inner and outer space
You don't have to hide your face
It's not a human disgrace

Won't you try to be loving

And we can be together
Sometime and by the weather
Bathing on the Caribbean Sea
Yo peace and harmony
That's what you mean to me
And that's the way we should be
No, don't forget your past
But we're back at last
And now it's what we lead
So much to live for
No need to die and kill for
What I believe

Hey, won't you try to be loving, Ceceil
Yeah, come on
Come on and try to be loving, come here
