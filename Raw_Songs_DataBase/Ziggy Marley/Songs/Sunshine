Sunshine, Oh sunshine

Life can have it's cloudy days,
It doesn't mean you've lost your way
And on this ride we've got to hold on
Heaven do whatever you can

Sunshine, I see you shining again
Shine for me
Sunshine, I see you smiling again
Smile for me
Sunshine, I'll fight until
You shine for me
Sunshine, Oh sunshine

Sometimes I walk sometimes I fly
Finding a way to the other side
Who doesn't pay for their mistakes
Jah love can never be replaced

Yeah, Sunshine I see you shining again
Shine for me
Sunshine, I see you smiling again
Smile for me
Sunshine, I'm a crying sin
Come-a shine for me
Sunshine, Oh sunshine

Through your eyes I'll appear
Still hopeful as you left me here
Open the doors of your heart
Return the love that was lost
The night is almost over
The day is almost here
Let the light of your face
Replace the darkness of my tears

Sunshine, Oh sunshine
I'm still surviving,
Working tables turns and winds change
Oh Sunshine
Sunshine, I know you're out there somewhere
Cause Miss Misty Morning just can't stay
Oh sunshine

Sunshine, I see you shining again
Shine for me
Sunshine, I see you smiling again
Smile for me
