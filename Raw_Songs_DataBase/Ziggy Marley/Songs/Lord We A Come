Yeah, rastafari you know

Lord we a come, we a come, come, come...

See that children comin' from the nod?
Lord we a come, we a come, come, come
See that children comin' from the sat?
Lord we a come, we a come, come, come

So long we have been on our way
Lord, lord we, had to pay
Tyrants come for us to come
Oh oh, we woman we have just began

Once upon a time we were put up slaves
But we will not die in x again
All the youth shall  if we lead the way
And we comin' for, a brighter day

Wicked aferon?

Lord!...

So much pain we have received
Don't lead the children to disbelief

Lord!...
