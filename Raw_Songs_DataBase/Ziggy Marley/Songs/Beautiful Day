Take a look into the sky
'Cause the world is not so pretty
Free myself from worries
So I can see
It's just a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day

You could be sad
But I rather you not be
Don't dwell on the negative
Just the positivity
And it's a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day

We're always trying to satisfy these wants and needs
Take you some time for that inner peace
When your eyes are open
You'll see things differently
There's so much gloom
Hiding the reality
It's just a beautiful day
Yeah, It's just a beautiful day

Take a look into the sky
Wake up
Take a look into the sky
Keep your head up high
Take a look into the sky

I take a look into the sky
'Cause the world is not so pretty
Free myself from worries
So I can see
It's just a beautiful day

I could be sad
But you rather me not be
Don't dwell on the negative just the positivity
And it's a beautiful day
And it's a beautiful day

We're always trying to satisfy these wants and needs
Take you some time for that inner peace
When our eyes are open
We'll see things differently
There's so much gloom
Hiding the reality
It's just a beautiful day
A beautiful day

Take a look into the sky
Wake up
Take a look into the sky
Look in the sky
Keep your head up high

It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
No one can take that away
It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
Don't you feel no way
It's just a beautiful day
