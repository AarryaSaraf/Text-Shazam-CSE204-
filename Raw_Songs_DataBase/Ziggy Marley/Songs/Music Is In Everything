Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing

Tree dance as the wind blows
Clap your hands and you'll know
Music is in everything

Pots and pans they make good sound
Families now gather round
There's a concert Saturday afternoon (Saturday afternoon)
Join us in the kitchen
As we make our rhythm
Grandma, Grandpa you'll be dancing too (You'll be dancing too)
Make a rice shaker
Let's eat dinner later
Raindrops really locked into the groove (Locked into the groove)
Laughing is a nice sound
Spreading joy all around
Have you heard the river's latest tune?

Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing

The bee dance as the honey flows
Stomp your feet and you'll know
Music is in everything

Pots and pans they make good sound
Families now gather round
There's a concert Saturday afternoon (Saturday afternoon)
Join us in the kitchen
As we make our rhythm
Uncle, Auntie you'll be dancing too (You'll be dancing too)
Make a rice shaker
Let's eat dinner later
Raindrops really locked into the groove (Locked into the groove)
Laughing is a nice sound
Spreading joy all around
Have you heard the river's latest tune?

Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
