Love is the only law to obey
Don't business what they say
Love is the only law to obey
Don't business what they say

We only live to learn to love
And no lesson is greater
Make it your gain, suffer no shame

Love is the only law to obey
Don't business what they say
Love is the only law to obey
Don't business what they say

We'll only live if we learn to love
And no, no, no, no treasure is greater
What it your aim, suffer no pain

Love is the only law to obey
I know you care what they say
Love is the only law to obey
I know you care what they say

If it in your mind to commit the sin
I hope you know, no destruction is greater
What is your aim, you better explain

Love is the only law to obey
Oh yeah, don't care what they say
Love is the only law to obey
Don't care what they say

Kid you only live if you learn to love
And no lesson is greater
Make it your gain, suffer no shame

Love is the only law to obey
Love is the only law to obey
Love is the only law to obey
I don't give a... what they say

I obey, you obey, she obey, he obey
We obey, you obey, I obey, you obey
She obey, we obey, you obey, we obey
Everyone, everyone, everyone

Love is the only law to obey
The law of life, the law of life
The law of life
