DJ play that song for me
With the one drop beat
I'm not here to lean on the wall
Got to move my feet
I'm your everlaster
I'm your everlaster
Spin it faster
Spin it faster
Spin it faster
Spin it faster

Some need religion
Some just need a plan
Better use too much butter
Than to burn the pan
Reverend, priest, preacher and a pastor
Reverend, priest, preacher and a pastor
Spin it faster
Spin it faster
Spin it faster
Spin it faster

Repetition is to conviction
What a hammer is to a stone
Hard times they will come
But hard times they'll be gone

Go ahead and ask her
Go ahead and ask her
Spin it faster
Spin it faster
Spin it faster
Spin it faster
