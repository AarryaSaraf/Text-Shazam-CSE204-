Roller coaster
Got me up down
Last night under neon lights
So late, so long
In a new day with an old song
Sunrise, red eyes, it's time

Oh, it's been calling me, calling me, calling me, oh-oh
It's been pulling me, pulling me

Tired of running away
Tired of holding my breath, I see
New faces every day
But one place I cannot forget
Deep in the crowd now
But still feel alone
Tired of running away

Time to make my way back home
Make my way back
Make my way back home
Make my way back

So Jah, I know
I'll find a place someday
Don't know how I'm gonna make it there
I know I'll go
On a wing and prayer
Sunrise, red eyes, it's time

Tired of running away
Tired of holding my breath, I see
New faces every day
But one place I cannot forget
Deep in the crowd now
But still feel alone
Tired of running away

Time to make my way back home
Make my way back home
Make my way back
Make my way back

Oh, it's been calling me, calling me, calling me, oh-oh
It's been pulling me, pulling me
Oh, it's been calling me, calling me, calling me, oh-oh
It's been pulling me, pulling me

Tired of running away
Tired of holding my breath
Tired of running away

Time to make my way back home
Make my way back
Make my way back home
Make my way back
Make my way back home
(Find my way back home
Find my way back home
Oh Lord)
Got to find my way back home
