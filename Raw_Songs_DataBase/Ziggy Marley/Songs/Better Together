So much better when we're together
So much better when we're together

I don't know what happened on the way
(Oo-ooo hey, oo-ooo hey)
How did we not learn from the mistakes
(Oo-ooo hey, oo-ooo hey) Oh baby

Yes, I must stand up, will you come with me
If I fall down, you can take the lead
I know you're tired, I know you're weary
I know the ways of the world can be scary

I know it's so much better when we're together
You and I
I know it's so much better when we're together
Yeah

Now we've all been there before (oh yeah)
Even side of the wall (oh yeah)
We want to watch it fall (oh yeah)
She want to watch it, he want to watch it

Lift your hands up and put your weapons down
(Oo-ooo hey, oo-ooo hey) Put them down now
And we all know what makes the world go 'round
(Oo-ooo hey, oo-ooo hey) Around, around

Now there's a reason for every trials
And we'll need each other for survival
Yes, I'm tired, I'm a little weary
All the ways of Babylon, is so crazy

But it's so much better when we're together
Yes, it is now
And that it's so much better when we're together

'Cause we've all been there before (oh yeah)
No matter which side of the wall (oh yeah)
We wanna watch it fall (oh yeah)
He want to watch it, she want to watch it

'Cause we're so much (better when we're together)
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Yeh-eh, yeah-eh

I don't know what happened on the way
(Oo-ooo hey, oo-ooo hey) Listen time, tell me now
How did we not learn from our mistakes
(Oo-ooo hey, oo-ooo hey) Oh now, yes

Well, I must stand up and you come with me
And we don't fall down, we get up out the seats
I know we're tired, I know we're weary
I know the ways of the world can be scary

I know it's so much better when we're together
It's so much better when we're together
You and I, hey

(So much..) The sun is shining brighter today
(Better when we're together) Since you came my way
The sky's more blue, yeah

(So much..) Yesterday my glass was half empty
(Better when we're together) Today's half full
Whoa I

(So much..) And I know, I know, I know, I know
(Better when we're together) I know, I know, I know
We can't go on, not living in wrong
Yes, we can

(So much..) We're so much better
(Better when we're together)
When we get together (oh yeah)
When we get together (oh yeah)
(So much..) When we get together (oh yeah)
(Better when we're together)
Me and you together (oh yeah)
I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh, I (so much)
