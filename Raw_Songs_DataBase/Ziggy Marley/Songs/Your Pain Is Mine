Your pain is mine

When you heard, my heart cries
Oh, this emotion said it just won't lie
There's a connection, deep inside
So I let love be my guide

Your pain is mine
Your pain is mine
Your pain is mine
Your pain is mine

In joy and sorrow, we ride the tides
I can see things through your eyes
It's hard to explain, why I feel
The way I feel, I'm gonna be real
So

Your pain is mine
I tell you again
Your pain is mine
We'll be alright then
Your pain is mine
Oh, yeah
Your pain is mine

Travelling up lifes rocky road
No one should ever have to walk alone
Going through the test in times
I am here to throw a rescue line, now

'Cause your pain is mine
My love is true
Your pain is mine
What I need to do
Your pain is mine
Who can we turn to?
Your pain is mine

When you heard, my heart cries
Oh, this emotion said it just won't lie
There's a connection, deep inside
So now you let love be your guide

I won't leave you hanging, brother (your pain is mine)
When we going through the test in times (your pain is mine)
I won't leave you hanging, sister (your pain is mine)

When we going through the test in times (your pain is mine)

Your pain is mine (your pain is mine)
My love is true
Your pain is mine (your pain is mine)
Who can we turn to?
Your pain is mine (your pain is mine)
I tell you again
Your pain is mine (your pain is mine)
We'll be alright then
Your pain, your pain is mine (your pain is...)
Your pain is mine
