Oh, Human Race
If we don't make haste to find true love
Gonna be some time bums
(Time bums)
Some time bums
Oh, Human Race
If we don't make haste to find true love
Gonna be some time bums
(Time bums)
Just some time bums

Hey
Without no aim
Ain't got no shame
Drunk from the sins
Of our own hearts
Ay
Feeling pain
Yet, still in game
Show some love

Oh, Human Race
(Human race)
If we don't make haste to find true love
Gonna be some time bums
(Time bums)
Some time Bums

Oh, Human Race
(Human race)
If we don't make haste to find true love
Gonna be some time bums
(Time bums)
Just some time Bums

Well
Using the will to love
Don't take whatever they give
Aw, come on let's all get the will
And survive
Nah, hey hey hey

Who wants to dig
Upend all their souls
Who wants to live
In a false world

Oh, Human Race
If we don't make haste to find true love
We're gonna be some time bums
(Time bums)
Some time bums
(Time bums)
Oh, Human Race
We got to make haste
We got to make haste
Don't wanna be no time bum
Don't wanna be no time bums

What is the truth they give
To make us war
Which is the way they live
In their own yard
I tell you now

I stake hypocrisy
All you traitors be still
You drunkards
You got to get sober
(Sober)

Oh, Human Race
If we don't make haste to find true love
We're gonna be some time bums
(Time bums)
Just some time bums
(Time bums)
Oh, Human Race
(Human race)
We got to make haste
Got to make haste
Don't wanna be no time bums
(Time bums)
Don't wanna be..
No
(Time bums)
Groovin'

We got to make some hay
While the sun shines
We got to make some hay
While the sun shines

This is groovin'

What
This morning I woke up I felt an earthquake
We got to make some hay
While the sun shines
Tell you
This morning I woke up I felt an earthquake
We got to make some hay
While the sun shines
Now, this is groovin'
Groovin'
