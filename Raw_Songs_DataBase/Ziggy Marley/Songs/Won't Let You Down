Daddy said on his bed
I'll never forget

On your way up
Take me up
On your way down
I won't let you down

I call on you, you call on me
Where can I find my destiny?
I need to find some transportation
To the new iration

On your way up
Take me up
On your way down
Don't you let me down

On my way up
I will take you up
On my way down
I won't let you down

I sleep but my heart waketh
This is the voice that I heard, yeah
Take off my cloth but now I put it on
Love will never deny me

I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down

I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down

I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down

I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down

I call on you, you call on me
Where can I find my destiny?
I got to find some transportation
To this new iration

On your way up
Will you take me up?
On your way down
Don't you let me down

On my way up
I will take you up
On my way down
I won't let you down

I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I'll take you up now
