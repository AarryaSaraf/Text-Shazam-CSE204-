People get ready there's a train a comin'
Don't need no baggage you jus climb on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesel hummin'
Don't need no ticket you jus thank the Lord

So people get ready, for a train to Jordan
It's picking up passengers coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board her
There's hope for all among His lovin' arms

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Many are those whose chances grow slimmer
For there is no hiding place against His kingdoms throne

So people get ready there's a train comin'
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord
