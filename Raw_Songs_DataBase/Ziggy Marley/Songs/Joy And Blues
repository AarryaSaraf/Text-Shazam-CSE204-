Joy and blues...

Here we are in this ocean
Between life and death and truth and lie
Between rich and poor and sick and cure
Between joy and blues (joy and blues)

Here we are in this ocean
Between light a day and dark a night
Between nature and destruction
Between joy and blues (joy and blues)

Choose well and make sure you don't lose
Do what you gotta do
'Cause if it's money you put down
It's only money you could lose
Choose well and make sure you don't lose
Pick your choice - choose well
'Cause when your life is on the line
It's only life you can lose
Alright

We have the potion
To clear all evil notion
Putting these words in motion
I refuse to give joy to blues
Tell me why should we live between
Joy and blues

Choose well and make sure you don't lose
Do what you gotta do
'Cause if a money you put down
It's only money you can lose don't you know
Choose well and make sure you don't lose
Pick your choice - choose well
'Cause when your life is on the line
It's only life you can lose
Joy and blues
Joy and blues

Here we are in the big blue sea
Between faith and trust and hypocrisy
Between wants and needs, between joy and blues
Here we are in this ocean
Between fantasy and destiny, between quality and quantity
Between joy and blues, between joy and blues
Between joy and blues...

Choose well and make sure you don't lose
Do what you gotta do
'Cause if a money you put down
It's only money you could lose
Just choose well and make sure you don't lose
Pick your choice - choose well
When your life is on the line, your life is on the line
Your life is on the line, only life you can lose
Choose well choose well choose well make sure you don't lose
Choose well choose well choose well make sure you don't lose
