No no
No shot

They say its done
Well but it is only began
Behind everyone's back
No fools get shot

In a Kingston
In a Washington
In Chicago
Way down, way down in a Kingston

Down in South Africa
Police brutality rules
And in Ethiopia
Military power turn them fools

We got to stop
This brutality
Police brutality
Watch them
Police brutality
Stop them
Police brutality

You gave the guns
Just to shoot a brother man
But, but when it was over
You put them in a slam

You only had one thing on your mind
That was to win the elections
Now now now that you've won
I said you said you can do whatever you want

But still
Down in South Africa
Is them rule
And in Ethiopia
Them thought fools

We, we got to we got to
We got to stop
This brutality
Police brutality...

You got to stop

Stop stop stop!

Police brutality...

And they still say
Its done
But its done
Behind everyone's back

Babylon a too
Trigger trigger happy
...

Just can't take no more...

Babylon a too
Trigger trigger happy
Babylon a too
Trigger trigger happy

Shootin' the baby
Shootin' the children

Police police brutality
Trigger trigger happy

Please...
