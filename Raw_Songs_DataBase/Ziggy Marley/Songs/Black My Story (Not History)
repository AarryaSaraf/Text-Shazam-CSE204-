Black my story, black my story
Not his-tory, black my story
Black my story, black my story
Not his-tory, black my story

From education to civilization
From astrology straight to biology

Black my story, black my story
Not his-tory, black my story
African glory, African glory
What we want to see, is African liberty

From Marakeshi to Egypt, Rio-De-Oro
From Cape Town to Addis-Ababa and Congo

African glory, African glory
What we want to see
African liberty, give it to me

Oh, black my story, black my story
No not his-tory, black my story
African glory, African glory
What we got to see, must be Africa's liberty

From Mozambique to Libya
Oh land of the Uganda
From Senegal to Somalia
Oh the land of good Ghana

African glory, African glory
What we want to see is African liberty
Black my story, black my story
Black my story, not his-tory

A black my story, I and story
Black my story, not his-tory
Black I story, black my story
Not his-tory, an African glory, chuc'aw African glory
