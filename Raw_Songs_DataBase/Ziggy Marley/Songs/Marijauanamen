Hi, hi, hi, high
Marijuana man, marijuana man
Say we gonna save the land
Give the needy a helping hand
Marijuana man, marijuana man
Well, we've got to save the land
Give poor people a helping hand
The marijuana man

If politicians smokin' herbs
There would be peace around the world
Instead of wars and strife
The earth does give us seeds
To suffer is no need
Come on, feed the hungry people now

Marijuana man, marijuana man
Say we gonna save the land
And give the weak a helping hand
The marijuana man, oh marijuana man
Well, we've got to save the land
Give poor people a helping hand
The marijuana man

For diesel and gasoline
There's a solution that is clean
It's the future now, you see
Too much cow farts and meat
Put our engine in machine
Stop it where it seeps, yeah

Marijuana man, marijuana man
You know we got to save the land
Give the needy a helping hand
The marijuana man

We're gonna bring the truth to light
Still, we're in for a fight
From both left and right
Yet every little thing is gonna be alright
Oh, marijuana man (marijuana man)
Marijuana man (marijuana man)

Say we gonna save the land
Give poor people a helping hand
The marijuana man

If religious preachers smokin' herb
There would be love around the world
Instead of fear and hate
The heavens give us seeds
For spiritually needs
Come on, we can feed the hungry people, yeah

Marijuana man (marijuana man)
Marijuana man (marijuana man, marijuana man)
Well, we're gonna save the land (marijuana man)
Give the people a helping hand
Oh marijuana man (marijuana man)
Marijuana man (marijuana man, marijuana man)
Say we've got to save the land (marijuana man)
And give the needy the helping hand
Marijuana man (marijuana man)
Marijuana man (marijuana man, marijuana man)
Marijuana man, marijuana man, the marijuana man
