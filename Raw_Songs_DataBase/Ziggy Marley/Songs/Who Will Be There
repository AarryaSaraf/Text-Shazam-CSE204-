So I pop the question
Who will be there
Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there
Who will be there

We need each other more than we ever did or will
We got to get together
We got to do what Jah Jah will
Or get burnt within the fire, that's not my desire

Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there
Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there

So pack your bags, let's be on our way
We got to move out within the morrows
The cripple and the blind, you best not waste no time
We got to move out within the morrow
A question giving them horror

Who will be there
Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there
Who will be there
Could you tell me

Will you be there to see Jah shining face
And to drink life giving waters
Will you be there to see the morning sun
And to live a sweet life forever
A question needs an answer

Who will be there
Who will be there
Come on, come on, come on, come on and
Who will be there
Who will be there

Who will be there
This is the start of something new
Who will be there
So come on and tell me hey, will you
Who will be there
I said is a start of something brand new
Who will be there
Baby I wanna know who

Wanna know who
Tell me now will you
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Who will be there
Who will be there
