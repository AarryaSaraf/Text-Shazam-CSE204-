Come we sing some praises to the Almighty
I will be glad, when you say to me
Come we lick a cup up a the good sensi
I will be glad, when you say to me
Come make we go check up on we grand aunty
I will be glad, when you say to me
Come we play some ball and just a one, two, three

When the seeds of rights are trees
And the fruits we eat are sweet
Oh, I will be glad
When the seeds of justice are trees
And the fruits we eat are sweet
Hey, I will be glad, oh

Do you mind, do you mind, do you mind
Do you mind, do you mind

Do you mind, do you mind
Do you mind a heart full of love, do you mind I?
Do you mind the blessings from above, do you mind I?
Do you mind the fire keeps you warm, do you mind I?
Do you mind the universal law, do you mind I?

I will be glad, when you say to me
Come mek we go watch a really good movie
I will be glad, when you say to me
Come we go a beach just a jump inna the sea
I will be glad, when you say to me
Come we finda way and live it more naturally
I will be glad, when you say to me
Play the reggae music, mek we feel irie

When the seeds of rights are trees
And the fruits we eat are sweet
Oh, then I will be glad
When you find the truth that's real
It's one that we all can feel
Oh, I will be glad, oh

Do you mind, do you mind, do you mind
Do you mind, do you mind
Do you mind, do you mind, do you mind

Do you mind a heart full of love, do you mind I?
Do you mind the blessings from above, do you mind I?
Do you mind the fire keeps you warm, do you mind I?
Do you mind the universal law, do you mind I?
