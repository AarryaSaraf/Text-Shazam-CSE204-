When my heart was lonely, into pieces
I went looking with the sunshine, on the beaches
All my riches, couldn't save I if I needed
Love was so close to I, Yes I was mystified
There was so much more, I need to know
Whoa, oh
Like a lost memory

I found you
I found you
I found you
And I found you
And I found you, yeah

The waves crashed into me,
Like a ship at sea
I was caught in a hurricane,
Faced with my own regrets, I took a breath
While waiting for angels who've lost their way

I found you
I found you
I found you
I found you
There I found you

Takes the salt from my face
Put some honey in my tea, yes
Cause it's the love I didn't see
That loves the most

I found you
I found you
I found you
And I found you
I found you

I found you
I found you
Yeah, I found you
And I found you
And I found you

Planted the seeds, now it grows
Open the windows to my soul
Now the other half can be told
Like a lost history
You, You, You

And I found you, yeah
