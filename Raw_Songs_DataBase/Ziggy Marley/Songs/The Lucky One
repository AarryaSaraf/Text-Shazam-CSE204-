I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one

I never knew true love could be true
Till I got my eyes on you
Wondering how it feels so right
Opening up my mind tonight
A little bit'll take me a long way
I get my blessings every day
Wondering how it feels so nice
Opening up my heart tonight

I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one

Ay
Taking in the feelings I won't define
You are the light that makes me shine
Living in a world that's full of lies
Only the real one will survive
Nobody, nobody really knows
How this love started to grow
They sit and wonder all the time
How we lit in this story of mine

I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one, yeah
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one
She said it
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one



I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one, yeah
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one
She said it
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one
She said
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one
No, I'm the lucky one
No, I'm the lucky one
No, I'm the lucky one
I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
