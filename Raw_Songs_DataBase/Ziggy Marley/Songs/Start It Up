You can live like a champion
Save the world we live in
Burn down the walls of our skin
We can rise from the ashes again

When the politician take all our rights
And they shake us all down with their might
When government can shoot
Down on defenseless youth
You can see people's marches unite

It don't take a blind man to see where the world is headed
It won't take a wise man to know that our Earth is threatened
There is no future to seek if we don't come together
Love is the chance that we take and the answer forever
Yeah, sing it with me

Start it up, start it up, start it up
