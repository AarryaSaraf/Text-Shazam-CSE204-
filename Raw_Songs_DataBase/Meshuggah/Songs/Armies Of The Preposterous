The awe it instills
How grand this revolting spectacle
Beyond what we can fathom
So far detached from reason
I quiver before it, I tremble
I see your vision, this bleak truth you contrive

Magnificent this vile display
The march of a recurring echo
Jericho trumpets blaring - again they sound
And the old armies of the misled rebuild, reassemble

I will not swallow the bile
The putrid ideals you regurgitate

A conviction saturated with imbecility
Adopting the course of the blind
Unanimous in your revolting declaration
Conjured by offensive, feeble beehive minds

A pandemic, this contagion you embrace
The poison that seeps from your piteous souls
Armies of the preposterous, trapped in misguided thrall
Your mere existence shames us all

I will never assimilate your point of view
I see your vision, this bleak truth you contrive
