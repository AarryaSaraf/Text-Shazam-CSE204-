// Discoverer //

Hey baby
This is not a challenge
It just means that I don't love you as much as I always said I did

I was wrong
I have been laughable wrong
Sandpaper, paper mache, chalk, and hung out web

Of the city and your skin now..
I didn't have to be afraid
I didn't have to feel so stupid
I can see myself! I can feel

That's just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was,
Let's all get on with it, now!

Discoverer! [4x]
Laughing! [Laughing]
Discoverer!

Floating across Houston
This is where I am.
I see the city rise up tall.
The opportunities and possibilities.
Well, I have never felt so called.

Remember the vodka espresso night of discovery,
Remember that?
Laughing! Discovery!
Oh how I look back and reflect
How I felt it, how it set.
I don't have to feel so wrong
Now I wake up dreaming saffron, turmeric and brass

Just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was,
Let's all get on with it, now!

Just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was,
Let's all get on with it, now!

Discoverer! [5x]

// All The Best //

So over me
So pie in my face
So talk to me
Tell me where to place these
In my Quasimodo heart
That's where I slipped and fell
I rang the church bell
Till my ears bled red blood cells

I think I'll sing it and rhyme
I'll give it one more time
I'll show the kids how to do it fine, fine, fine, fine

I hold the mirror off
You tell me what is what
You tell me which part of my story baby stuck, stuck, stuck
I'm in a part of your dreams
That you don't even understand
It's just like me to overstay my welcome men

Let's sing it and rhyme
Let's give it one more time
Let's show the kids how to do it fine, fine, fine, fine

Oh...

I just have to get that off my chest
Now It's time to give on with the best
All the best
All the best
All the best
All the best, best, best

It's just like me to overstay my welcome bless

Let's sing it and rhyme
Let's give it one more time
Let's show the kids how to do it fine, fine, fine, fine
Let's sing it and rhyme
Let's give it one more time
Let's show the kids how to do it fine, fine, fine, fine

// Überlin //

Hey now, take your pills and
Hey now, make your breakfast
Hey now, comb your hair and off to work
Crash land, no illusions, no collision, no intrusion
My imagination runs away

I know, I know, I know what I am chasing
I know, I know, I know that this is changing me

I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
I am flying on a star, star, star
I will make it through the day
And then the day becomes the night
I will make it through the night

Hey now, take the U-Bahn, five stops, change the station
Hey now, don't forget that change will save you
Hey now, count a thousand-million people, that's astounding
Chasing through the city with their stars on bright

I know, I know, I know what I am chasing
I know, I know, I know that this is changing me

I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
I am flying on a star, star, star
I will make it through the day
And then the day becomes the night
I will make it through the night

I don't mind repeating, I am not complete
I have never been the gifted type
Hey, man, tell me something, are you off to somewhere?
Do you want to go with me tonight?

I know, I know, I know that this is changing
We walk the streets to feel the ground I'm chasing: ÜBerlin

I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
I am flying on a star, star, star
I will make it through the day
And then the day and then the day becomes the night
I will make it through the night

// Oh My Heart //

The kids have a new take
A new take on faith
Pick up the pieces
Get carried away
I came home to city half erased
I came home to face what we faced

This place needs me here to start
This place is the beat of my heart

Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)
Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)

Storm didn't kill me
The government changed
Hear the answer call
Hear the song rearranged
Hear the tress, the ghosts and the buildings sing
With the wisdom to reconcile this thing

It's sweet and it's sad and it's true
How it doesn't look bitter on you

Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)
Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)

Mother and father
I stand beside you
The good of this world
Might help see me through

This place needs me here to start
This place is the beat of my heart

Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)
Oh my heart
Oh my heart
(oh my heart)

// It Happened Today //

This is not a parable
This is a terrible
This is a terrible thing

Yes I will rhyme that after, after all I've done today
I have earned my wings

It happened today.
Hooray! Hooray!
It happened.
Hip, hip, hooray!

We'll leave the allegory to another Bible story
Out of deference, defiance and choice
And close in on a promise after, after all I've done today
I have earned my voice

It happened today.
Hooray! Hooray!
It happened.
Hip, hip, hooray!

// Every Day Is Yours To Win //

With the walk (walk)
and the talk (talk)
and the tic-tac clock (clock)

With the rock (rock)
and the roll (roll)
and the bridge (bridge)
and the told (told)

With the brilliance (brilliance)
and the light (light)
with the sting (sting)
and the hide (hide)
and the road ahead of you.

I cannot tell a lie
It's not all cherry pie
But it's all there waiting for you
Yeah you

Hey Yeah
Hey Yeah
Hey Yeah
I know

With the walk (walk)
And the woods (woods)
And the southern fudge (fudge)
There's an old look bitter and blue

While I'm nothing but confused (confused)
with nothing left to lose (lose)
and if you buy that
I've got a bridge for you

Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
I know

Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
I know

Oh...

Every day is new again
Every day is yours to win
And that's how heroes are made

I wanted (I wanted) to win (to win)
so I'd said it again:
That's how heroes are made

Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah
I know

Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah
I know

Ah...

// Mine Smell Like Honey //

I would dare you, but I know I don't need to 
You're going to do just what you want to 
You're going to take the leading chair at the fairground 
You're going to sing the praises of your fruit 

Mine smell like honey, uh! 
Mine smell like honey, uh! 
Mine smell like hu- hu- hu- honey, uh! 

Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper! 
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper! 
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper! 
Track a trail of honey through it all 

If the end comes faster than we had expected 
And predictions lead us to the final fall 
If the flowers crack the grave and leave the pattern of the pavement 
I can hear you shouting over it all 

Mine smell like honey, uh! 
Mine smell like honey, uh! 
Mine smell like hu- hu- hu- honey, uh! 

Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper! 
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper! 
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper! 
Track a trail of honey through it all 

Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper! 
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper! 
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper! 
Track a trail of honey through it all 

You track a trail of honey through it all 
You track a trail of honey

// Walk It Back //

Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
What, what would you
Have had me say?
Instead of what I said

Where, where would I go?
How could I follow that?
Except to do what I did

Which it's to
Walk it back
Walk it back
Hmmm... Walk it back

Time reversing me why
erasing me vice
and tried to start again

You, don't you turn this around
I have not touch the ground in
I don't know how long

You say to
Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Hmmm... Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back

Time, time, time it cannot revive
You, you can't turn away
You asked me to stay
but something needs to change

Why can't you
Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Hmmm... Walk it back

// Alligator Aviator Autopilot Antimatter //

I feel like an alligator
Climbing up the escalator
Climbing up the escalator
I feel strong

I feel like an aviator pilot
Thinks you wouldn't buy it
I'm feeling violent
Beat your bleeding eye in
Hey, hey, alligator, you've got a lot to learn
I have, have got a lot to learn

I feel like an autopilot
I'm the world's strongest island
I feel like a rage coming under my hood
I feel good and calm like a robot would

I feel like an autopilot
I feel like an autopilot
I am not a hater, hater, hater, hater, hater
Hey, hey, alligator, you've got a lot to learn
I have, have got a lot to learn

I feel like a contradiction
I'm a walking science-fiction
I don't know which way to turn
I've got a lot to learn
I've got a lot of lot to learn

If I didn't like the way you stared at me
If I didn't like the way you stared at me
I could sideways, I could knock you blind
I could show you found to the lost and find

I am not an agitator
I feel like an agitator
Climbing up the escalator...
Hey, hey, alligator, you've got a lot to learn
I have got, have got a lot to learn

You've got so much to learn
You got a lot to learn...

// That Someone Is You //

With the restraint of New Order covers, young marble giants
I sat quietly waiting
For someone else to make the first move
Someone has to make the first move...

That someone is you
That someone is you
That someone has pulled me up and out of cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me!

And with the fury lock of Sharon Stone Casino
Scarface, Al Pacino
'74 Torino
Waiting for someone else to make the first move
Someone has to make the first move

That someone is you
That someone is you
That someone has pulled me up and out of cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me!

Pulled me up and out of cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me!

// Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando And I //

We live and dream about the future
Please ask me out, I need to pow-wow now
So through the annals of our flavoured times
Our heroes and all their fader thoughts

Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I, sing...
Lay me down, down, down, down
Lay me down, down, down, down, down

Help me off to sleep
And take me deep again

We live and dream about our heroes
I listened closely and I said
"I'm not sure where to place myself here, friend.
Am I upon the gold rings and stand?"

The winners write the rulebooks, the histories and lullabies

Lay me down, down, down, down
Lay me down, down, down, down, down

Help me off to sleep
(down, down, down)
Take me deep again
(down, down, down)
I have watched you sing
(down, down, down)
I picture glass wings in your head
(take me down, down, down)
While golden broads and combines
(down, down, down)
Or brasses mixed with lead

// Blue //

Yellow circus left the stakes a broken ropes world's useless mug
The ties that bind, ha ha
I can be bad poet
Street poet
Shit poet
Kind poet too

Subway
Almost 4AM
Halloween night
Had enough to drink to make my own party
All my fellow writers in half costume, half asleep
Half silly, gone to seed

I don't mark my time with dates, holidays, faded wisdom, locked karma holders
Convenient

I am made by my times
I am a creation of now
Shaken with the cracks and crevices
I'm not giving up easy
I will not fold
I don't have much
But what I have is gold

I saw your face...

I sing in platinum
I dress in brass
I eat in zinc
Let it pass

Compare a toast
I like that
I understand courage
I still roll with the shout of a character I was married to today
I try to see outside myself
I understand the eyes
Excuse all the highs
Sorry
I am sorry
Ha ha

I like you, love you, every coast of you.
I've seen your eddies and tides and hurricanes and cyclones.
Low ebb tide and high, full moon.
Up close and distant.
I read you.
Look, the sky, the sea, the ocean, the sun, the moon.
Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
Naked and blue.

Breathing with you. Touch. Change. Shift. Allow air. Window open. Drift. Drift away. Into now.

I want Whitman proud. Patti Lee proud. My brothers proud. My sisters proud. I want me. I want it all. I want sensational. Irresistible.

This is my time and I am thrilled to be alive.

Living. Blessed. I understand.

Twentieth century:
Collapse Into Now

Cinderella boy
You've lost your shoe

Cinderella boy
Your coach awaits

A sun makes shadows
All over your face
As you sit
Naked and blue
Into me
