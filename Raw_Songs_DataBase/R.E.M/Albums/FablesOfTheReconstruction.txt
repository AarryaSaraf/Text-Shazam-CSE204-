// Feeling Gravitys Pull //

I fell asleep and read just about every paragraph.
Read the scene where gravity is pulling me around
Peel back the mountains peel back the sky
Stomp gravity into the floor
It's a Man Ray kind of sky
Let me show you what I can do with it
Time and distance are out of place here 
Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed
When the light is mine
I felt gravity pull

Somewhere near the end it said
You can't do this
I said, I can too
Ships sway, rivers shift
Oceans form and mountains drift
It's a Man Ray kind of sky
Let me show you what I can do with it 
Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed
When the light is mine
I felt gravity pull (into my eyes)
Holding my head straight (looking down)
This is the easiest task I've ever had to do

I fell asleep and read just about every paragraph
Read the scene where gravity is pulling me around
Ships sway and rivers shift
Oceans form and mountains drift
It's a Man Ray kind of sky
Let me show you what I can do with it
Time and distance are out of place here 
Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed
When the light is mine
I felt gravity pull (into my eyes)
Holding my head straight (looking down)
This is the easiest task I've ever had to do

Reason had harnessed the tame
Holding the sky in their arms
Gravity pulls me down

// Maps And Legends //

He's not to be reached, he's to be reached
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached

Called the fool, and the company
On his own, where he'd rather be
Where he ought to be, he sees what you
Can't see, can't you see that

Maybe he's caught in the legend
Maybe he's caught in the mood
Maybe these maps and legends
Have been misunderstood

Down the way the road's divided
Paint me the places you have seen
Those who know what I don't know
Refer to the yellow, red, and green

Maybe he's caught in the legend
maybe he's caught in the mood
Maybe these maps and legends
Have been misunderstood

He's not to be reached, he's to be reached
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached 
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached

The map that you painted didn't seem real
He just sings whatever he's seen
Point to the legend, point to the east
Point to the yellow, red, and green

Maybe he's caught in the legend
Maybe he's caught in the mood
Maybe these maps and legends
Have been misunderstood, been misunderstood

Is he to be reached, he's not to be reached
Is he to be reached, he's not to be reached
Is he to be reached, he's not to be reached any more

// Driver 8 //

The walls are built up, stone by stone; 
the fields divided one by one. 
And the train conductor says, 
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break 
we've been on this shift too long" 

And the train conductor says, 
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break 
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away" 
I saw a treehouse on the outskirts of the farm. 
The power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged. 
Bells are ringing through the town again, 
Children look up, all they hear is sky-blue, bells ringing 

And the train conductor says 
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break 
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away" 

Way to shield the hated heat. 
Way to put myself to sleep. 
Way to shield the hated heat. 
Way to put myself, my children to sleep. 

He piloted this song in a plane like that one. 
She is selling faith on the Go Tell crusade. 
Locomotive 8, Southern Crescent, hear the bells ring again. 
Field to weed is lookin' thin 

And the train conductor says 
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break 
We've been on this shift too long." 
And the train conductor says, 
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break. 
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away"

// Life And How To Live It //

Burn bright through the night, two pockets lead the way
Two doors to go between the wall was raised today
Two doors, two names to call your other and your own
Keep these books well stocked away and take your happy home

My carpenter's out and running about and talking to the street
My pockets are out and running about and barking in the street
To tell what I have hidden there

Burn bright through the night, two pockets lead the way
Two doors to go between the wall was raised today
Raise the walls to hide these flaws, the carpenter should rest
So that when you tire of one side the other serves you best

My carpenter's out and running about, talking to the street
My pockets are out and running about and barking in the street
To tell what I have hidden there

The hills ringing hear the words in time, listen to the holler
Listen to my walls within my tongue
Can't you see you made my ears go tin
The air quicken tension building inference suddenly
Life and how to live it

Raise the walls to hide these flaws, the carpenter should rest
So that when you tire of one side the other serves you best
Read about the wisdom wall, the knock-knock-knock
A secret knock, one hammer's locked, the other wisdom's lost

My carpenter's out and running about and talking to the street
My pockets are out and running about and barking in the street
To tell what I have hidden there

My carpenter's out and running about, walking the
Listen to the holler
My pockets are out and running about, barking in the street
To tell what I have hidden there

Listen, listen to the holler
If I write a book it will be called
Life and how to live it

// Old Man Kensey //

Old man Kensey wants to be a sign painter
First he's got to learn to read
He's gonna be a clown on TV
Flexes his elbow taut and free
(That's my folly) I believe
Drink up the lake, Kensey's awake
(If that's my folly) that's my mistake

Old man Kensey wants to be a goalie
First he's got to learn to count
He's gonna be a clown on a circus mount
Letters to be signed and dropped off
(That's my folly) Kensey's going far
John, Bill and Ed, stand on your head
(If that's my folly) I'm ready to go 

Old man Kensey wants to be a dog catcher
First he's got to learn to stand
He's gonna be a clown in a marching band
Letters to be signed, ransom, greed
(If that's my folly) I believe
Drink up the lake, John, Bill and Ed
(If that's my folly) that's my mistake

Kensey's awake, stand on your head
(If that's my folly) I'm ready to go
Drink up the lake, stand on your head
(If that's my folly) I'm ready to go

// Can't Get There From Here //

When the world is a monster bad to swallow you whole
Kick the clay that holds the teeth in, throw your trolls out the door
If you're needing inspiration, Philomath is where I go by dawn
Lawyer Jeff, he knows the lowdown, he's mighty bad to visit home 

(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 

When your hands are feeling empty, stick head jumpin' off the ground round
Tris is sure to shirr the deer out, Brother Ray can sing my song 

(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 

Hands down, Calechee bound, landlocked, kiss the ground
Dirt of seven continents going round and round
Go on ahead, Mr. Citywide, hypnotized, suit-and-tied
Gentlemen, testify 

If your world is a monster bad to swallow you whole
Philomath, they know the lowdown, throw your trolls out the door 

(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here

// Green Grow The Rushes //

The wheelbarrow's fallen, look at my hands
They've found some surplus cheaper hands
Rubbing palms and pick and choose
Who will they choose, here is the news

Look at that building, look at this man
Haloed and whitewashed
Gone to find a cheaper hand
He'll offer a pound, offer a pound

Green grow the rushes go, green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go, the compass points the workers home

Pay for your freedom
Or find another gate
Guilt by associate, the rushes wilted a long time ago
Guilty as you go

Stay off that highway, word is it's not so safe
The grasses that hide the greenback
The amber waves of gain again
The amber waves of grain

Green grow the rushes go, green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go, the compass points the workers home

// Kohoutek //

Who will stand alone

She carried ribbons, she wore them out 
Courage built a bridge, jealousy tore it down 
At least it's something you've left behind
And like Kohoutek you were gone
We sat in the garden, we stood on the porch
I won't deny myself, we never talked

She wore bangles, she wore bells
On her toes and she jumped
Like a fish, like a flying friend
You were gone, like Kohoutek, can't forget that
Fever built a bridge, reason tore it down
If I am one to follow who will stand alone

Maybe you're not the problem, scissors, paper, stone
If you stand and holler, these prayers will talk
She carried ribbons, she wore them out
Michael built a bridge, Michael tore it down
At least it's something you've left behind
Like Kohoutek, you were gone

Michael built a bridge, Michael tore it down 
If I stand and holler will I stand alone

// Auctioneer (Another Engine) //

She didn't want to get pinned down by her prior town
Get me to the train on time, here, take this nickel, make a dime
Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave
What is at the other end I don't know, another friend
Another wife, another morning spent

Listening, listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

We never wrote the reasons that I need explained
Some things are givens and others get away
This time it's for myself, you call it what you may
Okay, we won't say goodbye so long, so much more

And listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine
Listen to the bargain holler, listen to the barter holler
Listen to the auctioneer

Get me to the train on time, here, take this nickel, make a dime
Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave
What is at the other end of it, I don't know, another friend
Another wife, another morning spent

Listening, listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine 
Another engine, another engine
Another

Listen to the bargain holler listen to the barter holler

// Good Advices //

When you greet a stranger, look at his shoes
Keep your money in your shoes, put your trouble behind
When you greet a stranger, look at her hands
Keep your money in your hands, put your travel behind
Who are you going to call for, what do you have to say
Keep your hat on your head
Home is a long way away

At the end of the day, I'll forget your name
I'd like it here if I could leave and see you from a long way away 

When you greet a stranger, look at his shoes
Keep you memories in your shoes, put your travel behind
Who are you going to call for, what do you have to say
Keep your hat on your head
Home is a long way away

At the end of the day, when there are no friends
When there are no lovers, who are you going to call for
What do you have to change

A familiar face, a foreign place, I'll forget your name
I'd like it here if I could leave and see you from a long way away
Who are you going to call for, what do you have to say
Keep your hat on your head
Home is a long way away

// Wendell Gee //

That's when Wendell Gee
Takes a tug upon the string
That held the line of trees
Behind the house he lived in
He was reared to give respect
But somewhere down the line he chose
To whistle as the wind blows
And listen as the wind blows through the leaves

He had a dream one night
That the tree had lost its middle
So he built a trunk of chicken wire
To try and hold it up
But the wire, the wire turned to lizard skin
And when he climbed it sagged
There wasn't even time to say
Goodbye to Wendell Gee
So whistle as the wind blows
And listen as the wind blows through the leaves

There wasn't even time to say
Goodbye to Wendell Gee
So whistle as the wind blows
And listen as the wind blows through the leaves
If the wind were colors
And if the air could speak
Then whistle as the wind blows
And whistle as the wind blows through the leaves
