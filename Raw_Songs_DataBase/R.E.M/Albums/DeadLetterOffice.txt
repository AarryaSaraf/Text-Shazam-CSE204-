// Windout //

Windout, if you're out of wind
Windout, if you're really spent
Windout, if you're young and red

Yeah, tick tock, it's tine o'clock
Once is good enough, you really go...

So find out - if you're really spent
Find out - if you're out of wind
Windout - if you're out of sin

Yeah, tick tock, it's tine o'clock
Once is good enough, you really go...
Winding up

There's no doubt - that you're feeling fine
No doubt - that you're out of mind
No doubt - that you're young and red

Windout - if you're really spent
Find out - if you're young and red
Windout - if you're out of wind
If you're young and red

Tick tock time to clock my band
Once is good enough, you really go

Windout, find out, no doubt
Windout, find out, no doubt
Windout, windout, windout

// Toys In The Attic //

Light voices scream nothing seems real's a dream
Leaving the things that you learned behind
Leaving the things that you love behind
All of the things that you learned were real
Nothing except for the years
Voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream

All of the things that you learned were real
Nothing except for the years
Voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream

// Crazy //

Listen

You're funny and you don't know why
You're funny and you can't even cry
You're funny and you don't know why
You're funny and you don't even try

'Cause your head's shaking and your arms are shaking
And your feet are shaking 'cause the earth is shaking
'Cause your head's shaking and your arms are shaking
And your feet are shaking 'cause the earth is shaking

Listen
Listen
Listen
Listen, oh

You're hungry and you don't know why
You're hungry and you can't even cry
You're hungry and you don't know why
You're hungry and you don't even cry

'Cause your head's shaking and your arms are shaking
And your feet are shaking 'cause the earth is shaking
'Cause your head's shaking and your arms are shaking
And your feet are shaking 'cause the earth is shaking

You take a walk and you try to understand
Nothing can hurt you
Unless you want it to
There are no answers
Many reasons to be strong
You take a walk, you take a walk
You take a walk and you try to understand, oh

'Cause your head's shaking and your arms are shaking
And your feet are shaking 'cause the earth is shaking
'Cause your head's shaking and your arms are shaking
And your feet are shaking 'cause the earth is shaking

You're in love and you don't know why
You're in love and you can't even cry
You're in love and you don't know why
You're in love and you don't even try

// There She Goes Again //

There she goes again
She's out on the street again
She's down on her knees my friend
Won't have to ask her please again

Look a little closer there's no tears in her eyes
You know she won't make it with just any guy
What can you do
See her walking down the street
With all your friends she's gonna meet
You'd better hit her

// Burning Down //

From the back of my neck, oh oh oh
Wired a glass jaw, oh oh
Plantation burning your boat is coming in
Strum your jew's harp, you're reeking gin

Running water on a sinking boat
Going under but they've got your goat

Burning down
My hands are tied my feet are bound
Burning down
Can't you see that my hands are bound

Johnny Mike is reading in the yard
His story's timely, oh oh oh
What river is it anyway, radio
Not in a boat, in your ear

Running water in a sinking boat
Going under but they've got your goat

Burning down
My hands are tied my feet are bound
Burning down
Can't you see that my hands are bound

You pick your island in the sun
Take your island off he's got a gun

Burning down
My hands are tied my feet are bound
Burning down
Can't you see that my hands are bound

He's cooking in the woods, a brush fire in your neck
Feeling mighty mighty, oh oh oh
You can pick your island in the sun
Take your island off he's got a gun

Running water in a sinking boat
Going under but they've got your goat

Burning down
My hands are tied my feet are bound
Burning down
Can't you see that my hands are bound

// Voice Of Harold //

Reverend Bill Funderburk sings "He Cared That Much For Me".
Charles Surratt introduces his own composition "On Calvary For Me".
"The Joy of Knowing Jesus" is a song of pure delight featuring John Barbee.

The pure tenor quality of the voice of Harold Montgomery gives a special interpretation to the grand old hymn "The Old Rugged Cross".
Chill bumps appear and I am frozen in the web they weave as they reveal their innermost selves with the outpouring of their hearts...

On and on the songs roll and soon you are caught up in the sermon in each rendition as you come to feel the devotion and dedication that is poured forth.
Suddenly, you know they are real, they mean it!

"Let your light so shine..." could not be more aptly applied as there shines a light from heaven on your heart through their singing. 

As an artist, Rhonda Montgomery exemplifies piano artistry. That's Rhonda! An artist!

This album can be the instrument to mend a broken heart or to straighten out your life through the sincere testimony in the songs of THE REVELAIRES. A must!

// Burning Hell //

Women got legs, men got pants
I got the picnic, you got the ants
Put it in the fire heaven knows
Take my torch and touch your toes in hell
It's a burning hell

You can burn in Hell
It's a burning hell
You can burn in Hell
It's a burning hell

Women don't fret, boys don't bet
Let me see your silhouette in Hell
Women above me take my love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love

Oh, it's a burning hell
It's a burning hell
Baby, baby, baby, I'm hell
It's a burning hell

Girl stop moving, boy behave
Baby, I'll put you in an early grave in Hell
Love on the ceiling, love on the floor
I'm gonna leave you burning for more
Burn in the country, burn downtown
All the best people are burning down in Hell, Hell, Ah hell

It's a burning hell
You'll burn in Hell
It's a big, burning, giant, colossal matter
Hell
Oh baby, I'm hell

Burn, Burn, Burn!

// Ages Of You //

Postcard stowaway within
Pristine indigo without
Banded ottoman as such
Sofa seated one too much

All along the range, ra-da-da-da-da
All along the range, ra-da-da-da-da
Ra-da-da-da-da
Ages of you
Ages of you
Ages of you

Postcard stowaway within
Pristine indigo without
Banded ottoman as such
Sofa seated one too much

All along the range, ra-da-da-da-da
All along the range, ra-da-da-da-da
Ra-da-da-da-da
Ages of you
Ages of you
Ages of you

Train pulls over hanging bridge
Conductor looks up, thinks
Out and down, hands stuck to the left
To the right, you should fall,
The horses just don't gossip anymore

Postcard stowaway within
Pristine indigo without
Banded ottoman as such
Sofa seated one too much

All along the range, ra-da-da-da-da
All along the range, ra-da-da-da-da
Ra-da-da-da-da
Ages of you
Ages of you
Ages of you

// Pale Blue Eyes //

Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel just about everything
Lately I'm just feeling bad
Lately I'm just feeling bad

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

I thought of you as my mountain top
I thought of you as my peak
I thought of you as just about everything
I had but couldn't keep
I had but couldn't keep

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

// Bandwagon //

Come on aboard, I promise you you won't hurt the horse
We treat him well, we feed him well.
There's lots of room for you on the bandwagon
The road may be rough, the weather may forget us

But won't we all parade around and sing our songs
A magic kingdom, open-armed

Greet us hello, bravo, name in lights
Passing on the word to fellow passengers and players, passing in
Until you're tired looking at all the flags
And all the banners waving
This is some parade, yesiree Bob

Could we have known?
Yesiree Bob, could we have known?

Look at all the flags and all the banners waving
Open up our arms, a magic kingdom, open-armed and greet us all

Come on aboard I promise you, you won't hurt the horse
We treat him well, we feed him well
There's lots of room for you on the bandwagon
The road may be rough, the weather may forget us

But won't we all parade around
And sing our songs and wave our flags
A magic kingdom, greet us all hello
Greet us hello, greet us hello

// Femme Fatale //

Here she comes
You better watch your step
She's going to play you for a fool
It's true

It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She'll build you up to just put you down
What a clown

'Cause everybody knows          
The things she does to please   
She's just a little tease       
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

You're written in her book
You're number 37, have a look
She's going to play you for a fool
Yes it's true

Little boy on the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's gonna smile to make you frown
What a clown

'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
Oh

// Walters Theme //

Hey this is David
I've got a hat the size of Oklahoma
Put on my boots and going down to Walter's
Get me some barbecue
Bring some home to the misses
He'll give you a bag to put it in
This is David, signing off

// King Of The Road //

Trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No cars no pool no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

It takes four hours of pushin' broom
To buy a four-by-twelve two-bit room
I'm a man of means, by no means 
King of the road

Trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No cars no pool no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

It takes eight hours of pushin' broom
To buy a four-by-twelve two-bit room
I'm a man of man, by no means 
King of the road, take it Slim

It takes eight hours of pushin' broom
To buy a four-by-twelve two-bit room
I'm a man of man, by no means 
King of the road, one more time

Trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No cars no pool no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

It takes eight hours of pushin' broom
To buy a four-by-twelve two-bit room
I'm a man of man, by no means 
King of the road, take it Slim

// Wolves, Lower //

Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, don't get caught
Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, let us out
Wilder, lower, wolves
Here's a house to put wolves out the door

In a corner garden, wilder, lower, wolves
House in order, house in order
House in order, house in order
Down there they're rounding a posse to ride

// Gardening At Night //

I see your money on the floor I felt the pocket change though all
The feelings that broke through that door just didn't seem to be too real

The yard is nothing but a fence the sun just hurts my eyes somewhere
It must be time for penitence gardening at night it's never worked

Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night

The neighbors go to bed at ten
Call the prayer line for a change
The charge is changing every month
They said it couldn't be arranged

We echoed up the garbage sound but they were busy in the rows
We fell up not to see the sun gardening at night just didn't grow

I see your money on the floor I felt the pocket change though all
The feelings that broke through that door just didn't seem to be too real

Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night

Your sister said that you're too young
She should know she's been there twice
The call was two and fifty-one
They said it couldn't be arranged

We echoed up the garbage sound but they were busy in the rows
We fell up not to see the sun gardening at night just didn't grow

The yard is nothing but a fence the sun just hurts my eyes somewhere
It must be time for penitence gardening at night it's never worked

Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night

// Carnival Of Sorts (Box Cars) //

There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel
Diminish, a carnival of sorts
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel
Stranger, stranger to these parts

Gentlemen don't get caught, cages under cage
Gentlemen don't get caught
Box cars are pulling out of town
Box cars are pulling out of town
Box cars are pulling out of town

Cages under, cages under, cages under cage
Cages under, cages under, cages under cage

There's a secret stigma reaping wheel
Stranger, stranger to these parts
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel
Diminish, stranger

Boxcars are pulling a carnival of sorts
Out of town, out of town

// 1,000,000 //

Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter too, smarter too
All along the tomb, all along the ruin
Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter too, smarter too

I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million years

All along, all along, all along the tomb
In secret in, in secret in, in secret in the ruin
Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter too, smarter too

// Stumble //

We'll stumble through the yard
We'll stumble through the yard
We'll stumble through the APT
We'll stumble through the yard

Force fields explorer racing home the ancient star
Yellow mixed with golden hue
Scan the graveyard dead there be

Ball and chain, ball and chain
Ball and chain, ball and chain

It was round about midnight. Hipster town. Imagine going for a walk.
Things get around to taking place. It's not a waste of time.
The rich got a little poorer.
Things get around to taking place if they're gonna happen at all.
Don't need that jazz. Don't need that stuff.
It was round about midnight. Hipster town.
It was round about midnight. Hipster town.

// All The Right Friends //

I know you say
Maybe some day
I need never be alone
I know I say
It's the right way
But you'll never be the one

I've been walking alone now
For a long, long time
I don't wanna hang out now
With the friends who just aren't mine

Party to party
You've been looking
But your search will never end
You've been hanging
With the wrong crowd
You've got all the right friends

I've been walking alone now
For a long, long time
I don't wanna hang out now
With the friends that just aren't mine

I don't wanna be with you anymore
I just don't want you anymore
I don't wanna be with you anymore
I just don't want you anymore

I don't wanna be with you anymore
I just don't want you anymore
I don't wanna be with you anymore
I just don't want you anymore
