Album: Accelerate

// Living Well Is The Best Revenge //

It's only when your poison spins into the life you'd hoped to live

That suddenly you wake up in a shaking panic - wow!

You set me up like a lamb to slaughter

Garbo as a farmer's daughter

Unbelievable, the gospel according to who?

I lay right down.


All your sad and lost apostles hum my name and flare their nostrils

Choking on the bones you toss to them

Well I'm not one to sit and spin

'Cause living well's the best revenge

Baby, I am calling you on that


Don't turn your talking points on me, history will set me free

The future's ours and you don't even read the footnote now!

So who's chasing you? Where did you go?

You disappeared mid-sentence

In a judgement crisis I see my anecdote for it

You weakened shell.


All your sad and lost apostles hum my name and flare their nostrils

Choking on the bones you toss to them

Well I'm not one to sit and spin

'Cause living well's the best revenge

Baby, I am calling you on that


You savour your dying breath

Well, I forgive but I don't forget

You work it out, let's hear that argument again

Camera three... GO NOW!


All your sad and lost apostles hum my name and flare their nostrils

Choking on the bones you toss to them

Well I'm not one to sit and spin

'Cause living well's the best revenge

Baby, I am calling you on that

Baby, I am calling you on that

Baby, I am calling you on

// Man-Sized Wreath //

Turning on the TV and what do I see?

A pageantry of empty gestures all lined up for me - wow!

I'd have thought by now we would be ready to proceed

But a tearful hymn to tug the heart

And a man-sized wreath - ow!


Throw it on the fire

Throw it in the air

Kick it out on the dance-floor like you just don't care, oh

Give me the sound


Wave the palms, steal the alms, fists in the air

A motorcade up benign shows the people that you care - ow!

Nature abhors a vacuum but what's between your ears?

Your judgement clouded with fearful thoughts

A headlights and a deer - ow!


Throw it on the fire

Throw it in the air

Kick it out on the dance-floor like you just don't care

Look at what I've found

Everybody look around

Everybody looking like they just don't care, oh

Give me the sound


Well I'm not deceived by pomp and odious conceit

But a tearful hymn to tug the heart

And a man-sized wreath-ow!


Throw it on the fire

Throw it in the air

Kick it out on the dance-floor like you just don't care

Look at what I've found

Everybody look around

Everybody looking like they just don't care


Throw it on the fire

Throw it in the air

Kick it out on the dance-floor like you just don't care, oh

Give me the sound

Give me the sound

Give me the sound

// Supernatural Superserious //

Everybody here

Comes from somewhere

That they would just soon forget

And disguise


At the summer camp where you volunteered

No one saw your face,

No one saw your fear

If that apparition had just appeared

Took you up and away

From this base and sheer


Humiliation.

Of your teenage station.


Nobody cares

No one remembers

And nobody cares


Yeah you cried and you cried

He's alive he's alive

Yeah you cried and cried and you

Cried and you cried


If you call out "safe"

Then I'll stop right away

If the premise buckles

And the ropes start to chafe

The details smart

But the story's the same

You don't have to explain,

You don't have to explain


Humiliation.

Of your teenage station.


Yeah you cried and you cried

He's alive he's alive

Yeah you cried and you cried and you

Cried and you


Realized your fantasies

Are dressed up in travesties

Enjoy yourself with no regrets


Everybody here

Comes from somewhere

That they would just as soon forget

And disguise


Yeah you cried and you cried

He's alive he's alive

Yeah you cried and you cried and you

Cried and you cried


Now there's nothing

Dark and there's nothing weird

Don't be afraid i will hold you near.

From the seance where you first betrayed

An open heart on a darkened stage.


A celebration

Of your teenage station


This

Inexperience, sweet, delirious.

Supernatural, superserious.

Inexperience, sweet, delirious.

Supernatural, superserious,

Wow.

// Hollow Man //

I've been lost inside my head,

Echoes fall off me.

I took the prize last night for complicatedness

For saying things I didn't mean and don't believe.


Believe in me, believe in nothing

Corner me and make me something

I've become the hollow man,

Have I become the hollow man I see?


Mmmmmm I see...This echoing.


You have placed your trust in me.

I went upside-down.

I emptied out the room in thirty seconds flat,

I can't believe you held your ground.


Believe in me, believe in nothing

Corner me and make me something

I've become the hollow man,

Have I become the hollow man I see?


I'm overwhelmed, I'm on repeat,

I'm emptied out, I'm incomplete.

You trusted me, I want to show you

I don't want to be the hollow man.


Believe in me, believe in nothing

Corner me and make me something

I've become the hollow man,

Have I become the hollow man I see?

I see...

// Houston //

If the storm doesn't kill me the government will

I've got to get that out of my head

It's a new day today and the coffee is strong

I've finally got some rest


So a man's put to task and challenges

I was taught to hold my head high

Collect what is mine,

Make the best of what today has


Houston is filled with promise

Laredo is a beautiful place

Galveston sings like that song that I loved

Its meaning has not been erased


And so there are claims forgiven

And so there are things that are gone


Houston is filled with promise

Laredo is a beautiful place

Galveston sings like that song that I loved

Its meaning has not been erased


And some things, they fall to the wayside

Their memory is yet to be still

Belief has not filled me

And so I am put to the test

// Accelerate //

Sinking fast, the weight chained to my feet

No time to argue with belief

I'm not alone, a thousand others dropping

Faster than me

What put me here?

Nothing to hold on to

Nowhere to brake


Where is the ripcord, the trapdoor, the key?

Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?

No time to question the choices I make

I've got to follow another direction (although fall down is much cooler)


The last thing I remember was climbing up the stairs

I threw the window open in challenge and despair

I don't know what I needed

I needed time 

I needed to escape

I saw the future turn

Upside-down and hesitate.


Where is the ripcord, the trapdoor, the key?

Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?

No time to question the choices I make

I've got to follow another direction

Accelerate.


The vista I see now is changing

Uncertainty is suffocating

Our hope has never felt so great and

Lit up down

A pounding pulse

To make it go

Make it slow down,

Go.


Where is the ripcord, the trapdoor, the key?

Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?

No time to question the choices I make

I've got to follow another direction.


The city's burning, it's like it's ready to explode

Accelerate to make it slow

Make it go

Accelerate to make it slow

Make it go

I'm incomplete

I'm incomplete

I'm incomplete.

// Until The Day Is Done //

The battle's been lost, the war is not won

An addled republic, a bitter refund

The business first flat earthers licking their wounds

The verdict is dire, the country's in ruins


Providence blinked, facing the sun

Where are we left to carry on

Until the day is done

Until the day is done


As we've written our stories to entertain

These notions of glory and bull market gain

The teleprompt flutters, the power surge brings

An easy speed message falls into routine


Providence blinked, facing the sun

Where are we left to carry on

Until the day is done

Until the day is done


A voice whispers "Son,

The blessed vision comes."

What have I done

What have I done


So hold tight your babies and your guns

Forgive us our trespasses, father and son


Providence blinked, facing the sun

Where are we left to carry on

Until the day is done

Until the day is done

Until the day is done

Until the day is done

Until the day is done

Until the day is done

// Mr. Richards //

Mr. Richards, your position

Is a messenger pigeon

Left behind you when the camp moved on.

We thought that you would listen

but the words had never crystallized 

Into a truth that you might own, hey hey.


Mr. Richards, your decision.

Pay attention, pay attention.


Mr. Richards, you're forgiven

for a narrow lack of vision

But the fires are still raging on.

The public's got opinions

and these consequences border on

The compound that you raised

Will sell it see, hey hey.


Mr. Richards, your decision.

Pay attention, pay attention.


So listen, your intention;

Sign the papers, stamp the ribbon.

You're mistaken if you think we'll just forget.


You can thump your chest and rattle,

Stand in front of your piano,

But we know what's going on.

Yes we know what's going on.

We're the children of the choir, hey

and we know what's going on.


Mr. Richards, your conviction

Had us cheering in the kitchen,

Now the jury's eating pigeon pie.

So tell me how is prison?

Have they taught you how to listen?

We've begun to bridge the schism.

Pay attention, pay attention.


Mr. Richards, your decision.

Pay attention, pay attention.


You can thump your chest and rattle,

Stand in front of your piano

But we know what's going on.

Yes we know what's going on.

We're the children of the choir, hey

From the compound fire, hey

And we know what's going on.

Yes we know what's going on.

// Sing For The Submarine //

It feels in dreams

That everything is there for you

The city breathes and pulses

It's for you electron blue


I knew that you could see right through it

So this is where I give in to the machine

Lift up your voice feel gravity's pull

Drown out the siren's ring (or silent dream)


Oh... 


It's all here where I keep it

It's all in the submarine

It's all a lot less frightening

than you would have had it be 

But that's the good news my darling

It is what it's going to be 

So sing, sing for the submarine


I tried to explain how it all begins

How its all destroyed and built again

I knew that you could not believe me

But now you're here and it's different

How the light shines in your eyes

In every second or situ

It's then that I realised

That the world as we know it

The High speed train

We'll pick it all up and start again


It's all here where I keep it

It's all in the submarine

It's all a lot less frightening

than you would have had it be 

But that's the good news my darling

It is what it's going to be 

So sing, sing for the submarine


The city did not collapse in a shudder

The rain it never came

At least my confessions made you laugh

I know it's a little crazed

But these dreams... 

they seem so real to me


It's all here where I keep it

It's all in the submarine

It's all a lot less frightening

than you would have had it be 

But that's the good news my darling

It is what it's going to be 

So sing, sing for the submarine


So this is where you trust me

And this where it begins

It's all a lot less frightening

Your tear you let it in

Tyrel and his mechanical owl

A moth disguised as a leaf... 

Don't tell me what tomorrow brings

Climb into the hidden machine and 

sing sing sing sing sing sing

sing sing for the submarine

// Horse To Water //

I could have kept my head down

I might have kept my mouth shut

I should have held my own,

You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown.


You're only as big as your battles.

Rattle my cage with your shadow.

I'm a phantom-weight with a mouth full of feathers,

Don't you know that what comes around goes around?


I'm not that easy,

I am not your horse to water.

I hold my breath I come around, round, round.


Don't darken my doorstep again,

You're mixing up living in chin-chin,

You're mixing up lose with win-win,

You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown.


You stumble on glass top table,

TV's chewing shock-gone cable

Pump me up a beanstalk fable

And I'll call this entertainment

'cause Humpty's falling down.


I'm not that easy,

I am not your horse to water.

I hold my breath I come around, round, round.


Pick a fight an ultra-buzzy bubble

Friday night fuckin' fried-up pub crawl

Phantom-weight with a mouth full of feathers,

Don't you know that what comes around goes around?


I'm not that easy,

I am not your horse to water.

I hold my breath I come around, round, round.


It's not that easy

I am not your horse to water

I hold my breath, I come around, round, round

It's going down, down, down

This runaround, round, round

Is bound to pound

The daylights out of you!

// I'm Gonna DJ //

If death is pretty final, I'm collecting vinyl
I'm gonna DJ at the end of the world

'Cos if heaven does exist with a kickin' playlist
I don't want to miss it at the end of the world

Hey steady steady, hey steady steady
I don't wanna go until I'm good and ready

It's on my mind, it's in my mind
It's what I found, it's what I find
It's on my mind, it's in my mind
It's what I found, oh my my my

When I spin my way right through it grates enthusiast Jack Pruett
As the moths circle the moon, as you're circling the room
The music will provide the light you cannot resist
You cannot resist, you cannot resist

And the weblogs that get tangled as you willy and you wangle
When you walk up in Seattle, where you fought the nascent battle
You threw the thread and throttle, let us raise another bottle
Raise another bottle, raise another bottle

Because death is pretty final, I'm collecting vinyl
I'm gonna DJ at the end of the world

Hey steady steady, hey steady steady
I don't wanna go until I'm good and ready

It's on my mind, it's in my mind
It's what I found, it's what I find
It's on my mind, it's in my mind
It's what I found, oh my my my

Hey steady steady, hey steady steady
I don't wanna go until I'm good and ready
Hey steady steady, hey steady steady
I don't wanna go until I'm good and ready

The music will provide the light you cannot resist
You cannot resist, you cannot resist
Yeah
