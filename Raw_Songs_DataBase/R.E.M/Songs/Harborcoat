They crowded up to Lenin with the noses worn off
My handshake is worthy, it's all that you've got
Metal shivs on wood pushed through our back
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads "react"

They've shifted the statues for harboring ghosts
Reddened their necks and collared their clothes
Then we ditched the books but the menace got out
She gathered the corners and called it her gown

She said, oh, please find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it
Find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it

They crowded up to Lenin with the noses worn off
A handshake is worthy, if it's all that you've got
Metal shivs on wood pushed through our back
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads "react" R.E.A.C.T.

Oh, please find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it
Find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it

They've shifted the statues for harboring ghosts
Reddened their necks and collared their clothes
Then we ditched the books but the menace got out
She gathered the corners and called it her gown

She said, oh, please find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it
Find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it
