Humming

All the way to Reno

You've dusted the non believers

And challenge the laws of chance

Now, sweet

You were so sugar sweet

You may as well have 'kick me'

Fastened on your sleeve


You know what you are

You're gonna be a star.

You know what you are

You're gonna be a star


Wing

Is written on your feet

Your achilles heel

Is a tendenc

To dream

But you've know that from the beginning

You didn't have to go so far

You didn't have to go.


You know what you are

You're gonna be a star.

You know what you are

You're gonna be a star


You know who you are

You know who you are

You know who you are


Humming

All the way to Reno

You've written your own directions

And whistled the rules of change.


You know what you are

You're gonna be a star (star)

You know what you are,

You're gonna be a star (star)

You know what you are,

You're gonna be a star (star)

You know what you are,

You're gonna be a star (star)


Humming

All the way to Reno

All the way to Reno

All the way to Reno

You're gonna be a star, you are

You're gonna be a star

You're gonna be a star, you are

You're gonna be a star
