I watched you fall.
I think I pushed.
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe diminished
Maybe I'm innocent
Maybe I'm finished
Maybe I blacked out.
How do I play this?

I will give my best today
I will give myself away
I have never hurt anything
Is the jury wavering?
Do they know I sing?

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe diminished
How do I,
How do I play this?
Jealous lover, self defence
Protective brother, chemical
Dependence.
I'll consult the i-ching
I'll consult the TV
Ouija, oblique strategies.
I'll consult the law books for
Precedents.
Can I charm the jury?

I will give my best today
I will give myself away
I have never hurt anything
Is the justice wavering?
Does she know I sing
That song?
Sing along (I will never hurt anything)
Sing along (I will never hurt anything)
Sing along (I will never hurt anything)

I watched you fall.
I think I pushed.
Maybe they'll see me,
Maybe they'll say,
"I can see the truth in his statement.
Smallpox blanket? No way."
Can I charm the jury, my defence?
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe diminished
Maybe I loved you
Baby I loved you
Baby I loved you
Baby I loved you
Baby I'm finished.

I will give my best today
I will give myself away
I have never hurt anything
Is the justice wavering?
Does she know I sing
That song?
Sing along (I will never hurt anything)
Sing along (I will never hurt anything)
Sing along (I will never hurt anything)

I have given myself away
I have given my best today
I have never hurt anything
Is the justice wavering?
Does she know I loved you
Does she know I loved you?
Does she know I sing?
