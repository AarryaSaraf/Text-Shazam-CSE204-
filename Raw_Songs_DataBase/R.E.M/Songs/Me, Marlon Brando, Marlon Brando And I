We live and dream about the future
Please ask me out, I need to pow-wow now
So through the annals of our flavoured times
Our heroes and all their fader thoughts

Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I, sing...
Lay me down, down, down, down
Lay me down, down, down, down, down

Help me off to sleep
And take me deep again

We live and dream about our heroes
I listened closely and I said
"I'm not sure where to place myself here, friend.
Am I upon the gold rings and stand?"

The winners write the rulebooks, the histories and lullabies

Lay me down, down, down, down
Lay me down, down, down, down, down

Help me off to sleep
(down, down, down)
Take me deep again
(down, down, down)
I have watched you sing
(down, down, down)
I picture glass wings in your head
(take me down, down, down)
While golden broads and combines
(down, down, down)
Or brasses mixed with lead
