With the restraint of New Order covers, young marble giants
I sat quietly waiting
For someone else to make the first move
Someone has to make the first move...

That someone is you
That someone is you
That someone has pulled me up and out of cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me!

And with the fury lock of Sharon Stone Casino
Scarface, Al Pacino
'74 Torino
Waiting for someone else to make the first move
Someone has to make the first move

That someone is you
That someone is you
That someone has pulled me up and out of cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me!

Pulled me up and out of cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me!
