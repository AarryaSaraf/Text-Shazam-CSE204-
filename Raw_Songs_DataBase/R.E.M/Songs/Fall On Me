There's the problem, feathers, iron
Bargain buildings, weights and pulleys
Feathers hit the ground
Before the weight can leave the air

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And tell the sky, and tell the sky
Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)

There's the progress
We have found a way to talk around the problem
Building towered
Foresight isn't anything at all

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And bleed the sky and tell the sky
Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
Don't fall on me
(Well I would keep it above but then it wouldn't be sky any more)
(So if I send it to you you've got to promise to keep it home)

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And lift your arms up to the sky
And ask the sky, and ask the sky
Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
