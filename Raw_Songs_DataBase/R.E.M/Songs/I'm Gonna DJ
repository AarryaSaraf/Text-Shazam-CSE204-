If death is pretty final, I'm collecting vinyl
I'm gonna DJ at the end of the world

'Cos if heaven does exist with a kickin' playlist
I don't want to miss it at the end of the world

Hey steady steady, hey steady steady
I don't wanna go until I'm good and ready

It's on my mind, it's in my mind
It's what I found, it's what I find
It's on my mind, it's in my mind
It's what I found, oh my my my

When I spin my way right through it grates enthusiast Jack Pruett
As the moths circle the moon, as you're circling the room
The music will provide the light you cannot resist
You cannot resist, you cannot resist

And the weblogs that get tangled as you willy and you wangle
When you walk up in Seattle, where you fought the nascent battle
You threw the thread and throttle, let us raise another bottle
Raise another bottle, raise another bottle

Because death is pretty final, I'm collecting vinyl
I'm gonna DJ at the end of the world

Hey steady steady, hey steady steady
I don't wanna go until I'm good and ready

It's on my mind, it's in my mind
It's what I found, it's what I find
It's on my mind, it's in my mind
It's what I found, oh my my my

Hey steady steady, hey steady steady
I don't wanna go until I'm good and ready
Hey steady steady, hey steady steady
I don't wanna go until I'm good and ready

The music will provide the light you cannot resist
You cannot resist, you cannot resist
Yeah
