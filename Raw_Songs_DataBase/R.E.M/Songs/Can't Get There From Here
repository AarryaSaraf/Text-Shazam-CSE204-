When the world is a monster bad to swallow you whole
Kick the clay that holds the teeth in, throw your trolls out the door
If you're needing inspiration, Philomath is where I go by dawn
Lawyer Jeff, he knows the lowdown, he's mighty bad to visit home 

(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 

When your hands are feeling empty, stick head jumpin' off the ground round
Tris is sure to shirr the deer out, Brother Ray can sing my song 

(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 

Hands down, Calechee bound, landlocked, kiss the ground
Dirt of seven continents going round and round
Go on ahead, Mr. Citywide, hypnotized, suit-and-tied
Gentlemen, testify 

If your world is a monster bad to swallow you whole
Philomath, they know the lowdown, throw your trolls out the door 

(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here 
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
