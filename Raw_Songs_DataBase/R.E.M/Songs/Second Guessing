Why are you trying to second guess me
I am tired of second guessing
What will be your look this season
Who will be your book this season

Oh, why are you trying to second guess me
I am tired of second guessing
Who will be your look this season
Who will be your book this season

Oh, here we are

Why are you trying to second guess me
I am tired of second guessing
What will be your look this season
Be in my club, write a book this season

Oh, here we are, here we are
Here we are, here we are
Here we are, here we are
Here we are, here we are
