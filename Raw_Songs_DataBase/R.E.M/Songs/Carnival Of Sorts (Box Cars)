There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel
Diminish, a carnival of sorts
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel
Stranger, stranger to these parts

Gentlemen don't get caught, cages under cage
Gentlemen don't get caught
Box cars are pulling out of town
Box cars are pulling out of town
Box cars are pulling out of town

Cages under, cages under, cages under cage
Cages under, cages under, cages under cage

There's a secret stigma reaping wheel
Stranger, stranger to these parts
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel
Diminish, stranger

Boxcars are pulling a carnival of sorts
Out of town, out of town
