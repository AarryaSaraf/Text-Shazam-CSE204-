she's a girl and she's loving me.
but distance is my tendency.
I am defeated.

have you lost your place? (go away, go away)
I wore my doormat face. (go away, go away, go away, go, go, go)
I hung my this or that. (go away, go away, go away, go away)
I laid my welcome mat. (go away, go away)

If I'm your oyster, where's the war?

I know you can't find a fork.
I am just a little acorn.
well, acorns grow to mighty trees.

I lay defeated.

have you lost your place? (go away, go away)
I wore my doormat face. (go away, go away, go away, go, go, go)
I hung my this or that. (go away, go away, go away, go away)

all the beauty that's trapped inside.
can't you see i love your hide?
can't you see i love your hide?
can't you see it?

have you lost your place? (go away, go away)
I wore my doormat face. (go away, go away, go away, go, go, go)
I hung my this or that. (go away, go away, go away, go away)
I laid my welcome mat. (go away, go away, go away, go, go, go)

go away, go away, go away, go away,
go away, go away
