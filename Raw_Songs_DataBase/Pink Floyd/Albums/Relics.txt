Album: Relics

// Bike //

I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like
It's got a basket, a bell that rings
And things to make it look good
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things

I've got a cloak, it's a bit of a joke
There's a tear up the front
It's red and black, I've had it for months
If you think it could look good then I guess it should

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house
I don't know why I call him Gerald
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things

I've got a clan of gingerbread men
Here's a man, there's a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish, they're on the dish

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things

I know a room of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork
Let's go into the other room and make them work

// Remember A Day //

Remember a day before today
A day when you were young
Free to play along with time
Evening never comes

Sing a song that can't be sung
Without the morning's kiss
Queen you shall be if you wish
Look for your king

Why can't we play today?
Why can't we stay that way?

Climb your favorite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother's gun
Dream yourself away

Why can't we reach the sun?
Why can't we blow the years away?

Blow away
Blow away
Remember
Remember

// Cirrus Minor //

In a churchyard by a river
Lazing in the haze of midday
Laughing in the grasses
And the graves

Yellow bird, you are not lone
In singing and in flying on
In laughing and in leaving

Willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds

On a trip to Cirrus Minor
Saw a crater in the Sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later

// The Nile Song //

I was standing by the Nile
When I saw the lady smile
I would take her out for a while
For a while

Like tears wept like a child
How her golden hair was blowing wild
Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly

Soaring high above the breezes
Going always where she pleases
She will make it to the islands
In the sun

I will follow in her shadow
As I watch her from my window
One day I will catch her eye

She is calling from the deep
Summoning my soul to endless sleep
She is bound to drag me down
Drag me down

// Paint Box //

Last night I had too much to drink 
Sitting in a club with so many fools 
Playing to rules 
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty 
I had another drink 
Drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink 

What a way to spend that evening 
They all turn up with their friends 
Playing the game 
They're in the scene I should have been 
Far away 
Away - away - away - away - away 
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before 
I open the door to an empty room 
Then I forget 

The telephone rings and someone speaks 
She would very much like to go out to a show 
So what can I do? I can't think what to say 
She sees through anyway 
Away - away - away - away - away

Out of the front door I go 
Traffic's moving rather slow 
Arriving late, there she waits 
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be 
Be - a - be - a - be - a - be - a - be
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before 
I open the door to an empty room 
Then I forget

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

// Julia Dream //

Sunlight bright upon my pillow
Lighter than an eiderdown
Will she let the weeping willow
Wind his branches 'round?

Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

Every night I turn the light out
Waiting for the velvet bride
Will the scaly armadillo
Find me where I'm hiding?

Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

Will the misty master break me?
Will the key unlock my mind?
Will the following footsteps catch me?
Am I really dying?

Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)

// Biding My Time //

Wasting my time
Resting my mind
And I'll never pine
For the sad days and the bad days
When we was working from nine to five

And if you don't mind
I'll spend my time
Here by the fire side
In the warm light of the love in her eyes

And if you don't mind
I'll spend my time
Here by the fire side
In the warm light of the love in her eyes
