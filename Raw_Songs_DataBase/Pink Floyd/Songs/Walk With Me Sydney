Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, walk with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, baby you know
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, walk with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, love to, love to

Walk with me, Sydney, it's a dark night
Come on, come on, hold me tight
Well, I'd love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-out brain

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, roll with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, baby you know
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, roll with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, love to, love to

Roll with me, Sydney, it's a dark night
Roll me, roll me, roll me high
Well, I'd love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-out brain

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, walk with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, baby you know
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, walk with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, love to, love to

Walk with me, Sydney, it's a dark night
Come on, come on, and hold me tight
Well, I'd love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-out brain
