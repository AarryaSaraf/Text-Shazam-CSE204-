Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers, point your pointers
Waddle with apples to crunchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket

Fling your arms madly, old lady with a daughter
Flat tops of houses, mouses, houses
Fiddle and Diddle as sitting bat tat
Watching the telly till all hours - telly time!
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter

Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
Waddle with apples to crunchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
