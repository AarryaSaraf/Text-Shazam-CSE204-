You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddie!

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who
Would hurt the children in any way they could

By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kid

But in the town, it was well known
When they got home at night,
Their fat and psychopathic wives
Would thrash them within inches of their lives
