(Ah) I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

"See, he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering."
