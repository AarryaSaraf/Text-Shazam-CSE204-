Doctor, doctor, I'm in bed
Doctor, doctor, aching head
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, choke on bread
Doctor, doctor, underfed
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, Jesus bled
Doctor, doctor, pain is red
Doctor, doctor, dark doom
Gruel ghoul, greasy spoon
Used spoon, June bloom

Music seems to help the pain
Seems to motivate the brain
Doctor kindly tell your wife
That I'm alive
Flowers thrive
Realise
Realise
Realise
