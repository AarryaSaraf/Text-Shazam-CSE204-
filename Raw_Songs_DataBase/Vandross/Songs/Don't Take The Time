Now and then I look at you
And feel that we ain't really
What we used to be
Love ain't easy
It seems you've been away
From loving me for such a long time
That it's no surprise that you're leaving

Well if by chance you should run into me
Don't take the time to make me cry
You've been away for quite a while
But darling so have I

Last time I saw you
You said that loving me
Was something you couldn't forget
You think you're leaving me
But it's a two way kinda feeling
That we seem to have

So if by chance you should see me dear
Don't take the time to explain why
You've been away for quite a while
'Cause darling so have I

This is the time to realize
That love didn't last forever
No no, no no
Love can be make believe, it can be fun
It's only fun when it don't go wrong

Don't tell the world that you gave me up
Because you know that it's only a lie
It's only your side
Don't say that you're leaving me
'Cause you know down in your heart
That it's only half true
I'm leaving you too

So if by chance you should run into me
Don't take the time to make me cry
You've been away for quite a while
And darling so have I
You've been away for quite a while
And darling so have I
You've been away for quite a while
And so darling have I
You've been away
And so darling have I
You've been away
And so darling have I
You've been away
And so darling have I
You've been away
And so darling have I

If you should see me
Don't take the time to make me cry
Darling
If you should pass me by
Don't take the time to make me cry
Darling
