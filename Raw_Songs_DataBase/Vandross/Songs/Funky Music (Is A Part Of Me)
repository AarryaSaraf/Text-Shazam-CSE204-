Every time I hear funky music
I just can't stand still
I've got to move
Every time I feel my motor getting in gear
Funky music is somewhere near

Funky music sure enough is a part of me
I'll do the singing
Just give me the beat from the drummer, please
Funky music, it's deep inside of me
I can't help it; I've got to move
Every time funky music comes around

Funky sounds I hear when I'm walking
It seems like everywhere I turn
I hear the funky beat
People think I'm a little crazy
'Cause they'll see me walking
Then I'll start dancing in the street (Sock it to me)

Funky music sure enough is a part of me
I'll do the singing
Just give me the beat from the drummer, please
Everybody dance to the funky sound
I go crazy, yes, I do
Every time funky music comes around

Funky music sure enough is a part of me
I'll do the singing
Just give me the beat from the drummer, please
Funky music, it's deep inside of me
I can't help it; I've got to move
Every time funky music comes around
