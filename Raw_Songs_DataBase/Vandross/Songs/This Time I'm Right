Don't know what this could be
Could it be love taking a hold on me?
There's no pain, there's no doubt
For the first time there's nothing to cry about
She wears the stars in her eyes
And she looks and she sees into this heart
I could survive after any lover
Love could go wrong one way or another
But, this time I'm right; this time I know
This time I know that it's love 'til the end
Yesterday's over, I'm starting again
And, this time I'm right; this time I know it's love
Ain't no love like she gives
And she told me that I'm the reason she lives
Comes to me all the time
I'm not just making her up in my mind
I see the stars in her eyes
And I look and I know that she sees only mine
All of my life I've been waiting for this
This is the love that I don't wanna miss
'Cause, this time I'm right; this time I know
I'm a believer in love that's for real
I don't know much, but I know what I feel
And, this time I'm right; this time I know it's love
This is it, can't waste time
'Cause I know, the one is mine
Celebrate, can't slow down
It's of r sure, love's turning me around
I could survive after any lover
Love could go wrong one way or another
But, this time I'm right; this time I know
This time I know that it's love 'til the end
Yesterday's over, I'm starting again
And, this time I'm right; this time I know it's love
All of my life I've been waiting for this
This is the love that I don't wanna miss
'Cause, this time I'm right; this time I know
I'm a believer in love that's for real
I don't know much, but I know what I feel
And, this time I'm right; this time I know it's love
