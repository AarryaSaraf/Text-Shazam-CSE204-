Ay, love don't love you 

Hey, love, ah ha


Time rushes on

And it's not fair

When someone you used to love

Is no longer there

But I think it's time you know

See love is a society

Any fool can not belong

Cuz the minute you hurt love

Then it's over and done


Love don't love you anymore

No more, shoulda never done wrong

Love don't love you anymore

No, no


Love is a ride, up and down, yeah

You did what you did to love

And I betcha know now

Cuz there's no one else around

And now you're running back to me

To forgive you your mistake

Kinda makes me sad to say but

It's a little too late


Love don't love you anymore

No more, no more, no more, no more

Love don't love you anymore

And oh love, ooo, love

Love, love's not coming home

Ain't it hard to believe

Baby, baby, baby

Love, love's not coming home, hey


It seems to be that

You're the one

The one who did bad things to love

It's sad to see, so sad to tell

But now we'll never hear the bells


Love sure don't love you 

Love sure don't want you 

Love sure don't love you 

Anymore, anymore

And it's a shame


Love sure don't love you 

No it don't

Love sure don't want you 

I know, I know

Love sure don't love you 

Anymore, anymore


Love don't love you anymore

Love sure don't love you anymore, anymore

Love don't love you baby

Love, love you anymore

Love sure don't love you anymore, anymore


It's a shame that

Love don't love you baby

Love don't love you honey

Ain't it hard to believe

No, no, no, no

Love don't love you baby

Any love don't love ya honey
