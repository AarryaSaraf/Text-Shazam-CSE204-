Hey, look at me, uncompromising me
Not the least bit affected
By the love that anyone else gives

Hey, look at me, untouchable me
Can't even be reached
Until you come around and then

This strange feeling takes me over
Leaving me weak until you're out of view
And I can't see your face anymore

Lazy, sometimes I'm lazy, baby
Sitting in my easy chair
I find satisfaction there
Whenever you look my way
Everything changes and then

This strange feeling takes me over
Leaving me weak until you're out of view
And I can't see your face anymore
