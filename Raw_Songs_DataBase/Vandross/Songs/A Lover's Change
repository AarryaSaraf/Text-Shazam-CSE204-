I'd like to be the kind of guy
Who has love in his heart
Every minute of the day and night, oh yes
I'd like to be the perfect lover

But if my heart were never wrong
You wouldn't want me very long 'cause

When in love you change
Everyday ain't the same
It's a lover's change
Feeling joy, feeling pain

From when I get up in the morning
I've got to show you how (I love you) I truly feel
 see what I feel now
For you I've got to be real
Yes I do now

Though sometimes we don't get along
My love for you is very strong 'cause

When in love you change
Everyday ain't the same
It's a lover's change
Feeling joy, feeling pain

Sometimes we kiss and hug all day
I love it when we do
But I don't always feel that way 'cause

When in love you change
Everyday ain't the same
It's a lover's change
Feeling joy, feeling pain

When in love you change
Everyday ain't the same
It's a lover's change
Feeling joy, feeling pain
