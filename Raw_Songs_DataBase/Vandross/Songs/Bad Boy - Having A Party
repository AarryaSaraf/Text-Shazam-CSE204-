Roll back the rug everybody
Move all the tables and chairs
We're gonna have us a good time tonight
Everytime that we meet
We skip and we dip to the beat, Yeah Yeah
What in the world could be better
Than getting together

The last time we had a party
It ended when the sun came up
That's why your mama told you
That you couldn't go out
Stay in the house


Bad boy
He's gonna sneak out tonight
He's gonna tip by her window
'Cause he sure wants to get out and dance
Everyone's here, let 'em all in
The chandelier downstairs has fallen
I know it's hard to resist
This is the party no one wanted to miss
But if you don't get home on the double, boy
You're going to be in trouble
I hope your mama don't look in your room
'Cause if she does she'll be here soon

Boy, she's gonna be mad
You're a bad boy and you've got it bad boy
Boy, say goodbye to your friends
'Cause it's gonna be a while til you see them again



Everybody's swingin'
Dancin' to the music
On the radio
Having a party
Everybody's swingin'
Dancin' to the music
On the radio
You can't go
