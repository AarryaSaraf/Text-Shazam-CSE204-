I had known you for quite some time
But the thought of love never crossed my mind
It seemed to be on the other side of the world

Too many times had I loved
And not cared at all about love
Just to have something to do
Then I saw a different you
And Ooh my

There's so many stories of love
All with the wonders of love
And so very sad I would be
'Cause none belonged to me

Could be it's all for the best
So I finally let it rest
Sad but I thought that maybe
Love wasn't meant for me

There was love love love on the other side of the world
So much love, so much love, so much love
Side of the world




Ain't it crazy how things can change your life
Now that love is you, everything is right
And lonliness is the other side of the world
