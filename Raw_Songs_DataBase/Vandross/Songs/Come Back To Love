I've never been alone before
And sometimes it makes me cry
But I have a feeling
That all the love
That's missing from my life
Will have a way back to me
If you come back to love

I never had to think about
The bad side of my love
But lately over and over again
I can't seem to think of nothing else
And life without love
Is scaring me to death
And I've been crying
I need someone
Come back to love

Will you come back to
The love that I'm used to
Will you come home to
The love that I'm used to
And give me the love that I count on
The love that I depend upon
That love that helps me make it through the night
And makes everything alright
Come back to love

I've never been alone before
And sometimes it makes me cry
But I have a feeling
That all the love
That's missing from my life
Will come back to me
If you come back to love

Will you come back to
The love that I'm used to
Will you come home to
The love that I'm used to

Come back to love
I need you here
I want your love, so come on
...
