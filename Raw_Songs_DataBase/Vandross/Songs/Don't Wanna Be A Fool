I was alone and blue
Until I came by you
Yeah, I was always down
Until you come around

But what I could not see
Is that you were playin' with me
Instead of happiness
You brought the misery

I couldn't face life without love
Now I see it's no good for me
From now on I'll be alone
And I won't have to be a fool anymore

Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool
So I surely will never love again
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool
We can never be more than friends

Can't help remembering
Some of the better things
Like when we used to do
The things we loved to do

This really can't be real
Because you made me feel
That I had everything
That happiness could bring

I thought that it was all a lie
When they told me that you were payin' around
You know it really makes me cry
When I think about how you brought me down

Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool
So I surely will never love again
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool
We can never be more than friends

Oh baby
Oh oh
I'll never love again (Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool)
We can't be more than friends (Can't be a fool, my baby)
Cause there's a million broken-hearted people in the world (Can't be a fool)
That's why I can't be a fool, no (Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool)
And that's for love (Can't be a fool, my baby)
There's not enough guarantee on it, yeah (Can't be a fool)
True love is hard to find (Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool)
And it ain't every day (Can't be a fool, my baby)
That you can get it, get it, get it, get it all (Can't be a fool)
(Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool)
That's why I can't be a fool, no (Can't be a fool, my baby)
I can't be a fool, no no (Can't be a fool)
(Don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool)
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool no
(Can't be a fool)
No oh
(Can't be a fool)
Can't be a fool
