Hey ay...

Look, Heart, please don't you fail on me now, keep your composure somehow
Beaten down, cause your movin' much too fast
You, you smiled and from the first glance I didn't stand half a chance
No-contest in the battle with you hypnotizing loveliness

I lose all control, around and around I spin, head over heels
I don't know which way is up
But there's one thing I do know, that each day I want you more and more
Now I've tasted the potion, I'm under the spell of the magic we call love
And I can't get enough of...

Feels so good babe from the start, and it feels so good to be wrapped in your arm
Oh, I feel the thrill of new found love, and I don't want to lose this feeling
Fix me in the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in

Hey ay ay ayee...

Flash, wavin' a full surrender, to love you give so tender
Soft serenade of your voice when you come near and whisper

I lose all control, around and around I spin, head over heels
I don't know which way is up
Cause there's no place I'd rather be
Then somewhere I go just you and me
Cause I've tasted the potion, I'm under the spell of the magic we call love
And I can't get enough of...

Feels so good babe from the start, and it feels so good to be wrapped in your arm
Oh, I feel the thrill of new found love, and I don't want to lose this feeling
Fix me in the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in

Feels so good babe, from the start and it feels so good said it feels so good
It's the thrill I feel of a new found love. And I don't want to lose this feeling
Fix me in the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in

I don't know how she puts me in a spin
I lost my heart to her but I still win
Every time I'm wrapped up in her arm

Ayy ayy hey...

It's the thrill, feels alright
I feel alright, I feel alright, I feel alright, I feel alright

It's the thrill, feels alright
I feel alright, I feel alright, I feel alright, I feel alright

It's the thrill, feels alright
I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright...
