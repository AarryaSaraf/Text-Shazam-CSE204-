I coulda died when I found out
We couldn't live together peacefully
That's when it started and we nearly parted 
Well, I was hoping not to see the day
We started getting in each other's way 
Maybe it's better we don't live together
Things got strange 
My space to chill become half the size
You became someone
I didn't even recognize
What's the matter now 
What are you talking about 
If it ain't one thing, it's another
If it ain't one thing, it's the other 
Why you gotta put me down 
What are you complaining about 
If it ain't one thing, it's the other
If it ain't one thing, it's another   
I got a yacht for a dinner cruise 
The way you treated everyone was rude
I don't believe ya, you're such a diva
I told the waitress we wanted wine
You got upset because the girl was fine
You're complicated, but somehow we make it
I get tired 
From all I have to do to keep you satisfied 
Get no sleep 
You call me in the middle of the night and weep 
What's the matter now  
What are you crying about 
If it ain't one thing, it's another
If it ain't one thing, it's the other 
Why you gotta fuss and shout 
What are you screaming about 
If it ain't one thing, it's the other
If it ain't one thing, it's another 
I guess I can't see the world through your eyes 
Pretty little brown eyes 
Guess I don't understand 
What goes on, goes on, goes on in your mind
What's the matter now 
What are you talking about 
If it ain't one thing, it's another
If it ain't one thing, it's the other 
Why you gotta put me down 
What are you fussing about 
If it ain't one thing, it's the other
If it ain't one thing, it's another
What's the matter now  
What are you talking about 
If it ain't one thing, it's another
If it ain't one thing, it's the other 
Why you gotta scream and shout 
What are you complaining about 
If it ain't one thing, it's the other
If it ain't one thing, it's another
