I lay awake every night
Trying to find a reason
Why jealousy possesses me
Even when you're teasin'
Fire is in my mind
My whole world is burnin', burnin'
Jealousy possesses me
Keeps me tossin' and turnin'

The jealousy has got a hold on me
Everytime I see you walkin'
With somebody else
I get crazy, baby
Stone cold crazy, baby

I'm alone again at night
But it leaves me time for thinking
Why jealousy possesses me
Where are you this evening?
All of my life
I've had this jealous way
Jealousy will be the end of me
Where are you today?

Jealousy is in me
Everytime I see you walkin'
With somebody else
I get crazy, baby
Stone cold crazy, baby
I get crazy, baby
Stone cold crazy, baby

My heart's filled with jealousy
Everytime I see you walkin'
With somebody else
I get crazy (jealousy)
Stone cold crazy (jealousy)
Jealousy

Everytime I see you walkin'
With somebody else
I get crazy (jealousy)
Stone cold crazy (jealousy)

Tell me, tell me why
My heart's filled with jealousy
Oh yes it is, oh yes it is
Everytime I see you walkin' down the street
My heart's filled with jealousy

Oh yes it is
Everytime I see
You walkin' down the street
My heart's filled with jealousy
Oh yes it is, oh yes it is

Take it away
Everyday in every way
Jealousy has got a hold on me
Mercy, mercy
Cause' jealousy has got a hold on me
Jealousy

Take it away...
