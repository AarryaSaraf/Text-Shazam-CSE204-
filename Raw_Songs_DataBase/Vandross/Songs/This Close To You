It's funny how I used to see you every day
But on one particular day I looked over at you in the usual nonchalant way
And it seemed as if I had never seen you before
It felt strange that I used to deny your existence
And then it dawned on me that I had never been

This close to you
I feel the strange and eery vibrations of love
This close to you
Is like a breezy summer day
And for the first time
I feel the compulsion to say hello, ooh

Well I'm the one that you've talked about in song
You've been going out of your head
And I never knew what you were up to
I apologize for making you wait so long
You've been very, very kind
And I feel kinda crazy, baby, crazy, crazy

This close to you
Has made this a strange and ominous day
Ooh, my love, is this an omen telling me
That I should run for love
I never thought that I'd be in love
And I never thought that I'd want to be
This close to you

It ain't never even crossed my mind
That I'd want to be this close to you
It ain't never even crossed my mind
That I'd want to be this close to you
It ain't never even crossed my mind
That I'd want to be this close to you
It ain't never even crossed my mind
That I'd want to be...

I never knew, never never
Never, no
I never knew that I'd want to be
That I'd want to be this close to you
