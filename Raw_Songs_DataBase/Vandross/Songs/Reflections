Through the mirror of my mind

Time after time

I see reflections of you and me


Reflections of the way life used to be

Reflections of the love you took from me


I'm all alone now

No love to shield me

Trapped in a world that's

a distorted reality.


Happiness you took from me

and left me alone

with only memories.


Through the mirror of my mind

Through these tears that I'm crying

Reflects the hurt I can't control

Cause although you're gone

I keep holding on

to the happy times

ooh when you were mine


AS I peer out through the window

of lost time

Looking over my yesteryear

And all this love I gave all in vain


(all the love) All the love I've wasted

(all those tears) All the tears that I've tasted

(ooh ,ooh) All in vain

(all in vain, till nothing remains)


Through the hollow of my tears

I see a dream that's lost

From the hurt

That you have caused


Everywhere I turn

seems like everything I see

Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put all my faith and trust

and right before my eyes my world has turned to dust


After all those nights I sat alone and wept

Just a hand full of promises and all that's left of loving you


Reflections of

the way life used to be

Reflections of

the love you took from me

in you I put all my faith and trust

right before my eyes my world was turned to dust

Reflections of...
