Yeah, yeah
Here it is

She caught me by surprised I must say
Cause I never have seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style
I was fascinated, surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

 - Excuse me miss
But what's your name
Where are you from and can I come
And possibly, can I take you out tonight

To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark
So let me know, can I take you out tonight

Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact I missed the chance for romance
At least I'll walk away knowing
I tried my best and I'm going
I'm going on with my day
Cause at least she heard me say





That's why I had to come over
And introduce myself to you
Cause you're never gonna know 
Where you'll find love, oh yeah
And hopefully I found it in you, yeah
