There was a time when I didn't have no one, didn't have no love
Do you remember the love that we once had
Well if I had the chance to love you again
I would make your heart forget I was ever there
If we forget the past
I know this time love will last forever, for always, for love

I'm not coming home anymore, doesn't matter
Well if I had the chance to hold you again
I'd fill your heart with joy and make you remember
I'm the only one for you, yes I would
Let's throw the bad memories out and make this the first day
Forever, for always, for love

I'd be a fool to ever change
If she says she loves me the way I am
I'd be a fool to ever change
If she says she loves the, loves the way I am
It's gonna be starting here, starting now, yeah yeah yeah
Forever, for always
Do it for the ones you love, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Forever, for always, keep it right there, keep it right there
Yeah, for always, for love, yeah yeah yeah
Forever, always, for love, hey hey hey
Forever, for always, yeah yeah yeah
For always, for love, hey hey hey
For love, forever, for always, for love
Forever, for always, for love, hey
