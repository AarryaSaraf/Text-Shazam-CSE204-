What's up my people?
You know
I am your weather man Busta Rhymes
I've come today to give you your weather forcast
you know today looks like one of those beautiful days
you know? to be perfectly honest,
there aint a cloud in the sky
you know this is the kind of weather you take your girl to the beach
lay her down and talk to her
Luther, step to the microphone

When i wake up in the morning love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
something strange without a one in love
That is heavy on my mind
then i look at you
and the world is alright with me
just one look at you
and i know it's gonna be


a lovely day
oohh..
a lovely day
it's gonna

when the day that lies ahead of me
seems impossible to face
when somebody else instead of me
always seems to know the way
then i look at you
and the world is alright with me
just one look at you
and i know it's gonna be

a lovely day (lovely day, lovely day, lovely, come on come on
a lovely day
say it
say it

(it's gonna be a lovely day) it's gonna be
it's gonna be today ooohh yeah
(it's gonna be a lovely day) today i love the world, and i love you yeah


Huh

and park under a lamp post
recline your seat, relax and lets listen to Mr. Vandross
I'm watching how my mami watching her do
creatin a situation to put us right in the mood
i've got plenty suggestions on things we can maybe do
especially when we rockin the songs we make babies to
you know the way we do baby
and as we lay i look at you
i sit back and think how today was such a lovely day

(Lovely day, lovely day lovely day come on come on)
It's gonna be a lovely day
oooh yeah

(it's gonna be a lovely day) it's gonna be
(it's gonna be) today
