Last time you thought of him, he thought of you

And it proves the magic was for real

Just then the winds of change

Brought down the falling rain, so unexpected

What should you do


Now, you've got plans to change, some things to rearrange

Scared of tomorrow, scared of right now too

See, it's all very sad

Can't deny you feel bad

But I just don't want you to let this thing take you over


Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because

Everything can be the way that it was

But keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown

Everyone says that you'll come back around

But, not if you fall too far down


No one really knows

When their clouds will go away

That's why they say we should always save

For a rainy day


Someone made some promises that didn't keep

It set you up just to let you down

Be careful not to let it push you around

And you'll be okay, if you take one day by one day

See, I just don't want you to

Let this thing take you over


Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because

Most of your life can be the way that it was

But, keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown

Everyone thinks that you'll come back around

But, not if you fall too far down



Too far down is where you fall when you don't care no more

But, what about love

Isn't it worth living for

You don't know


Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because

Everything can be the way that it was

But keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown

Everyone says that you'll come back around

But, not if you fall too far down


You're not the only one, who's love and whose lost

So many people, too, know they've all paid the cost

The thing that we learn is how to get a smile from a frown

Go ahead ifyou want, stumble and fall

But, don't fall honey too far down
