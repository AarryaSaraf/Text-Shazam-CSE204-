I can hear you sighin'
Sayin' you'll stay beside me
Why must it be that you always
Creep into my dreams

On the beach we're sitting,
Huggin' squeezin', kissin'
Why must it be that you always
Creep into my dreams

When I'm sleep at night, baby
I feel those moments of ectasy
When you sleep at night, baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy
Oh love is so amazing (Oh oh oh oh)
Guess you will be stayin'
So let it be that you always
Creep into my dreams
