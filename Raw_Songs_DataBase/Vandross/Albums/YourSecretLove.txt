// Your Secret Love //

Oh, yes
A kiss in the dark
A certain time I can call you
A letter of love
But no name did you sign
Pretending to all
That we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be
I didn't know that you wanted me for your
(For your) To be

[1] - Your secret love
Why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves
Never last as long
Your secret love
Will never be your true love
I can't be no secret baby
It's breakin' my heart
(You're breaking my heart)

You should've let me know, from the first time baby
That you were not, were not free to love
How could you wait so long
Oh, what a waste of love, baby
I should known that you wanted me to be
I should known
That you wanted me for your (for your) to be
[repeat 1]

I won't be you secret love
'Cause it's just a waste of my love
I'm tellin' you from the start
I won't be the one who gives you love
When your other guy ain't givin' you none

Don't come now, wait for awhile
Let's meet at the place downtown
It's a shame it has to be like this
But I really miss you baby
[rpt 1, 1]

// Love Don't Love You Anymore (TM's Urban Mix) //

Ay, love don't love you 
Hey, love, ah ha

Time rushes on
And it's not fair
When someone you used to love
Is no longer there
But I think it's time you know
See love is a society
Any fool can not belong
Cuz the minute you hurt love
Then it's over and done

Love don't love you anymore
No more, shoulda never done wrong
Love don't love you anymore
No, no

Love is a ride, up and down, yeah
You did what you did to love
And I betcha know now
Cuz there's no one else around
And now you're running back to me
To forgive you your mistake
Kinda makes me sad to say but
It's a little too late

Love don't love you anymore
No more, no more, no more, no more
Love don't love you anymore
And oh love, ooo, love
Love, love's not coming home
Ain't it hard to believe
Baby, baby, baby
Love, love's not coming home, hey

It seems to be that
You're the one
The one who did bad things to love
It's sad to see, so sad to tell
But now we'll never hear the bells

Love sure don't love you 
Love sure don't want you 
Love sure don't love you 
Anymore, anymore
And it's a shame

Love sure don't love you 
No it don't
Love sure don't want you 
I know, I know
Love sure don't love you 
Anymore, anymore

Love don't love you anymore
Love sure don't love you anymore, anymore
Love don't love you baby
Love, love you anymore
Love sure don't love you anymore, anymore

It's a shame that
Love don't love you baby
Love don't love you honey
Ain't it hard to believe
No, no, no, no
Love don't love you baby
Any love don't love ya honey

[Ad lib until fade]

// It's Hard For Me To Say //

Didn't know 'til today
That you would love for me to say
All of things I feel
Though you don't doubt they're real
Insecure, very shy
Are the only reasons I have why
I never say the things that you would love to hear
All the words I try
Disappoint me and I cry
So they're words I don't always say, but
It's in my love, it's in my feeling
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit
And it's got me totally high
It's just hard for me to say why
Kinda sad, kinda blue
Because I wanted to tell you
That you were in my heart
Though we were far apart
Didn't know how to say
All the little things to make you stay
And not to keep assuming
You could read my mind
You're the one I love
Though it's hard for you to know
'Cause the words I don't always say, but
It's in my love, it's in my feeling
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit
And it's got me totally high
It's just hard for me to say why

// Crazy Love //

We can't change the way we were
But we can change the way we are
All I really wanted
From this crazy love
Was a night so full of stars
That our hearts could not pretend
Oh what I wouldn't give
To have that crazy love again
I believe in second chances
And I'm holding on for sure
To your crazy love
To your crazy love
Crazy love
I lived my l life for you
But now I'm left with me
Hanging on to pieces
Of what used to be
And no matter how I try
When I feel another's touch
It brings me back to why
I miss our crazy love so much
I believe in second chances
And I'm holding on for sure
To your crazy love
To your crazy love
Crazy love
Yes I believe in second chances
And I'm holding on for sure
To our crazy love
It was crazy love

// I Can Make It Better //

Well, once again my love
It's time for you to go
No need to explain anything
I know, I know, I know

This is the end of the road
It's the parting of the ways
And there's not much left for us to say

You keep telling me he's no good for you 
You said you were gonna change your lock
You told me if he bothers you again, baby
He'll be dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Put him away, baby
Make him understand
Tell him his game is over
And then when you cry, I'll be your shoulder

Whatever you're going through
I can make it better
No one should be making you feel like you do
I can make it better
Oh baby, baby
Don't be a link in his chain
Tell him you want to be free, you want to love me
Don't let him get in the way

For every one time that he gives you pleasure 
Ten times he makes you wanna cry
You spend every night with the toss and the turn, baby
And wonder why in the world, oh why
How in the world can you get any sleep
Every one knows the way that he creeps
It's time for the question baby
What has he done for you lately, no

Whenever you want me to
I can make it better
I just need this one chance to prove it to you 
I can make it better
Ooo baby, baby
Don't be a pawn in his game
Go 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go
Or darling, it's just a shame

Better for you is better for me
Let's fall in love, I'll make you see
Better for you is better for me, baby
Let's fall in love, I'll make you, I'll make you see

Never again will you hear a lie
Never again will you wanna cry
never, oh no, will there be a tear drop in your eye
Stop all this madness in the name of love
Tell him to leave cuz enough is enough
Let him go baby, save your love for me
Tell him you've found somebody
Who'll give you the love that you just won't believe

// Too Proud To Beg //

Love came to me that day
Stayed longer than I planned
But change is good, they say
So I rearranged my world for them
For her and love and, here I go again
I spoke to my heart
Said, "Open up wide"
Then got the message you had changed your mind
And now here I am and I just don't understand
Baby, if you talk to me then I will listen
There can't be no "us" honey, if "you" are missin'
Yes I love you, yes I need you
ain't no world for me without you
I want you, I'm just too proud to beg
So sad the journey made
So high the price we have to pay
All for love...
And it hurts you anyway
I can't lose my soul to hope and wishing
You don't understand me, I know that you think...
I don't love you, I don't need you
But, my intentions are to love you
See, I want you, I'm just too proud...
To beg for your love
So don't put me through it
Take a little time to think about what you're doing
And try to understand why...
Yes I love you, yes I need you
ain't no world for me without you
I want you, I'm just too proud to beg
So sad the journey made
So high the price we have to pay
All for love...
And it hurts you anyway

// I Can't Wait No Longer (Let's Do This) //

Now I been gone, for sometime baby
But I been thinkin' of you, the whole time through
The thought of your love got me excited
And now that all the waitin' is done
It's time to have some fun my baby

[Chorus:]
Baby I love you so
I wanna love you head to toe
I can't wait, no I can't wait no longer
Come on baby, let's do this
You were my lover and my friend
I wanna love you 'til the end
To the very end, girl
I can't wait, no I can't wait no longer
So come on baby, let's do this, yeah

Now you know I'm - I'm not complicated
I only need you my sweet baby and your love to drive me crazy
Now that I'm back you better get ready
Cause I saved it all for you
I'm gonna love you through and through my baby

[Chorus]

I waited so long to get to this
Come on baby, let's do this, yeah

Ha, ha wait a minute Mr. Vandross
You say you been gone so long you need a dose
But, oh no that coming and going, it's got to go
Check my flow
You say you want this,
Well baby this you besta know
Spinderella ain't ain't new to this
I need my man to be true tho this,
So work it out, lace this if you can
And stay around - you the man
And I need you to be down

[Chorus]

// Nobody To Love //

Hey baby, what's your game?
I ask you the question and the answer's still the same
How can you go on day to day
Without someone to care
If I wanted to take that chance
If I wanted to be your man
You tell me that you feel lonely
But you won't love nobody
You tell me that you got a big heart
But you won't love no one
You lie and you moan and you bitch and you groan
But you won't let nobody in to love
What am I gonna do?
Hey there baby, you're not shy
We talk for hours and you seem just fine girl, but...
Every time I bring up love
You run for cover
Suppose I told you something that's true
Suppose I told you that I want you
You tell me all the guys want you
But you won't love nobody
You keep your heart in seclusion
And you won't love no one
You game and you flirt and you talk a lot of dirt
But you don't want nobody to love
What are you gonna do?
Heart feels empty, there's no one home
Nights are longer when you're alone
You tell me that you feel lonely
But you won't love nobody
You tell me that you got a big heart
But you won't love no one
You lie and you moan and you bitch and you groan
But you won't let nobody in to love
What am I gonna do?
You tell me all the guys want you
But you won't love nobody
You keep your heart in seclusion
And you won't love no one
You game and you flirt and you talk a lot of dirt
But you don't want nobody to love
What are you gonna do?

// Whether Or Not The World Gets Better //

We don't play any games, my girl and I
We get by on the high of love
And there's no time to spend on doubt or wondering
'Cause no one else could I ever love
You see the world outside can be cold and very lonely
And it gets real bad
And it makes me sad, but
Whether or not the world gets better
You and I and love will be together, together
Whether or not the world gets better
You and I will truly survive
And it's all because our love will never die
Never ever die
We all live in a crazy world today
There's so much beauty and yet there's so much pain
And we'd be wiser to make a change, with love we could
It's our world, we should make it good
And if the world outside gets too cold and feels too lonely
And it gets real bad
It'll still make us sad
Whether or not the world gets better
You and I and love will be together, together
Whether or not the world gets better
You and I will truly survive
And it's all because our love will never die
Never ever die
Our love is out world
And it keeps us safely from anything outside that could hurt us
We look out from inside
And depending on what we see
We just hold each other tightly, hold me tightly
'Cause sometimes it's just better to let it be
Whether or not the world gets better
You and I and love will be together, together
Whether or not the world gets better
You and I will truly survive
And it's all because our love will never die
Never ever die

// This Time I'm Right //

Don't know what this could be
Could it be love taking a hold on me?
There's no pain, there's no doubt
For the first time there's nothing to cry about
She wears the stars in her eyes
And she looks and she sees into this heart
I could survive after any lover
Love could go wrong one way or another
But, this time I'm right; this time I know
This time I know that it's love 'til the end
Yesterday's over, I'm starting again
And, this time I'm right; this time I know it's love
Ain't no love like she gives
And she told me that I'm the reason she lives
Comes to me all the time
I'm not just making her up in my mind
I see the stars in her eyes
And I look and I know that she sees only mine
All of my life I've been waiting for this
This is the love that I don't wanna miss
'Cause, this time I'm right; this time I know
I'm a believer in love that's for real
I don't know much, but I know what I feel
And, this time I'm right; this time I know it's love
This is it, can't waste time
'Cause I know, the one is mine
Celebrate, can't slow down
It's of r sure, love's turning me around
I could survive after any lover
Love could go wrong one way or another
But, this time I'm right; this time I know
This time I know that it's love 'til the end
Yesterday's over, I'm starting again
And, this time I'm right; this time I know it's love
All of my life I've been waiting for this
This is the love that I don't wanna miss
'Cause, this time I'm right; this time I know
I'm a believer in love that's for real
I don't know much, but I know what I feel
And, this time I'm right; this time I know it's love

// Knocks Me Off My Feet //

I see us in the park strolling the summer days
Of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind of even
Without being said

I don't want to bore you with my troubles
But there's something bout your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet

There's something bout your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
Oh baby said you knock me off my feet

I don't to bore you with it
Oh But I love you I love you I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh But I love you I love you I love you

More and more
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen
Through the eyes of my mind

I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you baby
That only our two hearts can find

But I don't want to bore you with
The troubles

But there's something bout your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet

There's something bout your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
Oh baby said you knock me off my feet

I don't to bore you with it
Oh But I love you I don't to bore you with it
Oh But I love you I love you I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh But I love you I love you I love you

// Goin' Out Of My Head //

Well I think I'm going out of my head
Yes I think I'm going out of my head over you, over you
I want you to want me I need you so badly
I can't think of anything but you yeah
And I think I'm going out of my head
Cause I can't explain these tears that I shed
Baby over you over you

You don't even notice I exist
