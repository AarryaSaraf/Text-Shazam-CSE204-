Album: NeverLetMeGo

// Emotion Eyes //

Tears on your pillow, that's evidence
Crying all night, it don't make no sense
Never know what to do, so the tears come out
I used to wonder what this thing was all about

You're so sensitive
So willing to give
Girl, you're just a cutie, yeah yeah
But everything hits your tender spot
I think I see just what you've got

[Chorus:]
Emotion eyes see what they wann see
They just won't let it be
There's always somethnig goin' on

Emotion eyes, can't seem to be without
Something to cry about
They just get so emtional

My, oh, mercy me, just what do you see
Nothing stops those tears from coming
What's the matter chile, don't you ever smile
Watching you is really something

You don't need to struggle with you badness
'Cause you're the baddest girl there'll ever be
You've got to learn to compromise
You've got to dry your weeping eyes
Watch what you see with those ...

[Chorus]

You don't need to struggle with your badness
You're just the baddest girl there'll ever be
You've got to learn to compromise
You've got to dry your weeping eyes
Watch what you do with those

[Chorus]

// Little Miracles (Happen Every Day) //

One thing I would love to do
Is talk to someone
Wish I knew who
Sometimes the people who know the least say the most
Makes you wonder who you can trust
What's gonna happen

The first thing I know
God is love
The next thing would be
He loves me
Sometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone
Then I stop and see what He's done
And I know everything will come

And it maybe today
Anything can change, nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What's tomorrow for
No one knows for sure
Through it all come may
Little miracles happen everyday

And so there you go
Strangely enough
Alone even so
Addicted to love
You're in and out so quickly
That it gives you a start
You're waiting for a message or a word
But you haven't heart from your heart

But it might be today
Anything can change
Nothing stays the same
And maybe today
For the love in me
I really believe
Through it all come what may
Little miracles happen everyday

What is a miracle
Love is a miracle
Every time that you care
Miracles happen somewhere
So many miracles
Even small little miracles
Just take one look about
It's not hard to figure out

Cause it might be today
Anything can change
Nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What's tomorrow for
No one knows for sure
Through it all come what may
Little miracles happen everyday
Little miracles happen everyday

// Heaven Knows //

Heaven knows I love you
Heaven knows how much I care
Couldn't live without you
Look for me and I'll be there

But, even though you're a joy to me
I think you think, "he's a bore to me"
What your thing, am I still your guy?
I'm so confused, my darling, I could die

You're the one on my mind
Got me working overtime
I only think about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you...
I try to love you

Used to be amazing
Used to make the world say "wow"
Heaven brought us together
That's how I know it'll all work out

We bulit our love on a solid ground
And can't a thing ever bring us down
Back together like we wanted to
Forget me not, 'cause I remember you

You're still the one on my mind
Love is working overtime
I only dream about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven know I really try to love you...
I try to love you, yeah

You're the one on my mind
Got me working overtime
I only think about love, don't you?
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you...
I try to love you, baby

This is love that you can't ignore
I never knew a girl like you before
And heaven knows I couldn't love you more...

This is so right
This is so right
This is so right
Because I love you
I really love you, baby

Back together like we wanted to
Forget me not, 'cause I remember you

Work, it can work
Gonna work out, gonna work out
Work, its going work
Gonna work out, gonna work it out
Work, its gonna work, 'cause I love
Heaven knows and I know it can...

// Love Me Again //

What are we saying
For what are we praying
Using the words we both wanna hear

What are we doing
The whole thing is proving
We're feeling the same way we always did

So, here we go once again
It's just like back when
I clearly remember the way we were then
So come back and love me again

[Chorus 1:]
I was the one who adored you
And I waited all this time for you
But, you can't tell love what to do
It's so hard, but it's true
You used to love me completely
And I'd really love you to need me
So darling, tell me you can find the way
Find a way to love me, again

I've heard the stories of hearts that get broken
But, if we take it slowly it won't have to be
One step at a time heart, too fast and it all'll fall apart
I know we're survivors, but I'll speak for me

Even as strong as I am
I don't think I can
Lost outside the world
I don't know just where I stand
So hurry back girl and love the boy, again

[Chorus 2:]
I was the one who adored you
And I'd wait a million years for you
But, you can't tell love where to go
This is one thing that we know

You used to love me completely
And I'd really love you to need me
So darling, tell me you can find the way
Find a way to love me again

[Repeat:]
(Find any way that you can, love me again)
Over and over, I swear, I need you, need you, need you girl
(Just think it over and then, love me again)

[Fade]

// Can't Be Doin' That Now //

Ready or not
You're gonna get a taste of love

So, if you've got a change of heart
Stop that before you start
None of this holding back
I thought you knew that

[Chorus:]
You'can't be doin' that now
Stop it right away
You can't be doin' that now
'Cause I need a little kindness
A little, a little tenderness
A little love somehow

Other loves you've had
Are just a thing of the past
All a part of yesterday
Forever and far away

But, never will I disappear
My love is gonna stay right here
So, none of this pulling back
I thought you knew that

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
What's it about, my love, my love
What's on your mind, now baby love
Answer my call, I'm callin'
Don't stop now that Ive fallen

Don't let a good thing get away
We've got forever and a day
To make the whole thing better
That's why I'm gonna leave you never

[Instrumental]

[Chorus and Fade]

// Too Far Down //

Last time you thought of him, he thought of you
And it proves the magic was for real
Just then the winds of change
Brought down the falling rain, so unexpected
What should you do

Now, you've got plans to change, some things to rearrange
Scared of tomorrow, scared of right now too
See, it's all very sad
Can't deny you feel bad
But I just don't want you to let this thing take you over

Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because
Everything can be the way that it was
But keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown
Everyone says that you'll come back around
But, not if you fall too far down

No one really knows
When their clouds will go away
That's why they say we should always save
For a rainy day

Someone made some promises that didn't keep
It set you up just to let you down
Be careful not to let it push you around
And you'll be okay, if you take one day by one day
See, I just don't want you to
Let this thing take you over

Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because
Most of your life can be the way that it was
But, keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown
Everyone thinks that you'll come back around
But, not if you fall too far down

[Bridge:]
Too far down is where you fall when you don't care no more
But, what about love
Isn't it worth living for
You don't know

Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because
Everything can be the way that it was
But keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown
Everyone says that you'll come back around
But, not if you fall too far down

You're not the only one, who's love and whose lost
So many people, too, know they've all paid the cost
The thing that we learn is how to get a smile from a frown
Go ahead ifyou want, stumble and fall
But, don't fall honey too far down

[Fade]

// Love Is On The Way (Real Love) //

I could write a book on love
The way you make me feel
I never knew someone
Could have a love so real

Call it a special heart
Call it a love so true
But, in a little while I'm getting close to you

[Chorus:]
See, I'm about to lose my mind
(Love is on the way)
I'm so excited, it's a crime
(Love is on the way)
It's gonna be real love
Real love, oh love

Calling up all my friends
To tell them how right they've been
They said you would take me back into your arms again
Gonna do right this time, I like the way it feels
I don't wanna ask too much
Just wanna feel you touch

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I'm all excited
(Love is on the way)
I'm so delighted
(Love is on the way)
'Cause love is comin'
(Love is on the way
And I've been waiting for the day for love to come
(Love is on the way)
My heart is flyin'
(Love is on the way)
There's no denynig
(Love is coming)
Oh love

See, I'm about to lose my mind
(Love is on the way)
I'm so excited, it's a crime
(Love is on the way)
It's gonna be real love
Real love, oh love

I get a second chance today
(Love is on the way)
It's really true love and I can say
(Love is on the way)
It's gonna be real love, real love

Well, I'm about to lose control
(Love is on the way)
'Cause love is coming, don't you know
(Love is on the way)
It's gonna be real love, real love

I know for sure that this is it
(Love is on the way)
Can't talk to you now, there's love to get
(Love is on the way)
It's gonna be real love, real love

[Fade]

// Hustle //

[Spoken:]
I love when the day is new
We get to start all over
But the thing is sometimes getting through the day
Is just one big hustle

The world is waiting, dawn is here
Ain't got time to waste, we need to work, my dear
Hurry, hurry can't delay
Get up and start today, it's time to...

[Chorus:]
Hustle
Oh, trying to keep things together
Working all day, finding a way... to hustle
Soon I'll be back to you
But first I got a lot to do

We learn to fight to survive
And that's how we manage to stay alive
Then we lwt the night settle in
Then I get to see my bab again

I know you're waiting patiently
You're home beofre I am, and so you wait for me
Anticipatin', I rush I do
I'm coming back to you, I've got to

Hustle
Oh, I can't stay in this place
I've got to see my baby's face (Hustle)
Sure as I breathe and live
I've got a lot of love to give

You're my lady, I'm your man
Let's turn the music up
I think it's time to dance
Night has fallen
Spirits rise
Ain't no compromise, we came to...

Hustle
Up all night, don't stop yet
Just let the music make you sweat and
Hustle
Forget about the work we do
I just wanna be with you

[Fade]

// Lady, Lady //

They may say that we're the best thing that could be
They say it to you and they say it to me
But to each other they're insistin'
Something must be missin'
Things can't really be the way they seem to be

They don't know love the way we do
They've never loved someone like you

[Chorus:]
Lady Lady, I never let them talk about you
Lady Lady, 'cause you're mine
Lady Lady, I jump up when they talk about you
But so what, I'm gonna be your guy

You can never win
Once that stuff begins
'Cause when it starts, its just never ends
Popple start rumors about you
Say those things about you
But I won't ever doubt you
You're my best friend

Let them be how they wanna be
They can't stop you from loving me

[Chorus]

[Spoken:]
So you see, I don't care what they say, I don't care what they do
I'm the one who loves you, I'm the one you need, I'm the one ...

A symphony plays when you are near
And I love the music that I hear

[Chorus and Fade]

// Never Let Me Go //

Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
My darling, won't you hold me tight
And never let me go

Dry your eyes
No tears, no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might
And never let me go

A million times or more
We said we'd never part
But lately I find
You're a stranger, stranger in my heart

Give me the right
In summer or in spring time
To tell the world you are mine
And you will never let me go
And never let me go

[Fade]
