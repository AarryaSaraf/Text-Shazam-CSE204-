// Love The One You're With //

There's a Rose

In a fisted Glove

and the eagle flies 

with the dove

and if you can't be 

with the one you love

it's alright

Go ahead and love the one, 

love the one, 

love the one your with

love the one, 

love the one, 

love the one your with

If your guy can't come to you

and you don't remember 

who your talking to

your concentration slips away

because your baby, 

she is so so far away
[Chorus:]

And there's a rose 

in a fisted glove

and the eagle flies 

with the dove

and if you can't be 

with the one you love

love the one your with

Don't be angry

don't be sad

Don't sit cryin' 

for good times you had

There's a girl right next to you

and she's waiting 

for something to do
[Chorus:]

Do it

do it

do it

Turn your heartache into joy

She's a girl and your a boy

get together, make it tonight,

you ain't gonna need no more advice
[Chorus:]

Just love the one your with

// Killing Me Softly //

Strumming my pain with his fingers,

Singing my life with his words,

Killing me softly with his song,

Killing me softly with his song,

Telling my whole life with his words,

Killing me softly with his song ...


I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.

And so I came to see him to listen for a while.

And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.


Strumming my pain with his fingers,

Singing my life with his words,

Killing me softly with his song,

Killing me softly with his song,

Telling my whole life with his words,

Killing me softly with his song ...


I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,

I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.

I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on ...


Strumming my pain with his fingers,

Singing my life with his words,

Killing me softly with his song,

Killing me softly with his song,

Telling my whole life with his words,

Killing me softly with his song ...


He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair.

And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there.

But he just came to singing, singing clear and strong.


Strumming my pain with his fingers,

Singing my life with his words,

Killing me softly with his song,

Killing me softly with his song,

Telling my whole life with his words,

Killing me softly with his song ...


He was strumming, oh, he was singing my song.

Killing me softly with his song,

Killing me softly with his song,

Telling my whole life with his words,

Killing me softly with his song ...

With his song ...

// Endless Love //

My love, there's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love, you're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I (and I)
I want to share all my love with you (hey you)
No one else will do, you know it
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes, you will always be my endless love

Two hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
And forever (forever)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
And love (and love)
I'll be a fool for you
(Honey I'm sure)
I'm sure you know I don't mind
(Oh you know I don't mind, baby baby baby baby)
'Cuz baby you, you mean the world to me
Oh I know I found in you my endless love

Oh and love, I'll be that fool for you (for you baby)
I'm sure (I'm so sure)
That you know I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't mind)
And yes, you'll be the only one
'Cuz no one, no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you

My love
My love, my love
My, my, my
My endless love

// Evergreen //

Love, soft as an easy chair

Love, fresh as the morning air

One love that is shared by two

I have found with you

Like a rose under the April snow

I was always certain love would grow

Love ageless and evergreen

Seldom seen by two

So you and I will make each night a first

Everyday a beginning

Sprits rise and their dance go unrehearsed

They warm and excite us

Cause we have the brightest love

Two lights, two lights that shine as one

Morning glory and a midnight sun

Time we learned to sail above

Time the world changed the meaning of

Oh, ooh one love

Ageless and ever,

Evergreen.

// Reflections //

Through the mirror of my mind

Time after time

I see reflections of you and me


Reflections of the way life used to be

Reflections of the love you took from me


I'm all alone now

No love to shield me

Trapped in a world that's

a distorted reality.


Happiness you took from me

and left me alone

with only memories.


Through the mirror of my mind

Through these tears that I'm crying

Reflects the hurt I can't control

Cause although you're gone

I keep holding on

to the happy times

ooh when you were mine


AS I peer out through the window

of lost time

Looking over my yesteryear

And all this love I gave all in vain


(all the love) All the love I've wasted

(all those tears) All the tears that I've tasted

(ooh ,ooh) All in vain

(all in vain, till nothing remains)


Through the hollow of my tears

I see a dream that's lost

From the hurt

That you have caused


Everywhere I turn

seems like everything I see

Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put all my faith and trust

and right before my eyes my world has turned to dust


After all those nights I sat alone and wept

Just a hand full of promises and all that's left of loving you


Reflections of

the way life used to be

Reflections of

the love you took from me

in you I put all my faith and trust

right before my eyes my world was turned to dust

Reflections of...

// Hello //

I've been alone with you inside my mind.

And in my dreams I've kissed your lips

a thousand times.

I sometimes see you pass outside my door.


Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes.

I can see it in your smile.


You're all I've ever wanted, my arms are open wide.

'Cause you know just what to say.

And you know just what to do.

And I want to tell you so much,


I love you ...


I long to see the sunlight in your hair.

And tell you time and time again

how much I care.

Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow.

Hello, I've just got to let you know.


'Cause I wonder where you are,

And I wonder what you do.

Are you somewhere feeling lonely,

or is someone loving you?


Tell me how to win your heart,

For I haven't got a clue.

But let me start by saying,


I love you ...


Hello, is it me you're looking for?

'Cause I wonder where you are,

And I wonder what you do.

Are you somewhere feeling lonely

or is someone loving you?


Tell me how to win your heart,

For I haven't got a clue.

But let me start by saying ...


I love you.

// Always And Forever //

Always and forever

Each moment with you

Is just like a dream to me

That somehow came true, yeah


And I know tomorrow

Will still be the same

Cuz we got a life of love

That won't ever change and

[1] - Everyday love me your own special way

Melt all my heart away with a smile

Take time to tell me you really care

And we'll share tomorrow together

Ooh baby, I'll always love you forever


Ever, ever, ever

There'll always be sunshine

When I look at you

It's something I can't explain

Just the things that you do

If you get lonely

Call me and take

A second to give to me

That magic you make and

[Repeat 1]

[Ad lib until fade]

// Going In Circles //

I'm an ever rolling wheel

Without a destination real

And I'm an ever spinning top

Whirling around 'till I drop

[1] - Oh, but what am I to do

My mind is in a whirlpool

Give me a little hope

One small thing to cling to

[2] - You got me going in circles

Oh, around and around I go

Going in circles

Oh, around and around I go

I'm strung out over you


I'm a faceless clock

With timeless hopes that never stop

When I feel that way

You know my soul's at stake

[Repeat 1]

[Repeat 2]


I'm strung out over you( I need you baby)

Uuh, I need (I need you baby)

Call me (I need you baby)

I need baby, my baby, my baby

My baby, my baby girl

[Ad lib until fade]

// Since You've Been Gone //

Baby, baby, sweet baby

There's something that I've just got to say

Baby, baby, sweet baby

You left me hurtin' in a real cold way


Speak your name and I feel a thrill

You said I do, sure thing, and I said I will


I told you to just be true

And give me just a little time

Wait on me, baby

I want you to be all o' mine

I've just been so blue

Since you've been gone

(why'd ya do it, why'd ya have to do it)


Since you've been gone

I've been missin' you

Miss your good love

Miss your kissin' too

What a shame, why'd you do that

Why'd you tip on me?

Come home, bring your love back now

To rescue me, Uh Huh


Baby, baby, sweet baby

(sweet, sweet baby)

I didn't mean to run you away

It was pride on my lips

But not in my heart

To say the things that made you stray


And I mean

Hear me now (hear me)

I don't know what I'm gonna do (hear me)

Gotta get you back somehow (hear me now)


And all I know is if ya

Take me back

Consider me, please

If you walk in that door

I can get you off my knees

And I've just been so blue

Since you've been gone

(why'd ya do it, why'd ya have to do it)

Since you've been gone

(why'd ya do it, why'd ya have to do it)

// All The Woman I Need //

I used to cry myself to sleep at night

But that was all before she came

I thought love had to hurt to turn out right

But now you're here it's not the same

It's not the same


She builds me up

She gives me love

More love than I've ever seen

She's all I got

She's all I got in this world

And she's all the woman that I need


And in the morning when I kiss her eyes

She takes me down and rocks me slow

And in the evening when the moon is high

She holds me close and won't let go

She won't let go


She builds me up

She gives me love

More love than I've ever seen

She's all I got

She's all I got in this world

And she's all the woman that I need

// What The World Needs Now //

What the world needs now

Is love, sweet love

It's the only thing

That there's just too little of


What the world needs now

Is love, sweet love

No not just for some

But for everyone


Lord we don't need another mountain

There are mountains and hillsides

Enough to climb

There are oceans and rivers

Enough to cross

Enough to last

Till the end of time


What the world needs now

Is love, sweet love

No not just for some

But for everyone

Lord we don't need another meadow

There are cornfields and wheatfields

Enough to grow

And there are sunbeams and moonbeams

Enough to shine

So listen, Lord

If you want to know


What the world needs now

Is love, sweet love

It's the only thing

That there's just too little of


What the world needs now

Is love, sweet love

No not just for some

But for everyone


More love, uhh, more love

Everybody know that

(the world needs love)

Everybody, Everybody knows that

(this world needs love)

This world, the whole world

(the whole world needs love)

The whole world, the whole world

(more love, more lovin')

There's not enough...

// Impossible Dream //

To dream the impossible dream

To fight the unbeatable foe

To bear with unbearable sorrow

And to run where 

the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong

And to love pure and chaste from afar

To try when your arms are too weary

To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest

To follow that star

No matter how hopeless

No matter how far

To fight for the right

Without question or pause

To be willing to march, 

march into hell

For that heavenly cause

And I know

If I'll only be true

To this glorious quest

That my heart

Will lie peaceful and calm

When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be 

better for this

That one man, scorned 

and covered with scars,

Still strove with his last 

ounce of courage

To reach the unreachable, 

the unreachable,

The unreachable star

And I'll always dream

The impossible dream

Yes, and I'll reach

The unreachable star
