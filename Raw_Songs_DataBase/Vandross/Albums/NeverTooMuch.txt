I told my baby that I had to get away
And that I'd be back another day
She didn't even ask me where I had to go
She said she didn't need to know, ooh, ooh

Just said she'd miss me every minute of the time

I can't think of anything that I would ever miss
More than her sweet and tender kiss
She's got something that I just can't seem to resist
And that's why I've got to tell you this, listen here

I've heard some talk there's gonna be a hurricane
Big heavy winds and lots of rain, it's gonna carry on
And that's why I'm hopin' that it's not gon' take too long

// Don't You Know That? //

I got your love
You need to look no further
Don't you know that
Don't you know that

After my love
You'll never need another
Don't you know that
Don't you know that

I don't make no promises I can't keep
And I promised myself that I'd love you forever
How many times must I say that
For you to understand the real thing

Don't you know that I love you so
Baby, don't you know
Don't you know that
I love you so, ooh, don't you know

For anything that you say

Don't you know that
Alright, don't you know that

I really, really do, yeah
I'm really so in love with you, yeah
Don't you know that
Alright, ooh, yeah

I used to doubt every girl that I'd meet
I thought that nobody could knock me off my feet
But you are the one who made my heart's bell ring
And that's why I'm sure that this is the real thing, yeah

Don't you know that I love
Don't you know, ooh, ooh
Oh, don't you know that I love
Don't you know, oh, yeah
Don't you know that I love you so

// I've Been Working //

I don't know why the world loves a forever love affair
(I'm just a freak)
Who loves a one night thing oh yeah
(A one night all night)
And after a long day of work all I wanna do is play around
(So I'm going out)
For a little bit of love
And a whole lotta getting down
Do you believe me, you gotta believe me

[Chorus:]
I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight oh yeah
I need some love
I need some love tonight

People talk about my life and here's what they say
(It's incomplete)
It's too bad that they feel that way
(He's sho is crazy)
But I don't listen to any of them after five o'clock
Because the night is mine
And I don't wanna change anything 'cause I like what I got

[Chorus]

So don't give me a forever love affair, no don't you dare
(I like to freak)
To the one night beat, oh yeah
(Again and again, yeah yeah)
I work hard every day so I do what I wanna do
That's why I'm steppin' out (Stepping out)
To find me somebody to do what I wanna do

[Chorus and Fade]

// She's A Super Lady //

[Chorus: x2]
She's a Superlady,
She is, too much,
Wish I could make her mine,

What a superlady,
A-ha, alright,
She's so fine,

[Verse 1:]
Not long ago I was,
A sad and lonely boy,
Did not know how to get better,

Then heaven up above,
Sent me a super love,
And now I'm happy forever.

No one wants to believe,
I've got a perfect love,
They say I'm just talking crazy,

But I can prove it's true,
If you'l allow me to,
Tell you 'bout my Super Lady

[B-Section:]
She's all that I could explore,
She's more than a dream,
She's my everthing

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2:]
Whoever thought I would,
Be feeling half this good,
The world for me is new place,

I'll drink to happiness,
Because our love's the best,
The wine for me has a new taste,

I'll let my lady know,
I'll never let her go,
Forever I'm gonna hold on,

She said she feel's the same,
Don't wanna play no game,
Just wants our love to live on and on,

[B-Section 2:]
Wish I could fly to the sky,
And write out her name,

Climb to the top of the world,
And loudly exclaim,
She's my everything
(She's my everything)

(Oo-oo) I love (that superlady) [x4]

She 's much, too much,
She's got that super love
She's much, too much for my heart
[Repeat til end]

// You Stopped Loving Me //

You know
I've had a lot of things happen to me in my life
And yet

I don't spend much of my time
Feelin' sad
I don't let anything turn my sunshine to rain
I never have

Well, people have told me I'm not worth the time of day
Said I was over the hill
And it's been said that I always get in the way
But nothin' seemed to hurt me till

You stopped lovin'
You stopped lovin' me
Why'd you do that
You stopped lovin'
You stopped lovin' me
Lovin' me
And I don't want to do
Don't know what I'm gonna do, my love

(You stopped)
(You stopped)
(You stopped)
I just can't get it together since

(You stopped)
(You stopped)
(You stopped)
Oh

Out of your love, my love came
You made me strong
Well, it's just a shame, I don't know who or what to blame
Now that you're gone

I walk down the avenue right where I first met you
That nothin' else could do, yeah, yeah
Not a place I go through that I don't run into
Somethin' to remind me that

You stopped lovin'
You stopped lovin' me
Why'd you do that
You stopped lovin', oh
You stopped lovin' me
Lovin' me
And I don't want to do
Don't know what I'm gonna do, my love

(You stopped)
(You stopped)
(You stopped)
I just can't get it together since

(You stopped)
(You stopped)
(You stopped)
No, I just can't get it together since

(You stopped)
(You stopped)
(You stopped)
I just can't get it together since, no

(You stopped)
(You stopped)
(You stopped)
Ooh...oh...ho...

You stopped lovin', whoa, whoa
You stopped lovin' me, whoa, whoa, whoa
You stopped lovin', whoa, whoa
You stopped lovin' me, whoa, whoa, whoa

(You stopped lovin') I wonder why, wonder why, baby
(You stopped lovin' me) Why'd you do it, why'd you do that
(You stopped lovin') I wonder why, wonder why, baby
(You stopped lovin' me) Why'd you do it, girl, girl, yeah

(You stopped lovin') Why'd you do that, girl
(You stopped lovin' me) I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
(You stopped lovin') Why'd you do that, baby
(You stopped lovin' me) You stopped, you stopped, you stopped

(You stopped lovin') You don't no more, you surely stopped, girl
(You stopped lovin' me) Oh...oh...yes, you did
(You stopped lovin') If you don't anymore, you've surely stopped, girl
(You stopped lovin' me)

(You stopped lovin') I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
(You stopped lovin' me) Why'd you do that, why'd you do that, baby
(You stopped lovin')
(You stopped lovin' me)

(You stopped lovin')
(You stopped lovin' me)
