Album: TheNightIFellInLove

// The Night I Fell In Love //

[Spoken:]
I keep going over it and over it again in my mind
I get these flashback and I feel sooooo good
This is one night that I'll never forget
You see, it was just like in the movies
I mean, it actually happened just like this...

The stars were shining brighter than most of the time
Then love came out of nowhere

[Chorus:]
No thrill will ever be like
(The night that I fell in love)
I tenderly remember
(The night that I fell in love)
It surely was the best thing I ever did that night
(The night when I fell in love)

The stars' lights were in your eyes
(The night that I fell in love) with you

I've known so many people, been to most parts of the world
And seen some things that have blown my mind
But...

[Chorus]

I thought I would be happy without any love in my world
But now I know that, that is so untrue

[Chorus]

[Fade]

// It's Over Now //

[Voice:] Get out!

It's over now

Something's going on
It's the middle of the night
And my ESP woke me up
I know what's going on girl
You ain't been treating me right
And your sweet talking ain't enough
I know you're messing
With at least 2 other guys
You fooled me a long time
But the kid is getting wise
Yes I am

Don't hug me
Don't kiss me
Don't love me down
Excuse me, but you see
This love affair is over now

You did me bad
(Over now)
It's over now
You treated me so bad
(Over now)
It's all over baby

I didn't know it when I walked into the house
But you were on the telephone
That's when I heard you tell him
To come over tonight
Said you were gonna be alone
I heard you mention
That I had someplace to go
And you helped me pack my things
But it's you who's got to go
Yes it is

You're busted
You must have fooled me for a while
But honey, as they say
Hit the road
It's all over now
You did me bad
(Over now)
It's over now
You treated me so bad
(Over now)
It's all over baby

You can go now
Keep your voice down
There's no need to fuss and shout
Use the backdoor
I don't want no nosy neighbors to see you
Check it out

[Voice:] Get out

(It's all over baby)

Bye baby (bye baby)
So long (so long)
It's been a while
If you really love me
I wouldn't say it's over now
But you did me bad
(Over now)
It's over now
Well, well
You treated me so bad
(Over now)
It's all over baby
Over now
Over baby
It's surely over now
(Over now)
It's all over baby
It's over now
It's all over baby
It's all over now
(Over now)
It's all over baby
(It's all over baby)

It's over now

// Wait For Love //

Knowing love the way I do
I can say for certain that it's true
There's a chance for me and you.
I surely feel like the time is near
The picture in my mind is very clear
I think love has brought us here

I remember not too long ago
I was just a lonely person
With a lonely heart, yeah
And I was hoping there could one day be,
Be a chance

[Chorus:]
For me to get the love
That I'd been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
Wait for love
And you're gonna to get the chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love oh, my

When you take the chance on love you'll see
It's not a waste of time if you truly believe
The impossible can be
So hold on tight if you think you're right
Cause nothing hurts as bad as when you see
You gave up too easily

Now I remember spending all my time
On a dream that kept me wishing that you could be mine, yeah
And I was hoping there could one day be, be a chance, whoa

[Chorus]

I never stopped believing there could one day be, be a chance

For me to get the love that I'd been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
Wait for love, and you're going to get your
Chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love
And you'll get the love that you've been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
But wait for love
And you're going to get your chance to love
[Repeat until fade]

// My Sensitivity (Gets In The Way) //

At times I don't believe that I can't control my heart
It skips a beat even before the Lovin' starts
I seem to fall in love
With just the slighest touch
And even the little things
Begin to mean so much
And though I should hold out longer
Just to make sure things get stronger

[Chorus:]
You tell me that you love me
And before I'm sure you really do
You say you love me more and more each day
And that's when my sensitivity gets in the way

It's hard for me to play those fancy games of love
Just say the right thing baby and it's automatic love
I try not to let you know
How easily I go
Off into lovers' land
Just when you touch my hand
And though I should wait to see
How things are gonna really be

[Chorus]

// Other Side Of The World //

[Chorus 1:]
I had known you for quite some time
But the thought of love never crossed my mind
It seemed to be on the other side of the world

Too many times had I loved
And not cared at all about love
Just to have something to do
Then I saw a different you
And Ooh my

There's so many stories of love
All with the wonders of love
And so very sad I would be
'Cause none belonged to me

Could be it's all for the best
So I finally let it rest
Sad but I thought that maybe
Love wasn't meant for me

There was love love love on the other side of the world
So much love, so much love, so much love
Side of the world

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Ain't it crazy how things can change your life
Now that love is you, everything is right
And lonliness is the other side of the world

[Fade]
