There'll be lots of good days ahead for us, yeah
To each other we'll never be unjust, hmm-mmm, yeah

You captured my heart so swiftly
I gave it to you gladly
Maybe I've been seeing changes
You don't want me to be your man

// If I Had The World //

Oh yeah, now, now
If I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl
If I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl

You're like an angel to me
You always give your sympathy
When I'm exhausted, feeling low
I always know just where to go

You touch my hand, you always understand
The little things that hurt me inside
Father, I thank thee for sending me this ebony guy
When I be in misery, girl, it's just you that I see

Oh yeah, now
You drive away the pains from me
Sometimes you're like a broken baby

If I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl
If I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl
I'd give it to you, girl, oh yeah, yeah

Oh yeah, now
When I be in misery, girl, it's just you that I see
You drive away the pains from me
Sometimes you're like a broken baby

Yeah, if I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl
Yeah, if I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl
Girl, if I only had the world, I'd give it to you

// The Cheater //

By the look on your face, girl, you're my enemy
By the look on your face, girl, you're my enemy, yeah

Remember that Friday night
When you stole my pants off the line
So please tell me how you wanna make love to me

Whoa, girl
By the look in your eyes, girl, you're a cheater
By the look in your eyes, girl, you're a cheater

Going around and stealing people's clothing every day
Oh, please tell me, do you wanna be a cheater?
Whoa oh girl, oh girl, whoa girl

Going around and stealing people's clothing every day
Oh, please tell me, do you wanna be a cheater?
Whoa, girl, whoa
