// Out Of The Funk //

Out of the funk
We got a brand new sound
Out of the groove
Birth of a brand new sound

Out of the funk
We got a brand new sound
What you want to do
What you want to say about the funk

Tell me how you feel about the deal
Is it real?
You got the funk
This is not a dream
This is for real
Go ahead and scream
We got the funk

Out of the funk
Birth of a brand new sound

Tell me how you feel about the deal
Is it real?
You got the funk
This is not a dream
This is for real
Go ahead and scream
We got the funk

Out of the funk
We got a brand new groove
Out of the groove
Birth of a brand new groove

Tell me how you feel about the deal
Is it real?
You got the funk
This is not a dream
This is for real
Go ahead and scream
You got the funk

Tell me how you feel about the deal
Is it real?
You got the funk
This is not a dream
This is for real
Go ahead and scream
You got the funk

You got the funk
This is for real
On the deal
You got the funk
You got the funk
You got the funk
You got the funk

// Save A Little Love For Me //

Oh, whoa, yeah

You may say I'm dreaming
I know I'm dreaming
I got to take things in my own stride
And ride with the tide

What I want is to be with you, girl
To live in your world
For this passion I feel
Is real

Save a little love for me
That's all I will need
Save a little love for me
Whoa, yeah

Save a little love for me
That's all I will need
Save a little love for me
Whoa yeah

I might [?]
I leave a beer cold
When your love's strong
And calling for more

Gotta find me a way
In your love I'll stay
For this loneliness I must confess
Girl, it's too much for me to bear

Save a little love for me
That's all I will need
Save a little love for me
Whoa, yeah

Save a little love for me
That's all I will need
Save a little love for me
Oh, right

Ooh yeah, oh, whoa, yeah
Lead me to your world

As you may say I'm dreaming
I know I'm dreaming
I got to take things in my own stride
And ride with the tide

What I want is to be with you, girl
To live in your world
For this passion I feel
It's real

Save a little love for me
That's all I need
Save a little love for me
Whoa, yeah

Save a little love for me
That's all I need
Save a little love for me

Save a little love for me
Why don't you save it, all I need
Save a little love for me
Why don't you save it, save it

Save a little love for me, all I need
Save a little love for me
Save a little love for me
Why don't you save it, all I need

Save a little love for me
Why don't you save it, save it
Save a little love for me

// Wonders Of The World //

Wonders of the world never cease to be
Jah creates them all; Jah tells it so
Birds got to fly; babies got to cry
Fish got to swim
And I've got my song to sing

Rivers got to flow; winds got to blow
We all got to know Jah made it so
Wonders of the world never cease to be
Jah creates them all

Wonders of the world never cease to be
Jah creates them all; Jah tells it so
Birds got to fly; babies got to cry
Fish got to swim
And I've got my song to sing

Rivers got to flow; winds got to blow
We all got to know Jah made it so
I got my song to sing
Wonders of the world never cease to be
Jah creates them all; Jah tells it so
I want the world to know

Birds got to fly; babies got to cry
Fish got to swim
Rivers got to flow; the winds got to blow
We all got to know Jah made it so

// Storms Are Raging //

Storms, storms are raging
And life, good life is disappearing
The dragon has come
His work has begun
So beware, children, beware
'Cause storms are raging

Storms, storms are raging
Love, sweet love has waxed cold
The beast will deceive you with gold
Beware, children, beware

'Cause storms are raging
'Cause storms are raging
'Cause storms are raging
'Cause storms are raging

Storms are raging
Storms are raging
The time that is set is coming
The people you meet upon you
Will gnash you with their teeth

Storms, storms are raging
Sweet life, good life is disappearing
Jah Rastafari is coming
Through famine and strife
They will seek out your life

Storms, storms are raging
Storms, storms are raging
