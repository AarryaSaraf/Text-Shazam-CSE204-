// It's Magic //

Oh Lord, it's magic
Yes, it's magic
Oh, it's magic, see?

Love is never to say you're sorry
You're gonna be my baby, yeah
Love is never to say you're sorry
Yet what is to be must be, yeah

I've been watching you a mighty long time
Hoping that you'll be mine, yeah
Wearing them fancy dress, you sure look tougher than the rest
So in your nest I want to rest (Lord have mercy)

Love is never to say you're sorry
You're gonna be my baby, yeah
Love is never to say you're sorry
Yet what is to be must be, yeah

To me your love is the best, you get away to kiss and caress
That's why you're better than the rest
I like the things you do, they sure gonna put you through
You turn my grey skies into blue (Lord have mercy)

Love is never to say you're sorry
You're gonna be my baby, yeah
Love is never to say you're sorry
What is to be must-a be, yeah

Yeah, said it's magic
Loving me, yeah, magic
Woah-oh, it's magic, yeah, it's magic
Woah, it's magic, loving me, see?

I've been watching you a mighty long time now
Hoping that you'll be mine, yeah
Wearing them fancy dress, you sure look tougher than the rest
So in your nest I really wanna rest, really wanna rest
Magic, oh-oh, it's magic, see?

Love is never to say, you're sorry
You're gonna be my baby (Lord have mercy)

// The Promise Land //

Yes
The promise land
Going to the promise land
Yes the promise land
Oh gosh now, through the promise land

Imagine Ghana like California with Sunset Boulevard
Johannesburg would be Miami
Somalia like New York
With the most pretty light
The nuffest pretty car
Ever New Year the African Times Square lock-off
Imagine Lagos like Las Vegas
The ballers dem a ball
Angola like Atlanta
A pure plane take off
Bush Gardens inna Mali
Chicago inna Chad
Magic Kingdom inna Egypt
Philadelphia in Sudan
The Congo like Colorado
Fort Knox inna Gabon
People living in Morocco like the state of Oregon
Algeria warmer than Arizona bring your sun lotion
Early morning class of Yoga on the beach in Senegal
Ethiopia the capital of fi di Congression
A deh so I belong
A deh di The King come from
I can see us all in limos
Jaguars and B'mos
Riding on the King's Highway
To the promise land
Going to the promise land
Oh gosh the promise land
Yeah through the promise land

Promised Land I picture Porsche's
Basquiat Portraits
Pinky Rings realistic princesses
Heiresses bunch a Kings and Queens
Plus I picture fortunes for kids out in Port-Au-Prince
Powerless they not allowed to fit
But not about to slip
Vision Promised Land with fashion like
Madison Ave Manhattan
Saks 5th Ave and
Rodeo
Relaxing popping labels
Promise land no fables
This where the truth's told
Use them two holes
Above your nose
To see the proof yo!
Imagine a contraption that could take us back when
The world was run by black men
Back to the future
Anything can happen
If these are the last days
And hundred-foot waves come crashing down
I get some hash and pounds
Pass around the bud then watch the flood
Can't stop apocalypse
My synopsis is catastrophic
If satellites is causing earthquakes
Will we survive it
Honestly man it's the sign of the times
And the times at hand

There's a lot of work to be done, oh gosh
In the promised land

Talking 'bout promise land
Oh gosh get me to the promise land
The promise land oh the promise land
The promise land

There's plenty of land for you and I
By and by
Lost of food, to share for everyone
Cause that was civilization in the promise land
Answer to the promise land
The promise land
Going to the promise land
There's a lot of work to be done
In the promise land
