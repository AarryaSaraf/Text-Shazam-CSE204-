// Jah Can Do It //

Jah can do it
Chant down the walls of Babylon
Jah can do it
Chant down the walls of Babylon

Have you read about in the days of slavery
When some of our brothers' lives goes away
They died each and every step of the way, yeah
And when they said they needed rest
They would push a sword through them
A so it go, but Jah help us survive

So Jah can do it
Chant down the walls of Babylon
Jah can do it, Jah can do it
Chant down the walls of Babylon

Chant them down to the ground
Whoa, Jah, Jah, yeah

Could you imagine on their journey
From Africa to Jamaica
Some went overboard alive
And some of them survived
Because Jah is with I and I and I
And He'll forever be with I and I and I

So Jah can do it
Chant down the walls of Babylon
Jah can do it
Chant down the walls of Babylon

Jah can do it
Jah can do it
Jah can break it down to the ground, yeah

Jah Jah can do it
Chant down the walls of Babylon, whoa
Jah knows, he can do it, whoa
Jah Jah can do it
Chant down the walls of Babylon, whoa

// Should I //

Should I have faith in you?
Should I put my trust in you?
And should you let me down?
Should I flirt around...

Why should I think this way?
Thinking that you're going away
There ain't no way, we'll stay
Together anymore

Am I to go on now? Living this way
Acting like a child, so young and gay
You don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!

I've got to tell you this
You're love I've tried to resist
For I just can't go on like this
Pretending each day
You make me feel so mad
You make me feel so sad
Whenever I'm to share your love

So how could I ever go on? Living this way
Acting like a child, so young and gay
You don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!

I won't come down on you
With lightning brimstone or fire
For in my heart, that isn't what I require

My desire is, for you to be true and strong
And then someday you will get to know
Where you went wrong

How could I ever go on? Living this way
Acting like a child, so young and gay
You don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!

No, you don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!

// Sea Of Love //

Come with me, my love
To the sea, to the sea of love
I wanna tell you how much I love you

Do you remember the times we met
That's a day I knew I won't forget
I wanna tell you how much I love you
Come with me to the sea of love

Do you remember the times we met
That's a day I knew I won't forget
I wanna tell you how much I love you

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you
Come with me to the sea of love

Do you remember the times we met
That's a day I knew I won't forget
I wanna tell you how much I love you

I love you, I love you
Baby I love you, I love you
You turn me on, yeah turn me on
Girl, sure I love you, I love you

I love you, I love you
No one else will do, only you, yeah
I love you, I love you
Said I love, love, love, love you
Said I love you
