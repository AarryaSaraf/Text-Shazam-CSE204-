// Going To A Ball //

Just remember, we're going to a ball
Down at the beautiful hall
We're going to have fun, my dear
So, don't you get upset (Upset, upset)

Just remember, we're going to a ball
Down at the beautiful hall
We're going to have fun, my dear
So, don't you get upset

I've been waitin' to hear you say
You love-love-love me, my dear
I've been waitin' to hear you say
You'll be mine (All the time)

Just remember, we're going to a ball
Down at the beautiful hall
We're going to have fun, my dear

You'll be mine (All the time)

// I Love You Madly //

Uh-uh, let me tell you, baby

There is something about you I simply adore
This is what keeps us together
That makes my love for you grow (Wo-ho-ho!)
I found more joy; in you, my darling
That I could never find in any other girl
And I want to trade it (Oh, no!)
For nothing in this world, baby (Baby-baby, I love you madly)

'Cause, I could never let you go
I love you madly

If you should ever choose another
It will shallow all my dreams
But I love you so much more, my darling
More like water from the flowing stream (Eh-eh)
If you should ever leave me
It will surely-surely-surely kill me
And I wouldn't want to live
Without the love you give

'Cause, I need you baby (Baby-baby, I love you madly)
I love you, I love you madly (Baby-baby, I love you madly)

They say that love comes an' goes
Just like a morning sun (Oh-oh)
But I love you so much more, my darling
That anybody could ever love anyone
Baby-baby, come closer (Closer)
Just a little bit closer (Closer)
And let me whisper in your ear

Darling, I love you more than I do yesterday
But not as half as I will tomorrow

I found more joy; in you, my darling
That I could never find in any other girl
And I want to trade it (Oh, no!)
For nothing in this world, baby (Baby-baby, I love you madly)
I love you, I love you madly (Baby-baby, I love you madly)

// Rain Drops Keep Falling //

Raindrops keep falling on my head
And just like a guy whose feet are too
Big for his bed, nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head (They keep falling)

So, I just need me some talking to the sun
And I'll say that didn't like the way
He got things done, sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my head (They keep falling)

And there's one thing I know
The blues' day set to leave me
Won't defeat me, it won't be long 'till
Happiness steps up to greet me (Baby!)

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cries are for me ('Cause)
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free (Yeah)
Without things worrying me (Oh yeah)

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cries are for me ('Cause)
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free (Yeah)
Nothing's worrying me (Oh yeah)

// I Have Got To Go //

I, I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear
I, I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear

She left me without a [?]
She even broke my heart
And now she left me to cry
She left me without a [?]
She even broke my heart
And now she left me to cry

I, I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear
I, I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear

I; I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear
I; I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear

She left me without a [?]
She even broke my heart
And now she left me to cry
She left me without a [?]
She even broke my heart
And now she left me to cry

I, I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear (Wo-ho!)

// I'll Never Fall In Love //

I'll never fall in love if
It's all over now
It takes a heart to know the end

I try to take the chances
Just to feel the flowing of the [?] and love
And I left my foolish heart
Become enchanted by starlight above

I pretend I never attend her loving word from you
And it seems like you forgotten
Every joy that we once knew
Please help me understand
The way the angels claimed our love affair should end

I'll never fall in love, I'll never fall in love again

I pretend I never attend her loving word from you
And it seems like you forgotten
Every joy that we once knew (Wo-ho!)
Help me understand
The way the angels claimed our love affair should end

I'll never fall in love, I'll never fall in love again

I pretend I never attend her loving word from you
And it seems like you forgotten
Every joy that we once knew
Please help me understand
The way the angels claimed our love affair should end

I'll never fall in love, I'll never fall in love again

I pretend I never attend her loving word from you
And it seems like you forgotten
Every joy that we once knew (Wo-ho-ho!)
Please help me understand
The way the angels claimed our love affair should end

I'll never fall in love, I'll never fall in love again

I'll never fall in love again

// Make It Easy On Yourself //

Fighting your brothers everyday
Doesn't make no sense at all
Walk down the road, you see an innocent man
You rob, an' stab, an' shoot him down
Then when you think it's peace and safety
It's sudden destruction
The law seek and find your trick
And they will gut you down too

My brethren; make it easy on yourself
By doing; something that's constructive (Uh yes)
My brethren; walk a mile in my shoes
An' then you'll be far; far from around (Uh yeah)

My brethren; make it easy on yourself (Yes)
By doing; something that's constructive (Uh yes; yes)
My brethren; walk a mile in my shoes
An' then you'll be far; far from around (Uh yes)

An' then you'll be far; far from around
Then you'll be far; far from around

// I Need Someone //

I feel like dancing, but there's no one around
The music playing, but I can't hear a sound
My baby has left me an' gone away
I hope an' pray she'll be back someday

I feel like crying, 'cause I'm so all alone
I need someone to call my own
My own girl (Yes, girl!)

Oh, mother nature; or father time
I want a girl to be mine-oh-mine
Someone who's honest, an' someone who's [?]
Someone to give me piece of mind
Yes, girl; I need you, girl, yeah

I feel like dancing, but there's no one around
The music playing, but I can't hear a sound
My baby has left me an' gone away

Oh, mother nature; or father time
I want a girl to be mine-oh-mine
Someone who's honest, an' someone who's [?]
Someone to give me piece of mind
Yes, girl; I need you, girl, yeah

I feel like dancing, but there's no one around
The music playing, but I can't hear a sound
My baby has left me an' gone away
I hope an' pray she'll be back someday

Oh, yeah; alright
I wanna hold you (Yes, I just, I just)

// Something Bugging Me //

Girl, something's been bugging me
Ever since, ever since you left me alone
At nights, I can tell, dreaming about the way we used to be
Oh, girl, why don't you bring back your love to me?

You once said, that you'll love me always
And you never, you never break my heart (Oh baby!)
But, now you're gone, and I'm so lonely, and so blue
Oh, girl; why don't you come back, come back home to me?

Oh baby; I'm asking, so tell me, why we had to part?
You know when you left me, when you left
You broke my poor heart (Oh baby!)
Want to come back and stay
Baby, I'll have sent you any way
Just as long as you bring back that same old love to me

// God Bless The Children //

God; bless the children
God; bless the children

'Cause they can't stop what men do
And that's why, Lord, I calling you
They don't even know, know how to sing
And these are troubled times we're living in (Listen)
When women falls, children cries
And dearest Lord, some will die (That's why I've got to sing)
God, God, God, God, God, God (Good God)

God; bless the children (Have mercy!)
God; bless the children

Teach us how to love like never before
An' may we never-never-never study war no more
Talk to the hearts of a million believers
An' make them understand (Right now, Lord)
Children need us
I know, oh yes, I know, it's not right
But I mean it, I mean it
If they start that fight in the night, ya
God, God, God, God, God

God; bless the children
God; bless the children

So many times I have heard this phrase
"That trouble, it will last always"
Now, I'm not saying that this phrase is wrong
But, I'm wondering right now how we've last so long
You see a newborn baby in some crying mother's arm
And when you think of all the countries
That have begun, just now to say
God, God, God, God, God
