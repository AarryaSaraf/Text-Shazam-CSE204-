// Angel In Disguise //

How do you feel
Knowing you're like a meal deal, eh
Your lips are surreal
As if of cherrylade, oh-oh-oh
Your words are softly spoken, yeah-yes
And you seem to be a very nice person, yeah

With nature that can never go cold
My happiness lies in you
With everything that is blind so true

Angel in disguise, you're my
Angel in disguise, yes, yeah

What are your fancies?
Are they far reaching?
Or even moreso appealing, yeah
Tell me something
Could you be coming? Yeah

// Dock Of The Bay //

Well, well, well, yeah - oooh

Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' till the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in, yea!
Then I watch 'em roll away again, Lord

I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time

I left my home in Jamaica
Headed for London town
I have nothing to live for
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way

Lord, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time

Looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same, woo
I can't do what some people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, Lord!

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yea
Three thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this London my home

Lord, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Just to make this London my home, Lord
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time

// Don't Expect Me To Be Your Friend //

Woah, sweet lady
Uh-uh-uh

I stopped sending flowers to your apartment
You said you weren't at home much anymore
I stopped dropping by without an appointment
But I heard laughter coming through your door
Sometimes late at nights, you'll still call me
Just before you close your eyes to sleep (Yeah)
You make me a vow to try and stop by sometimes
But baby, that's a promise I can't keep

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, let's just leave the story at an end (Yeah)
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, don't expect of me to be your friend

Woah, sweet lady
Oh, why

You always act so happy when I see you
You smile that way, you take my hand and then
Introduce me to your latest lover
That's when I feel the wall starts crashing in

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, let's just leave the story at an end (Yeah)
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, don't expect of me to be your friend

Woah, sweet lady
Uh-uh-uh
I love-love-love you too much (Yeah)

// Equal Rights //

Every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be

Treat him right, Lord, and oh, treat him good
Take a tip from me, don't hang him on a tree
We should never give against another man

'Cause every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be

Remember how we're all one flesh and blood
Keep your brother up, don't push him in the mud
We should never give against another man (No, no-no)

Every man has an equal right to live and be free

'Cause every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be

Remember how we're all one flesh and blood
Lift your brother up, don't push him in the mud
We should never give against another man (No)

'Cause every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be

// I Hope We Get To Love In Time //

I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
Before I lose you; I couldn't stand the pain

The road to love has tragedies
Some loves don't get to be
Laying the tears in someone's eyes, I won't cry
And it could happen to us if we're not strong
So why don't we hurry to love before it's gone

I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
Before I lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
I hope you'll fall in love with me
'Cause it would be a tragedy
If I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain

The gates are open, we're so close
Love is almost ours to hold
A few more steps and we'll be there, if you care
We'll make it together, it's easier that way
With two falling deeper love will soon be ours to stay

I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
If I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
I hope you'll fall in love with me
'Cause it would be a tragedy
If I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain

I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
If I should lose you

// Last Thing On My Mind //

It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning
It's in your hands, in your hands

Are you going away with no words of farewell?
Could there be no trace left behind?
Well, I should have loved you better and didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand

Are you going away with no words of farewell?
Could there be no trace left behind?
Well, I should have loved you better and didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

Are you going away with no words of farewell?
Could there be no trace left behind?
Well, I should have loved you better and didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

You know that was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

That was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
That was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

// Little Green Apples //

And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says "hi"
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school... goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand
And squeezes it and says "How ya feelin', hon?"
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun

And if that's not lovin' me, then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And there's no such thing as Mother Seuss
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
Jah didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin'
And she hurries down to meet me and I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently
And smiles when she first sees me
'Cause she's made that way

And if that's not lovin' me, then all I've got to say
Jah didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the wintertime
And there's no such thing as Mother Seuss
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
Jah didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the wintertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

// Message To Martha //

Spread your wings, yea..

Spread your wings for New Orleans;
Kentucky bluebird, fly away
And take a message to Martha, message to Martha
She sings tonight in some cafe
In her search to find wealth and fame
I hear Martha has gone and changed her name, yea

It's a year since she was here;
Kentucky bluebird, fly away

And take a message to Martha, message to Martha
Tell her I miss her more each day
As her train pulled out, down the track
Martha promised she'll soon be coming back

Wooh tell her how my heart just breaks, in two
Since she journeyed far..
And even though her dreams of fame fell through
To me she will always be a star

It's a year since she was here, woo;
Kentucky bluebird, fly away

And take a message to Martha, message to Martha
Tell her I miss her more each day
As her train pulled out, down the track
Martha promised she'll soon be coming back, woo, yea!

Wooh, fly away, Kentucky bluebird;
Fly away, Kentucky bluebird;
Fly away, fly away, fly away, fly away..

// Spanish Harlem //

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one
It's never seen the sun
It only comes up when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street
Right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal
That looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon
I'm goin' to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In my garden

I'm goin' to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In my garden

La la la...

My beautiful rose

You and your smiling face
Doesn't mean a thing, to me
Any man will pick you up
Just because of that smile you've got

But after knowing you as much as I
He's gonna leave you.. just like I did

Did excite me so much, that I had a feeling
I never had before

But after knowing you I had to run
Because it's only a smile you've got
