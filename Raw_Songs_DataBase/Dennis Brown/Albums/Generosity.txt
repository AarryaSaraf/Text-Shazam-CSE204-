// I Believe //

Owee girl child, yeah
Said you're a awesome, oh girl

I believe in miracles and I believe in you too
I believe in the things you say
Oh girl, come what may

I believe you and I should fall in love
I believe it's blessing up above
I believe you and I could make things really happen
For both of us forever and always, ooh

You and I ought to be example, yes
Too many girls and boys, yes
Falling out of love doesn't make no sense at all
Come let's get it on, on and on and on

I believe you and I should fall in love
I believe it's blessing up above
I believe you and I could make things really happen
For both of us forever and always, ooh

Woe, oh, naa
Said you're awesome girl, awesome you are
I believe in miracles and I believe in you too
I believe in the things you say, yes
Oh girl, come what may

You always say the right things I wanna hear, yes
I wanna hear with my ear
You know just how to make a man feel like living, girl
Oh girl, said you're awesome, you are

I believe you and I should fall in love
I believe it's blessing up above
I believe you and I could make things really happen
For both of us forever and always, ooh

I believe, I believe, I believe, really, really
Yes, I believe in you
I believe in the things you say and do
Oh yes, I do, awesome, awesome you are

I believe you and I should fall in love
I believe it's blessing up above
I believe you and I could make things really happen
For both of us forever and always, ooh
