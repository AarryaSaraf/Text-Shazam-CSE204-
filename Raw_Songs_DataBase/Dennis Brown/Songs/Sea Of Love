Come with me, my love
To the sea, to the sea of love
I wanna tell you how much I love you

Do you remember the times we met
That's a day I knew I won't forget
I wanna tell you how much I love you
Come with me to the sea of love

Do you remember the times we met
That's a day I knew I won't forget
I wanna tell you how much I love you

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you
Come with me to the sea of love

Do you remember the times we met
That's a day I knew I won't forget
I wanna tell you how much I love you

I love you, I love you
Baby I love you, I love you
You turn me on, yeah turn me on
Girl, sure I love you, I love you

I love you, I love you
No one else will do, only you, yeah
I love you, I love you
Said I love, love, love, love you
Said I love you
