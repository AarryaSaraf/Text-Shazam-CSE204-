You think  in a conversation
And you sure to be an illiterate boy
'Cause you could not spell your name

Although your mind is deserted
You replied this is bad
You're no good for me
Though I accept your apology

I keep telling you
That discipline yourself
And you say that's nonsense
So I won't say anything at all

But remember wherever you go
You're not to speak aloud in a crowd
'Cause you might be ashamed of yourself

'Cause I keep telling you
That disciple yourself
And you say that's nonsense
So I won't say anything at all

You're just standing different
You're not the type I run to

I keep telling you
To discipline yourself
My brother
And you people say
