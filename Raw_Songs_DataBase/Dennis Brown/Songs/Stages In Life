Uh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah

The stages in life, it's for a man to see and know
There are a lot of things that could hurt a man
Like taking away his daily bread
I know how he feels when a man's heart is broken (Woah-oh)
As a man we've got to stand these blows
Take life serious 'cause it ain't no joke
There's a change on to be feared
And not by ever instead, no (No)
We all have our own responsibility
And we forgot to live a life and be free
Oh, it hurts so bad when there's no one to give pleasure
We've got to help ourselves day by day
And we'll be helped in some other way (Oh yeah)

The stages in life, it's for a man to see and know (Yeah)
There are a lot of things that could hurt a man
Like taking away his daily bread
There's a change on to be feared
And not by ever instead
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
