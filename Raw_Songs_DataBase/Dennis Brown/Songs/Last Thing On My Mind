It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning
It's in your hands, in your hands

Are you going away with no words of farewell?
Could there be no trace left behind?
Well, I should have loved you better and didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand

Are you going away with no words of farewell?
Could there be no trace left behind?
Well, I should have loved you better and didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

Are you going away with no words of farewell?
Could there be no trace left behind?
Well, I should have loved you better and didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

You know that was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

That was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
That was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
