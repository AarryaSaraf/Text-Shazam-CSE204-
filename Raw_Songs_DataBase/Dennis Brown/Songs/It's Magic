Oh Lord, it's magic
Yes, it's magic
Oh, it's magic, see?

Love is never to say you're sorry
You're gonna be my baby, yeah
Love is never to say you're sorry
Yet what is to be must be, yeah

I've been watching you a mighty long time
Hoping that you'll be mine, yeah
Wearing them fancy dress, you sure look tougher than the rest
So in your nest I want to rest (Lord have mercy)

Love is never to say you're sorry
You're gonna be my baby, yeah
Love is never to say you're sorry
Yet what is to be must be, yeah

To me your love is the best, you get away to kiss and caress
That's why you're better than the rest
I like the things you do, they sure gonna put you through
You turn my grey skies into blue (Lord have mercy)

Love is never to say you're sorry
You're gonna be my baby, yeah
Love is never to say you're sorry
What is to be must-a be, yeah

Yeah, said it's magic
Loving me, yeah, magic
Woah-oh, it's magic, yeah, it's magic
Woah, it's magic, loving me, see?

I've been watching you a mighty long time now
Hoping that you'll be mine, yeah
Wearing them fancy dress, you sure look tougher than the rest
So in your nest I really wanna rest, really wanna rest
Magic, oh-oh, it's magic, see?

Love is never to say, you're sorry
You're gonna be my baby (Lord have mercy)
