Girl, something's been bugging me
Ever since, ever since you left me alone
At nights, I can tell, dreaming about the way we used to be
Oh, girl, why don't you bring back your love to me?

You once said, that you'll love me always
And you never, you never break my heart (Oh baby!)
But, now you're gone, and I'm so lonely, and so blue
Oh, girl; why don't you come back, come back home to me?

Oh baby; I'm asking, so tell me, why we had to part?
You know when you left me, when you left
You broke my poor heart (Oh baby!)
Want to come back and stay
Baby, I'll have sent you any way
Just as long as you bring back that same old love to me
