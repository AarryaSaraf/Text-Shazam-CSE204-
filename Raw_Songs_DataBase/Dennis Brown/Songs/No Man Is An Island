No man is an island
No man stands alone
Each man has a brother
And remember
Each man's dream has a road

Now we need one another ooh yes
And we all try to be friends
Each man has a brother
And a each man has a friend

You can live in this world all by yourself
In this world all by yourself
No nonoooo you can't make it alone
And just as sure as you try to make it by yourself
You gonna wake up and find you gonna need somebody else

No man is an island
No man stands alone
Each man has has brother
And remember
Each man's dream has a road
