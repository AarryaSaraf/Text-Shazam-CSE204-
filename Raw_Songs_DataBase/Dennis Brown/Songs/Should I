Should I have faith in you?
Should I put my trust in you?
And should you let me down?
Should I flirt around...

Why should I think this way?
Thinking that you're going away
There ain't no way, we'll stay
Together anymore

Am I to go on now? Living this way
Acting like a child, so young and gay
You don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!

I've got to tell you this
You're love I've tried to resist
For I just can't go on like this
Pretending each day
You make me feel so mad
You make me feel so sad
Whenever I'm to share your love

So how could I ever go on? Living this way
Acting like a child, so young and gay
You don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!

I won't come down on you
With lightning brimstone or fire
For in my heart, that isn't what I require

My desire is, for you to be true and strong
And then someday you will get to know
Where you went wrong

How could I ever go on? Living this way
Acting like a child, so young and gay
You don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!

No, you don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!
