'Cause of Malcolm X, white man got vexed
They didn't want to see black man progress
And all along the way, black man have strayed
Searching to find the way, oh yeah

How long will it be
'Til you black man see
The hidden brutality?

Now Malcolm X main prospect was to see, yeah
All man live in unity
But now he is down, down in the ground
Where can the killers be found, I wanna know

How long will it be
'Til all my brothers see
The hidden brutality?

It's been hidden from our eyes much too long
It can't go on and on, no, no, no
The hidden brutality, yeah

'Cause of Malcolm X, white man got vexed
They didn't want to see black man progress
And all along the way, black man have strayed
Searching to find the way, oh yeah

How long will it be
'Til all my brothers see
The hidden brutality?

How long will it be?
It's been hidden from our eyes for too long
We got to know the truth
