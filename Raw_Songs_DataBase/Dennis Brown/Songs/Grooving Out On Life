Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I get my kicks from watching people (Ah-ah-ah)
Running to and from
But if you ask them, where they're going (Ah-ah-ah)
Half of them don't know
And they're the ones who think I'm crazy (Ah-ah-ah)
But they don't realize

That I'm just grooving (Grooving)
Uh, grooving (Grooving)
Grooving out on life
Keep on, keep on grooving (Grooving-grooving)
Grooving (Grooving)
Grooving 'till I die

See a river flowing by me (Ah-ah-ah)
Headed for the sea
I get the feeling deep inside me (Ah-ah-ah)
It's so good to be free
And I get sunshine (Sunshine)
In the daytime (Daytime)
And moonlight every night

That keeps me grooving (Grooving)
Keep me grooving, yeah (Grooving-grooving)
Grooving (Out on life)
Keep on, keep on grooving (Grooving-grooving)
Don't stop moving (Grooving)
Grooving ('Till I die)

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Everybody, keep on grooving (Grooving)
Don't stop moving (Moving-moving)
Grooving out on life
Keep on, keep on grooving (Grooving-grooving)
Grooving (Grooving)
Grooving 'till I die

Keep on moving, moving, moving, moving (Ah-ah-ah)
Till I die, ye-yeah
Uh, moving, woah, oh yeah (Ah-ah-ah)
Till I die, keep on moving
I don't stop moving y'all (Ah-ah-ah)
