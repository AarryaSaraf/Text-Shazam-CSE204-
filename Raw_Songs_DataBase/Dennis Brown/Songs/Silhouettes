Silhouette...

Took a walk and passed your house late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within the dim light cast, two silhouettes on the shade
Oh what a lovely couple they made

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...

Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste, in the night
I wondered why I'm not a man, whose silhouettes on the shade
I couldn't hide those tears in my eyes

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...

It's true... oh yeah

Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who had been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock you're on the wrong block

Ran down to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved you my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days two silhouettes on the shade

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...

Must come to your house with wings, on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved, you my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be, two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...

Silhouette...
