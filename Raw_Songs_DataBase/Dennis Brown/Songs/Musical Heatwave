Now listen to my story
And sing a long with me

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

When summer comes along
You can hear the children sing the song
When summer comes along
You can see the preacher men drinking rum

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

The breeze starts blowin'?
You can hear it rustlin? through the trees
You'll also hear the  sounds
You really, really want to sing along

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

If you're feeling sad and low
There's one thing that you should know
That even the birds
Are happy to sing along with me

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
