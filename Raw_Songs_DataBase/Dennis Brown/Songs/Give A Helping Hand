A time to mourn, a time to cry
Woah, a time to get over

Give an helping hand, oh Jah
Give an helping hand, oh Jah (Oh woah)
Give an helping hand, oh Jah
Give an helping hand, oh Jah (Oh woah)

The youths are crying everyday
The youths are crying everyday
When they call on your name to get over (Over)
To the promised land they had been in dream of
The promised land they had been in hearing of
How long must we wait on you, oh God, how long? (Get over)
Need someone to talk to both day and night
Someone will help us to fight for our rights
Why are you so far from helping us?
And a from the words of our roaring

Give an helping hand, oh Jah
Give an helping hand, oh Jah
Oh woah-oh, oh-oh-oh, yah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Move, move, move, yeah, woah


Yeah, oh-oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
To follow their footsteps and the fair you do
And try to understand of the things you do
Gather not our souls with sinners
For they eat the bread of destruction

Give an helping hand, oh Jah
Give an helping hand, oh Jah
Oh woah, woah-oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Eh, eh, eh, woah yeah 
Give an helping hand, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
