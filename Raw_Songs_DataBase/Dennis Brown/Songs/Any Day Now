Any day now
I will hear you say goodbye my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild, beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now I'll be all alone

Any day now
When your restless eyes
Meet someone new
Oh to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows will fall
All over town
Any day now, now love will let me down

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay

Any day now
When the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
And then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadows will fall
All over town
Any day now, now
Love will let me down
'Cause you won't be around
No, don't fly away
My beautiful bird
Don't, don't fly away
My beautiful bird
Well.. why oh why..
