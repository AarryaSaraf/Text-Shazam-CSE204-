Now this is my time, oh yeah
Lord have mercy
Now it's my time
It's not your time
Now is my time

There'll be no mercy for the merciless
All liars and a thieves must confess
When it's their turn to meet the almighty one
Oh what a day it is today

Today now it's my time
Sing revelation time
It's a blessed time
It's Negast's time

Although children are having children
Brothers are fighting brothers
Mother against their own sons
Fighting against their religion

This is rasta time
A blessed time
It's a very great time
It's the right time
Wooy

Now it is rasta time, oh yeah
Now it is my time
Now it is my time yeah wow

I said, there'll be no mercy for the merciless
All liars and-a thieves must confess
When it's their turn to meet the almighty one
Oh what a day it is today

Now it's my time
Singing revelation time
It's a blessed time
It's Negast time
Say it's rasta time
It's my time
Singing revelation time
A very great time
This is rasta time, whoo yeah
Sayin' this is rasta time, whoo yeah yeah
This is my time
A very great time...
