I can't believe that it's real
The way that she makes me feel
Its something deep down inside
Oh it's a feeling I just cannot hide
She's never been unfaithful to me
So we will always be
She's never been unfaithful to me
As far as I can see
She gave me love in the morning and in the evening too
She gave me love in when I'm lonely so I never felt blue
So ride on Cassandra ride on ride on ride on
Ride on Cassandra ride on ride on ride on
