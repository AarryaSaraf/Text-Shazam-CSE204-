Girl in my corner
Oh Lord, oh well

Whatever it takes to be your man
I'm gonna hold on
And take my stand
I know I like to please you girl
For having you in my world, Lord
Don't need no lullabies
Nor no silly cries
I've gotta take my stand
Little things sometimes, hurt so bad
It's like a lost love you've had, yeah
Although you've got your plan, Carrisma is class
You know I've gotta take a stand

Take a stand (Baby)
Take a stand (Gotta take my stand)
Take a stand (Oh girl)
Take a stand

Next time you pass on by
You'll see a brand new me
Next time you walk on by
You'll see a change in me
Next time you pass on by
You'll see a brand new me
Next time you walk on by
You'll see a change in need

Yeah, oh woah now
Change in me now
Real, real, real
Change

Whatever it takes to be your man
I'm gonna take a stand
Just like a soldier
Who fights for his rights
I've gotta protect my pride
Believe me girl
I know I'm not lying
Gotta believe me
I've gotta protect
Protect, my pride
Girl, gotta protect my pride, yes

Next time you walk on by
You'll see a brand new me
Next time you walk on by
You'll see a change in me
Next time you walk on by
You'll see a brand new me
Next time you pass on by
You'll see a change in me

Yeah, yeah
Next time
Next time you walk on by
Next time you walk on by

You'll see a change, yeah baby
See a change in me, woooowoah
Girl, girl in my world
Girl
Next time you pass on by
You'll see a brand new me
Next time you walk on by
