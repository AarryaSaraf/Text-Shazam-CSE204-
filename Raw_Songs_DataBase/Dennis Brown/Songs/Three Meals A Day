Free up my brothers one by one
They need to be free (Oh yeah now)

Three meals a day
No rent to pay
Got to no wife to obey
Only the bosses gettin' paid
Sitting in a two by four
Lookin' through an iron door
Down in hell
I could never get used to that smell

I'm talkin' about detention-detention
I'm talkin' about deten- (Yeah)
I'm talkin' about detention-detention
I'm talkin' about deten-

Believe me; (Oh-oh, believe me)
Believe me, (Hm-hm, it's true)
Believe me

I said, three meals a day
Got no rent to pay
Got to no wife to obey
Only the bosses gettin' paid
Sitting in a two by four
Lookin' through an iron door
Down in hell, I said
I could never get used to the smell (No)

I'm talkin' about detention-detention
I'm talkin' about deten- (Yeah)
I'm talkin' about detention-detention
I'm talkin' about deten- (Na-na-na)

Got to believe me, (oh-oh-oh, it's true)
Detention, detention (Woah yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Woah yeah)

The wrong remains the same
And the righteous gets the blame
The wrong remains the same
Jah people gets the blame
Every time, everyday, everywhere they go
Jah people-Jah people, gets the blame
Every time, everywhere they go

Got to overcome the judgement and tribulation (Oh yeah)
