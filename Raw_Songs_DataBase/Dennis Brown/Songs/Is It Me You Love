Wooowooo, baby, lady

Or are you just fooling a man like me
Man like me baby

You don't wanna be sorry
No no no nooo

As time goes by
Girl you realize, oh
Where your true love

Words make sense and see is
Sentences make phrases
So I can describe how I'm feeling about you girl
Oh baby

Still never walked out the door

No, that your loving, I'm gonna miss, well
Have you found someone new
Tell me what should I do
Baby, baby
Tell me what should I do

Is it me you're loving
Or are you just fooling...
