Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love is amazing
Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love is amazing

You made the wanderer like me
Into what I'm supposed to be
Could be sadness, right or wrong
You beat my weakness and make me strong
I'm gonna love you the whole night true
'Cause no one never does the things you do

Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing
Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing

With nothing to cling to, day and night
Nothing for me seems to go right
Darling, you stretch out your hands
An' make me a better man (Yeah)
I'm gonna love you the whole night true
'Cause no one never does the things you do

Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing (Oh-oh)
Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing

Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing (Oh-oh-oh)
Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing
