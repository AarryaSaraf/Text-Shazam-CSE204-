Stay at home, oh yeah

That little girl was born on the ghetto side of town
She knows every trick in the book and she certainly gets around
She's been with many men, since she was only ten
She never stay at home, she's always on the run

Your mama is wondering where you are
What do you see at nights when you're under the stars?
Baby, keep on running and you won't get far

Stay at home
Sister, stay at home
Don't let your mama down
Don't be a run around, no

Stay at home
Sister stay at home
Don't let your mama down
Don't be a run around

Your mama is wondering where you are
What do you see at nights when you're under the stars?
Baby, keep on running and you won't get far

You like to travel in a fast and shiny car
You travel with the crew of movie stars
Sister, stay at home, oh yeah
Don't let your mama down, no
Stay at home, oh yeah
Stay at home yeah
My baby, stay at home
