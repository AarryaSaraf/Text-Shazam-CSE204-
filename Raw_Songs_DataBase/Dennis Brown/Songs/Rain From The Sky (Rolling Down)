Said it's rolling down, rolling down my cheek, yeah
It's rolling down, rolling down my cheek, yeah

Ever since you went away
Every day, is just a cloudy day
And I don't know, if it's rain from the skies
Or tears from my eyes, falling onto my face
And rolling down my cheek

Hurry back, and bring the sun out
And let me be, your, one and only one
With just one kiss, stop the rain from the skies
Or tears from my eyes, falling onto my face
And rolling down my cheek

All I know is I love you, and if I live forever
I'll be laughing, you're still here
You will always be just, everything to me

So, hurry back, and bring the sun out
Let me be, your, one and only one
With just one kiss, stop the rain from the skies
Or tears from my eyes, falling onto my face
And rolling down my cheek

All I know is I love you, and if I live forever
I'll be laughing, you're still here
You will always be just, everything to me

So, hurry back, and bring the sun out
Let me be, your, one and only one
With just one kiss, stop the rain from the skies
Or tears from my eyes, falling onto my face
And rolling down my cheek
