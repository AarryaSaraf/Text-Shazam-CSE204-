I'll never fall in love if
It's all over now
It takes a heart to know the end

I try to take the chances
Just to feel the flowing of the  and love
And I left my foolish heart
Become enchanted by starlight above

I pretend I never attend her loving word from you
And it seems like you forgotten
Every joy that we once knew
Please help me understand
The way the angels claimed our love affair should end

I'll never fall in love, I'll never fall in love again

I pretend I never attend her loving word from you
And it seems like you forgotten
Every joy that we once knew (Wo-ho!)
Help me understand
The way the angels claimed our love affair should end

I'll never fall in love, I'll never fall in love again

I pretend I never attend her loving word from you
And it seems like you forgotten
Every joy that we once knew
Please help me understand
The way the angels claimed our love affair should end

I'll never fall in love, I'll never fall in love again

I pretend I never attend her loving word from you
And it seems like you forgotten
Every joy that we once knew (Wo-ho-ho!)
Please help me understand
The way the angels claimed our love affair should end

I'll never fall in love, I'll never fall in love again

I'll never fall in love again
