Now that the change has come
We must have some fun
Now that the change has come
We must have some fun

Watching the kids playing on the lawn
They're looking gay as the bright sun shines
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here

Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll unite and live as one

We'll stop fussing and fighting among ourselves
'Cause now we have seen the light
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here

We'll stop fussing and fighting among ourselves
'Cause now we have seen the light
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here

Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll unite and live as one

Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
