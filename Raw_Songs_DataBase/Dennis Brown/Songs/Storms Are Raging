Storms, storms are raging
And life, good life is disappearing
The dragon has come
His work has begun
So beware, children, beware
'Cause storms are raging

Storms, storms are raging
Love, sweet love has waxed cold
The beast will deceive you with gold
Beware, children, beware

'Cause storms are raging
'Cause storms are raging
'Cause storms are raging
'Cause storms are raging

Storms are raging
Storms are raging
The time that is set is coming
The people you meet upon you
Will gnash you with their teeth

Storms, storms are raging
Sweet life, good life is disappearing
Jah Rastafari is coming
Through famine and strife
They will seek out your life

Storms, storms are raging
Storms, storms are raging
