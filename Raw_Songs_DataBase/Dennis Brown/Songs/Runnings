Woah-oh, I wish you love
Yeah, yes

I said you're running and you're running around
But I wish you lots of love, yeah, yes
I said you're running and you're running around
But I wish you lots of love, yes, yes

'Cause you lied and you cheated, yes
Right from the start
But you come on standing on your bending knees
Wanting me to love you, yes

And sometimes I wonder, oh, why we have to fight, yes
And how many times I said you really broke my heart
Oh, tell me what I'm supposed to do
What do you want me to do? Yeah

In your loving, she cannot stay
In your loving, yes, yeah
In your loving, yes, yeah
In your loving, yes, yeah
In your loving, woah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, now
Ooh, yeah, now

And how many times have you
Been running and you're running around
After I told you, I told you to settle down
You were only hurting your own self, yes
Breaking your own travel dart, well
I know-know-know, yeah, yeah

Who's rushing where angels fear to go? Oh, yes
I said-a who's rushing the running and the running around?
Where angels fear to go, oh, yes
