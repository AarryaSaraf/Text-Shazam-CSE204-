God; bless the children
God; bless the children

'Cause they can't stop what men do
And that's why, Lord, I calling you
They don't even know, know how to sing
And these are troubled times we're living in (Listen)
When women falls, children cries
And dearest Lord, some will die (That's why I've got to sing)
God, God, God, God, God, God (Good God)

God; bless the children (Have mercy!)
God; bless the children

Teach us how to love like never before
An' may we never-never-never study war no more
Talk to the hearts of a million believers
An' make them understand (Right now, Lord)
Children need us
I know, oh yes, I know, it's not right
But I mean it, I mean it
If they start that fight in the night, ya
God, God, God, God, God

God; bless the children
God; bless the children

So many times I have heard this phrase
"That trouble, it will last always"
Now, I'm not saying that this phrase is wrong
But, I'm wondering right now how we've last so long
You see a newborn baby in some crying mother's arm
And when you think of all the countries
That have begun, just now to say
God, God, God, God, God
