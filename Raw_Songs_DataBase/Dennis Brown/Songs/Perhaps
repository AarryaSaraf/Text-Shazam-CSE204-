You were made to love me (And so)
How am I able to know?
You always tell me
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"
A million times I've ask you (An' then)
I ask you over again
You only answer
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't want to wind up
Being parted, broken-hearted

So, if you love me, say yes
But if you don't, dear, confess
And please don't tell me
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps" (Baby)

A million times I've ask you (An' then)
I ask you over again
You only answer
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't want to wind up
Being parted, broken-hearted

If you really love me, say yes
But if you don't, dear, confess
And please don't tell me
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps" (Yeah)

Woah-woah, yeah-yeah
That's why you can't say it to me (Woah!)
You keep on sayin', you keep on sayin', you keep on sayin'
"Perhaps" yeah
Can't take it no more, can't say it no way
I won't lose my baby, no way!
