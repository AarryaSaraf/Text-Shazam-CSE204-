Fighting your brothers everyday
Doesn't make no sense at all
Walk down the road, you see an innocent man
You rob, an' stab, an' shoot him down
Then when you think it's peace and safety
It's sudden destruction
The law seek and find your trick
And they will gut you down too

My brethren; make it easy on yourself
By doing; something that's constructive (Uh yes)
My brethren; walk a mile in my shoes
An' then you'll be far; far from around (Uh yeah)

My brethren; make it easy on yourself (Yes)
By doing; something that's constructive (Uh yes; yes)
My brethren; walk a mile in my shoes
An' then you'll be far; far from around (Uh yes)

An' then you'll be far; far from around
Then you'll be far; far from around
