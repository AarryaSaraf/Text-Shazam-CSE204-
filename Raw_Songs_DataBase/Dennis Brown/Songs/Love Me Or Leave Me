A won't you love me, hmm? Yes I do

Love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl, hmm
I want you to love me, but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl, hmm

You're my only pride and joy, hmm
And you said I was your favourite toy, Lord
You're my heaven on earth, Lord knows
But it seems you wanna diss me dirt

Love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl, hmm
I want you to love me
Love me or leave me, girl

I gave you my whole heart with ease, Lord knows
Didn't know you was so hard to please
And you don't think you'd ask me to
Now I wanna hear the truth from you, oh

Love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl, hmm
Love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl

Hmm...

Tell me, and I will understand, Lord knows
If you have found another man, Lord
I wanna know, what it's all about, yeah
So we can sit down and work it out, Lord

Love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl, hmm
I want you to love me, even to leave me
But please don't deceive me, girl

Love, love, love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Don't you, don't you - love me or leave me
I want you to love - love me or leave me
But don't deceive me - don't you, don't you, don't
Love me or leave me
