It's better when you hold me, whoa, yeah
But when you squeeze me, ah, ah
I get that feeling inside
That funny feeling inside

Gee, I wanna love you, whoa, yeah
I wanna love you, ah, ah

That feeling of passion and desire
That sets my soul on fire
Makes me wanna love you, whoa, yeah
I wanna love you, ah, ah

Try to be gentle with me
I'm not such a lover as you see
But I wanna love you, whoa, yeah
I wanna love you, ah ah

I wanna love, love, love, love
Love, love, love you baby, whoa, yeah
I wanna love, love, love, love
Love, love, love you baby, whoa, yeah

Try to be gentle with me
I'm not such a lover as you see
But I wanna love you, whoa, yeah
I wanna love you, ah, ah

I get that feeling inside
That funny feeling inside
Gee, I wanna love you, whoa, yeah
I wanna love you, ah, ah

I wanna love, love, love, love
Love, love, love you baby, whoa, yeah
I wanna love, love, love, love
Love, love, love you baby, whoa, yeah

It's better when you hold me, whoa, yeah
But when you squeeze me, ah, ah
I get that feeling inside
That funny feeling inside

Gee, I wanna love you, whoa, yeah
I wanna love you, ah, ah

I wanna love, love, love, love
Love, love, love you baby, whoa, yeah
I wanna love, love, love, love
Love, love, love you baby, whoa, yeah

Love, love
