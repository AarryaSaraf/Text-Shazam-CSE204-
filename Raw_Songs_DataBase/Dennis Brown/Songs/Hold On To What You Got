Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got

If you can excel lot of criticism
Then you'll know you're on your way
If you can excel on your journey
Then you know my heart is yearning

Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got

If you can excel on your journey
Then you know, on your way
If you can excel on your journey
Then you know my heart is really yearning

Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got

If you on the way 
Then you know how I'm feelin'
If you only wait just for a minute
Then you'll know my heart is really yearning

Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got

Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got
Hold on to what you got
