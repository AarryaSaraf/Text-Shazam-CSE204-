Girl, I've got a date (Ah-ah)
And I just mean I can't stay late (Ah-ah)
All my life I've been warning you, girl
Not just once or twice, no
Take this from-a me:
I'm as free like birds in trees (Ye-yeah)

I really mean it
Yeah-yeah

Girl, I've got a date (Ah-ah)
And I just mean, I can't stay late (Ah-ah)
Girl, I've been warning you, yeah
No-no-no, girl, you just can't be my wife, no
Take this from-a me:
I'm as free like the birds in trees (Yeah)

Woah, ye-ye-yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah, now-now (Oh yeah)
Seen

Girl, I've been warning you, yeah
No-no-no, girl, you just can't be my wife, no
Take this from-a me:
I'm as free like the birds in trees (Ye-yeah)

Oh yeah
Ye now
Girlie

Say, girl, I've got a date (Ah-ah)
And I just mean, I can't stay late (Ah-ah)
All of my life I've been warning you, girl
Not just once or twice, no
Take this from-a me:
I'm as free like the birds in trees (Ye-yeah)
