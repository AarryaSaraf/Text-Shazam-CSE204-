Lately girl I've been watching you all right
I don't know why I think of you every night
Please girl what is it that I see in you
That suits me so, yeah
I'd really like to know

I pray and I am hoping well
I'll take you by your hand
And lead you to the promised land far away

I take you to the promised land far away
Don't you know...
Little girl
