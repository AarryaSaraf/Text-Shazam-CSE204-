Well, well, well, yeah - oooh

Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' till the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in, yea!
Then I watch 'em roll away again, Lord

I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time

I left my home in Jamaica
Headed for London town
I have nothing to live for
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way

Lord, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time

Looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same, woo
I can't do what some people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, Lord!

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yea
Three thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this London my home

Lord, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Just to make this London my home, Lord
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time
