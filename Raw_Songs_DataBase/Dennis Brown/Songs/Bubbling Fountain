Curse him and die, I say (Uh yeah, yeah)

Boast not yourself, mankind
For you know not what the day may bring
They that exalted themselves this day, oh yeah
Shall surely, shall surely be abased (See)
And when your heart, your heart is broken, yes
Got to accept it as a token (Woah-oh, woah, woah)
For life can be real sweet, life is just like a fountain
Woah-oh, like a bubbling fountain (Uh yes)

But you got to love Jah to get over

For life can be real sweet, life is just like a fountain
Woah-oh, like a bubbling fountain (Uh yeah)

But you got to love Jah to get over (Uh yeah now)
