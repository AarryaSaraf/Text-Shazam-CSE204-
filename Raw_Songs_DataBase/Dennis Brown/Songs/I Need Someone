I feel like dancing, but there's no one around
The music playing, but I can't hear a sound
My baby has left me an' gone away
I hope an' pray she'll be back someday

I feel like crying, 'cause I'm so all alone
I need someone to call my own
My own girl (Yes, girl!)

Oh, mother nature; or father time
I want a girl to be mine-oh-mine
Someone who's honest, an' someone who's 
Someone to give me piece of mind
Yes, girl; I need you, girl, yeah

I feel like dancing, but there's no one around
The music playing, but I can't hear a sound
My baby has left me an' gone away

Oh, mother nature; or father time
I want a girl to be mine-oh-mine
Someone who's honest, an' someone who's 
Someone to give me piece of mind
Yes, girl; I need you, girl, yeah

I feel like dancing, but there's no one around
The music playing, but I can't hear a sound
My baby has left me an' gone away
I hope an' pray she'll be back someday

Oh, yeah; alright
I wanna hold you (Yes, I just, I just)
