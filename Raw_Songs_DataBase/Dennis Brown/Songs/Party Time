We're having a party tonight
Where everything will be alright

Come on, come on, everyone
It's time that we should have some fun
We've got to live some life, before we're old
We've got to live some life, before we're cold, yeah

Time is short, so hear me man, yeah
Let's live the life the best we can
Don't try to work your soul away
Remember there's another day

We've got to live some life, yeah, before we're old
We've got to live some life, before we're cold

Yeah, yeah - ooh-whoa, whoa, yeah
Yeah, yeah, whoa, whoa, yeah

...
Yeah-whoa - yeah, yeah

We're having a party tonight, yeah
Where everything will be alright

Come on, come on, everyone
It's time that we should have some fun
We've got to live some life, before we're old
We've got to live some life, before we're cold, yeah

Time is short, so hear me man, yeah
Let's live the life the best we can..
