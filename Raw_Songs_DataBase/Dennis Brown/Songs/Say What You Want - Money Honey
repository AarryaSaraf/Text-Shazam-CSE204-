Say what you're saying
And do what you're doing
'Cause I got something baby
Money can't buy
Yes I-I-I-I-I
Whoa yeah
I love this little girl of mine
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah

When I ain't got no money
She is still my honey
So there is no reason to be funny
'Cause I-I-I-I-I, I-I-i-I-I
Whoa yeah
I love this little girl of mine
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah
