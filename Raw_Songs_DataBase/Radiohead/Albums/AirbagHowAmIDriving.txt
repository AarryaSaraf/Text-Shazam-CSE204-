Album: AirbagHowAmIDriving

// Airbag //

In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

// Pearly //

How'd you get your
Teeth so pearly?
Dew-drop dentures
White-washed fences

She runs from the third world, pearly

Vanilla (Feel it crawl to me) milkshakes (Crawl back again)
From Hard Rock (Whatever you say) Cafés (Make it go away)
That's where (I feel it crawl to me) she got her (Crawls back again)
Sweet tooth (Make it go away) for white boys (Whatever you say)

She runs from the third world, pearly

Use me, darling use me
Darling use me, darling use me

// A Reminder //

Ukončete výstup a nástup, dveře se zavírají
Příští stanice, Jiřího z Poděbrad

If I get old, I will not give in
But if I do, remind me of this
Remind me that once I was free
Once I was cool, once I was me
And if I sit down and cross my arms
Hold me up to this song

Knock me out, smash out my brains
If I take a chair, and start to talk shit

If I get old, remind me of this
The way that we kissed, and I really meant it
Whatever happens, if we're still speaking
Pick up the phone, play me this song

// Polyethylene (Parts 1 & 2) //

[Part 1]

Go!

Tears of joy now scare ourselves
From all that you want to be
Just got paid and now you're going
Round inside your place
If I get scared I'll just call you
And I'll miss your glow as I unsettle
Oh, and I'll always feel
I will always be-

[Part 2]

-a'right
One, two, three
Four

So sell your suit and tie
And come and live with me
Leukemia schizophrenia
Polyethylene
There is no significant risk to your health
She used to be beautiful once as well

Plastic bag, middle class
Polyethylene
Decaffeinate, unleaded
Keep all surfaces clean
If you don't believe me, sell your soul
If you don't get into it, no one will

Oh
Obtain
Obtain

// Melatonin //

Don't forget that you are our son
Now go back to bed

We just know that you'll do well
You won't come to harm

Death to all who stand in your way
Wake, my dear

// Palo Alto //

In a city of the future
It is difficult to concentrate
Meet the boss, meet the wife
Everybody's happy, everyone is made for life

In a city of the future
It is difficult to find a space
I'm too busy to see you
You're too busy to wait

But I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
But I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay, too

Every one of those days
When the sky's California blue
With a beautiful bombshell
I throw myself into my work
I'm too lazy
I've been kidding myself for so long

I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay, too
