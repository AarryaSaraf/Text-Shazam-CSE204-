// Banana Co. //

Oh, Banana Co
We really love you, and we need you
And oh, Banana Co
We'd really love to believe you

But everything's underground
We gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Oh, she said "No go"
She said she'd like to, she's seen you
And oh, Banana Co
She knows if you die then we all do

And everything's underground
We've gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Everything's burning down
We gotta put it out somehow
Yeah, yeah

// Bishop's Robes //

Dressed in bishop's robes
Terrifies me still in bishop's robes
Bastard headmaster

I am not going back
I am not going back
I am not going back

Children taught to kill
To tear themselves to bits on playing fields
Dressed in bishop's robes

I am not going back
I am not going back
I am not going back

// Coke Babies //

Easy living, easy hold
Easy teething, easy fold
Easy listening, easy love
Easy answers to easy questions

Easy tumble, easy fall
Easy rumble, easy doll
I get up on easy love
I get up on easy questions

// Cut A Hole //

Wish that I could come out of your phone
Superhero powers
Burst out of the sand
With a bunch of flowers
And you just say the word
Apparition comes
With a long and winning
Handsome smile
Wish we could connect
Step into the void
Off the diving board
Blend into the light
Down the cable lines
Roll under the earth
Reforming on the wind
Two places at once
Taste the air with you
Undo all the ties
Wish that I could flip
One of those lies
Lift this all away
See that stretchy smile go
Right across your face

Cut a hole
Cut a hole
A hole
A hole

// Cuttooth //

I will leave a wallpaper life
And run away to the foreign legion
I would leave a wallpaper life
And run away to the foreign legion
As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

Run until your lungs are sore
Until you cannot feel it anymore
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you find an open door
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to your feet and watch you drown
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to the stake and watch you burn in hell

I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

I'll find another skin to wear
I'll find another skin to wear

// Faithless The Wonder Boy //

I've had these jeans since I was born
And now they're ripped and now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards

I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But Mum and Dad will not give in

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

And now I know just what it is
It's got disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide

Too scared to talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye bye

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in...

// Fog //

There's a little child running around this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows, in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done

How, how did you go bad?
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

// Harry Patch (In Memory Of) //

I am the only one that got through
The others died wherever they fell
It was an ambush
They came up from all sides
Give your leaders each a gun and then let them
Fight it out themselves

I've seen devils coming up from the ground
I've seen hell upon this earth
The next will be chemical
But they will never learn

// How Can You Be Sure? //

Seen all the good things and bad
Running down the hill
All so battered and brought to the ground

I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends

When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing?
How can you be sure?
How can you be sure?

If you walk out the door
Will I see you again?
If so much of me lies in your eyes

I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends

When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing?
How can you be sure?
(I don't want you, I don't want you)
How can you be sure?
(I don't want you, I don't want you)
How can you be sure?
(I don't want you, I don't want you)
How can you be sure?
(I don't want you, I don't want you)

I don't want you
I don't want you anymore
I don't want you
I don't want you anymore

// How I Made My Millions //

I was stronger, I was better
Picked you out

Now don't say a word, no, don't yell out
Never mind

Let you let out, led you back
Stay on, sit down

Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall, let it fall

// I Promise //

I won't run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when you lock me out
I promise
I say my prayers every night
I promise

I know which side I'm spread
I promise
The tantrums and the chitty chats
I promise

Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotting deck
I promise

I won't run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise

Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotting deck
I promise

I won't run away no more
I promise

// I Want None Of This //

You can keep what you want
I want none of this
They're just bad memories
I don't want
In my sunshine (shine, shine)
You can pack it all up
And be gone
And be gone

If it matters to you
You can sell it all up
If the price feels right
I won't judge

If you get off your knees
You'll be out on the breeze
Take a lesson from me
Don't get stuck on a dream

// Ill Wind //

Keep your distance
Then no harm will come

No ill wind
Will blow
Will blow

Sudden words
Must never be spoken

An ill wind
Will blow
Will blow

Keep your cool
Do not give into emotion

An ill wind
Will blow
Will blow

// India Rubber //

Did it all for you to say
You never wanted me that way
Now the dogs have had their meat
I think I'll go plug in the mains

I tumble like a clown
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself into your hands

When you spare a make up smile
I'm instantly your biggest fan
How was I to know that you practiced it beforehand?

I tumble like a clown
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself into your hands

// Inside My Head //

What do you want from me, now you got me?
Now my fingers bleed, now they stare at me
I'm a coward now
I hold my peace
Now you tie me up to your feather bed
And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn
You won't let go
You won't let go

You're inside of my head
Inside of my head

What do you want from me, now you got me?
Now my energy, you suck from me
And I'm holding on
For dear life
Quit smothering me, quit laughing at me
I've got a disease, an English disease
It will not go
It will not go

You're inside of my head
Inside of my head

Whatever you put in that syringe
Whatever you really said to him
He's sitting there inside of me
And you bother me, you possess me
You're there again, ahead of me
And I won't let go, I won't let go

You're inside of my head
Inside of my head
Inside of my head, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Inside of my head

// Killer Cars //

Killer cars, cars
Killer cars

Too hard on the brakes again
What if these brakes just give in?
What if they don't get out of the way?
What if there's someone overtaking?
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
There could be an idiot on the road
The only kick in life is pumping his steel

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive

Don't die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldn't cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
What if the car loses control?
What if there's someone overtaking?

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive killer cars

Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk
No they won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars

Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars

// Kinetic //

You're being took for a ride
Pulling all the lazies

Please keep moving
Better keep moving

Don't fall asleep at the wheel
I waited for you but you never came
(Can't you stop the children screaming)

Please keep moving
Better keep moving

Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Please keep moving
Better keep moving
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic
Kinetic, kinetic, kinetic, kinetic

// Lift //

This is the place
Sit down, you're safe now
You've been stuck in a lift
We've been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It won't hurt ever again

The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it's time to come home

This is the place
Remember me? I'm the face you always see
You've been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean

The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it's time to come home
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Ah, let it go

Today is the first day
Of the rest of your days
So lighten up, squirt

// Lull //

You stop the crowd
I cried out to break the spell
You wake and smile
I just snapped and lost control

Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
The stress and the tension
I'm in a lull

There's nothing more dull
Than talking, talking about yourself
But what I meant to say
I'm sorry that I lost control

Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
Crawling through the keyhole
I'm in a lull

// Man Of War //

Drift all you like from ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
But drunken confessions and hijacked affairs
Will just make you more alone

When you come home I'll bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me dressed for the kill

You're my man of war
You're my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So unplug the phones, stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
To poison clouds and poisoned dwarves

You're my man of war
You're my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
For you, big boots

// Maquiladora //

Here it comes, here it comes
I can feel the hills exploding
Exploding gracefully
Burning up the freeway
Here it comes

Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful kids into beautiful trouble
Well it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn

Fast Toyota, burns rubber
Useless rockers from England
Good times had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your conscience

Blue and white birds stepping hard on the pedal,
Interstate Five runs straight down the middle
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn

// Million Dollar Question //

Was always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
And take a holiday

Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no-one's listening anyway
They're just trying to bribe me

And if it's alright, then what am I doing here?
And if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
And if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man

Today I wrote a bad cheque
Packed a bag and took a jet
But no-one's looking anyway
I hope they miss me

I just think maybe I'm making a mistake

// Molasses //

Shake hands, genocide, molasses
Jet powered caravans, molasses
I'm too good, you're stuck on
Rent free earthquake zone, molasses

I need someone else's glasses
Starving waitresses in plasters
Fat houseflies, genocide
We've been stitched up, molasses

// Pop Is Dead //

Oh no, Pop is dead, long live Pop
It died an ugly death by back-catalogue
And now you know it gets you nowhere
And now you know, you realize

Oh no, Pop is dead, it just gave up
We raised the dead but they won't stand up
And radio has salmonella
And now you know you're gonna die

He left this message for us

So what? Pop is dead, it's no great loss
So many facelifts, his face flew off
The emperor really has no clothes on
And his skin is peeling off

Oh no, Pop is dead, long live Pop,
One final line of coke to jack him off
Jack him off

He left this message for us
He left this message for us

He's dead, He's dead, Pop is dead
He's dead, He's dead, Pop is dead
He's dead, He's dead, Pop is dead

// Skirting On The Surface //

When we realise we are only to die then we're out of here
We're just skirting on the surface
We have only to click our fingers and we disappear
We're just skirting on the surface

Dull eyes trying to pull you through the ice
Being drawn to the ledge
When we realise that once we're broke then nothing mends
We're just skirting on the surface

When we realise we're only held in suspension
Till someone comes along and shakes us
And as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a web
Will we die upon the surface

Dull eyes trying to pull you through the ice
Being drawn to the ledge
When we realise that once we're broke then nothing mends
We're just skirting on the surface

// Spectre //

I'm lost, I'm a ghost
Dispossessed, taken host
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul

These rumours and suspicion
Anger is a poison

The only truth that I could see
Is when you put your lips to me
Futures tricked by the past
Spectre, how he laughs

Fear puts a spell on us
Always second-guessing love

My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul
The only truth that I can see
Spectre has come for me

// Staircase //

I walk down the staircase
Magnetic pull
Back to the other place
That I cannot go

I'm sending a chopper
To steal you away

The pot is full, let me take control
Let me take control
The pot is full of secrets to be told
Secrets to be told

Out of orbit
And I always will

The pot is full, let me take control
Let me take control
The pot is full of secrets to be told
Secrets to be told

// Stupid Car //

I find it hard
To drive your stupid car
I find it hard
'Cause I never get that far

And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gear
I cannot see the road

You got concrete eyes
But I cannot see your face
And I failed in life
'Cause you crushed me with your hands

And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gear
I cannot see the road, road

// Super Collider //

Supercollider
Dust in a moment
Particles scatter
Coming up from the soup
Swimming upstream
Before the heavens crack open
Thin pixelations
Coming up from the dust
In a blue light
In a green light
In a half-life
In an arc light
I'm a B-spin
Flip-flopping
I'm a pulse wave
Outstepping

I put the shadows back into their boxes

I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second
I have jettisoned
(Supercollider)
My illusions
(Dust in a moment)
I have dislodged
(Particles scatter)
My depressions
(Parting out from the soup)
I put the shadows back into their boxes
I put the shadows back into their boxes

I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony

// Talk Show Host //

I want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon the surface for
The birds, the birds
The birds

You want me?
Fuckin' well come and find me
I'll be waiting
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches
And nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

You want me?
Well, come on and break the door down
You want me?
Fuckin' come on and break the door down
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready

I'm ready

// The Amazing Sounds Of Orgy //

I want to see you smile again
Like diamonds in the dust
The amazing sound of the killing hordes
The day the banks collapsed on us

Cease this endless chattering
Like everything is fine
When sorry is not good enough
Sit in the back while no-one drives

So glad
So glad you're mine
So glad
So glad you're mine
So glad
So glad you're mine
So glad
So glad you're mine

// The Butcher //

Beauty will destroy your mind, spare the gory details
Give them gift-wrapped for the man with everything
Though I lived a lonely life, I was confused
A butcher, I feel nothing

As it courses up my arms in a position of the worms
Up, up, through my heart into my brain
Arm a bit slack, a basic combination
Cut out of chopped liver on the block
My heart's still pumping
My heart's still pumping

He's a warrior, a warrior
Here's a little bitch coming out of him
He's a warrior, a warrior
Here's a little bitch coming out of him
Coming out of him

// The Daily Mail //

The Moonies are up on the mountain
The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture
Singing, "We're here
To keep your prices down
Feed you to the hounds
To the Daily Mail"
Together, together

You made a pig's ear
You made a rude mistake
Paid off security
And got through the gate
You got away with it
But we lie in wait
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey

Where's the truth, what's the use
In hanging around, lost and found
With your head in the sand
Fat chance, no plan
No regard for human life
Keep trying, you've no right
Fast and loose, win or lose
Jumped the queue, go back again
President for life
Lord of all that flies in the sky
The beasts of the earth, the fish in the sea
You've lost command
Hey hey, hey hey hey
Uh uh, uh uh uh
Uh uh uh

// These Are My Twisted Words //

These are my twisted words
Went off the roof still walking
I know I should not look down
But I'm so sick of just talking

When are you coming back?
I just can't handle it
When are you coming back?
I just can't handle it

When are you coming back?
I just can't stand it
I just can't handle it

// Trans-Atlantic Drawl //

I was born
For your magazine, for your magazine
I am trapped in the society page
Of your magazines, of your magazine
I don't know what it means

Do you see light
At the end of the tunnel? At the end of the tunnel?
Do you see light
(These are things that get on my nerves)
At the end of the tunnel? At the end of the tunnel?
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
At the end of the tunnel?
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
Tunnel
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
Tunnel
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
Tunnel
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)

// Worrywort //

You don't want to talk to me
You don't want to say the words
Trying to get off the hook
Trying to get off the hook
Sprawling on a pin
Hanging off a hook
Trying to get yourself away
Trying to get yourself away

There's no use dwelling on
On what might have been
Just think of all the fun
You could be having
We know the way you talk
We know what you want
We know what you want
What you really want

Take a look around
The candles on the cake
On what might have been
The road you should have took
Mistakes, mistaken
There's no use dwelling on
No use dwelling on

It's such a beautiful day
It's such a beautiful day
Find yourself a moment
And go and get some wings

It's such a beautiful day
It's such a beautiful day
Go up to the mic, go up to the mic
Go and get some wings

// Yes I Am //

I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I don't have a choice
Anywhere I go
You are always there
Outside the car or in my hair

I think I've been here before
Yes, I've been here before
The last time you locked all the doors
And I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I don't have a choice

And yes, I am wary
Yes, I am
I am

Think I've told you once
Think I needed advice
You were such a help, that's very nice
Think I've been here before
Yes, I've been here before
But this time I kick down your door

Yes, I am wary
Yes, I am wary
