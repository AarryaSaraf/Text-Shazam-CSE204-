I am the only one that got through
The others died wherever they fell
It was an ambush
They came up from all sides
Give your leaders each a gun and then let them
Fight it out themselves

I've seen devils coming up from the ground
I've seen hell upon this earth
The next will be chemical
But they will never learn
