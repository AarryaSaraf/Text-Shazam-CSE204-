There's a little child running around this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows, in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done, how?

How did you go bad?
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

Goodnight, everybody
Thank you
