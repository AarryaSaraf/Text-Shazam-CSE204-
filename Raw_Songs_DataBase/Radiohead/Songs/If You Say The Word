If you're in a forest, out of your mind
Harpies in the branches breaking your arms
If you're stuck in rainbows of shattering glass
Where you miss the moment, watching it pass

If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word

When you spend your life wishing on a twinkling star
When you forget how lucky you are
Buried in rubble, sixty foot down

If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
Then I'll come running

When you change your friends, like changing your clothes

If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
Then I'll come running
I'll come running
