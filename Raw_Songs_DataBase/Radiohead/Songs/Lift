This is the place
Sit down, you're safe now
You've been stuck in a lift
We've been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It won't hurt ever again

The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it's time to come home

This is the place
Remember me? I'm the face you always see
You've been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean

The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it's time to come home
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Ah, let it go

Today is the first day
Of the rest of your days
So lighten up, squirt
