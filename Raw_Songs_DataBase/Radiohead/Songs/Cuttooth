I will leave a wallpaper life
And run away to the foreign legion
I would leave a wallpaper life
And run away to the foreign legion
As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

Run until your lungs are sore
Until you cannot feel it anymore
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you find an open door
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to your feet and watch you drown
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to the stake and watch you burn in hell

I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

I'll find another skin to wear
I'll find another skin to wear
