I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I don't have a choice
Anywhere I go
You are always there
Outside the car or in my hair

I think I've been here before
Yes, I've been here before
The last time you locked all the doors
And I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I don't have a choice

And yes, I am wary
Yes, I am
I am

Think I've told you once
Think I needed advice
You were such a help, that's very nice
Think I've been here before
Yes, I've been here before
But this time I kick down your door

Yes, I am wary
Yes, I am wary
