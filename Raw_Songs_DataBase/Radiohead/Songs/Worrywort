You don't want to talk to me
You don't want to say the words
Trying to get off the hook
Trying to get off the hook
Sprawling on a pin
Hanging off a hook
Trying to get yourself away
Trying to get yourself away

There's no use dwelling on
On what might have been
Just think of all the fun
You could be having
We know the way you talk
We know what you want
We know what you want
What you really want

Take a look around
The candles on the cake
On what might have been
The road you should have took
Mistakes, mistaken
There's no use dwelling on
No use dwelling on

It's such a beautiful day
It's such a beautiful day
Find yourself a moment
And go and get some wings

It's such a beautiful day
It's such a beautiful day
Go up to the mic, go up to the mic
Go and get some wings
