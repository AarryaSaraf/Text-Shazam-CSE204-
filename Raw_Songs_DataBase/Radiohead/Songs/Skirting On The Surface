When we realise we are only to die then we're out of here
We're just skirting on the surface
We have only to click our fingers and we disappear
We're just skirting on the surface

Dull eyes trying to pull you through the ice
Being drawn to the ledge
When we realise that once we're broke then nothing mends
We're just skirting on the surface

When we realise we're only held in suspension
Till someone comes along and shakes us
And as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a web
Will we die upon the surface

Dull eyes trying to pull you through the ice
Being drawn to the ledge
When we realise that once we're broke then nothing mends
We're just skirting on the surface
