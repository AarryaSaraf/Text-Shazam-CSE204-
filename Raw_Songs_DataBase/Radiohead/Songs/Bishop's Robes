Dressed in bishop's robes
Terrifies me still in bishop's robes
Bastard headmaster

I am not going back
I am not going back
I am not going back

Children taught to kill
To tear themselves to bits on playing fields
Dressed in bishop's robes

I am not going back
I am not going back
I am not going back
