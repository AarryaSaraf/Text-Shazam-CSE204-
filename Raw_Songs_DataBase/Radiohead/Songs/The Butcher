Beauty will destroy your mind, spare the gory details
Give them gift-wrapped for the man with everything
Though I lived a lonely life, I was confused
A butcher, I feel nothing

As it courses up my arms in a position of the worms
Up, up, through my heart into my brain
Arm a bit slack, a basic combination
Cut out of chopped liver on the block
My heart's still pumping
My heart's still pumping

He's a warrior, a warrior
Here's a little bitch coming out of him
He's a warrior, a warrior
Here's a little bitch coming out of him
Coming out of him
