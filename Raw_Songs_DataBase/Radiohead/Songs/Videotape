When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape
My videotape

When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me

This is one for the good days
And I have it all here in
Red blue green, in
Red blue green

You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape...

This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
So I'm talking to you before...

No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know
Today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen
