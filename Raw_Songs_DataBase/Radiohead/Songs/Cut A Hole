Wish that I could come out of your phone
Superhero powers
Burst out of the sand
With a bunch of flowers
And you just say the word
Apparition comes
With a long and winning
Handsome smile
Wish we could connect
Step into the void
Off the diving board
Blend into the light
Down the cable lines
Roll under the earth
Reforming on the wind
Two places at once
Taste the air with you
Undo all the ties
Wish that I could flip
One of those lies
Lift this all away
See that stretchy smile go
Right across your face

Cut a hole
Cut a hole
A hole
A hole
