I was born
For your magazine, for your magazine
I am trapped in the society page
Of your magazines, of your magazine
I don't know what it means

Do you see light
At the end of the tunnel? At the end of the tunnel?
Do you see light
(These are things that get on my nerves)
At the end of the tunnel? At the end of the tunnel?
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
At the end of the tunnel?
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
Tunnel
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
Tunnel
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
Tunnel
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
