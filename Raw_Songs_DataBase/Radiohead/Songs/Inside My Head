What do you want from me, now you got me?
Now my fingers bleed, now they stare at me
I'm a coward now
I hold my peace
Now you tie me up to your feather bed
And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn
You won't let go
You won't let go

You're inside of my head
Inside of my head

What do you want from me, now you got me?
Now my energy, you suck from me
And I'm holding on
For dear life
Quit smothering me, quit laughing at me
I've got a disease, an English disease
It will not go
It will not go

You're inside of my head
Inside of my head

Whatever you put in that syringe
Whatever you really said to him
He's sitting there inside of me
And you bother me, you possess me
You're there again, ahead of me
And I won't let go, I won't let go

You're inside of my head
Inside of my head
Inside of my head, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Inside of my head
