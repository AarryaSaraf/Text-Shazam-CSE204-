I see you in the dark
Corner of the street
Comin' after me, yeah
Headlights on full-beam
Comin' down the fast lane
Comin' after me

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Blowin' holes in everythin'
Thatcher's children
See you on the way back down
Drooling looney tunes
Movin' in a swarm
Movin' in a swarm

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah

Nowadays I get panicked
I cease to exist
I have ceased to exist
I feel absolutely nothin'
The words are out of ink
The words you know are out of ink

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
