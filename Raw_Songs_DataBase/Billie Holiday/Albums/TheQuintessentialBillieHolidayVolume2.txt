// These Foolish Things //

A cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
Still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin' words
That told you what my heart meant
A fair ground painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of march that made my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

// I Cried For You //

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
Now I've found two eyes
Just a little bit bluer
I've found a heart
Just a little bit truer
I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me

// A Fine Romance //

A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance

// Life Begins When You're In Love //

Life begins when you're in love
You have the whole world before you
When you've found the one
The only one to love and adore you
And when you learn the sigh of it
The long of it, the cry of it
Life begins when Cupid wins
And you're in love

// It's Like Reaching For The Moon //

It's like reaching for the moon
It's like reaching for the sun
It's like reaching for the stars
Reaching for you

You're so far above me
How can I expect an angel to love me
Who is so divine as you are?

It's like flying without wings
Playing fiddle without strings
And a million other things
No one can do
Though, my hopes are slender
In my secret heart I pray you'll surrender soon
Though, it's like reaching for the moon

// Guess Who //

Somebody thrills the skies
When she looks in your eyes
Guess who?
Guess who?
Somebody longs to be part
Of the song in your heart
Guess who?  Guess who?
Whose heart is sure to melt like butter
The moment that you utter
"I do","I do"
Oh it's as plain as can be
That the someone is me
So you don't have to
Guess who

// Did I Remember? //

Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am livin' for you alone
Did I remember to say
I'm lost without you
And just how mad about you I've grown
You were in my arms
And that was all I knew
We were alone, we two
What did I say to you
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forevermore you'll be mine

// No Regrets //

No regrets
Although our love affair has gone astray
No regrets
I know I'll always care though you're away
So now our happy romance ended suddenly
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine
No regrets
Because somebody new looks good to you
No regrets
Sweetheart no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger
When the other love forgets
So I say goodbye with no regrets

No regrets
Because somebody new looks good to you
No regrets
Sweetheart no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger
When the other love forgets
So I say goodbye with no regrets

// Summertime //

Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry

One of these mornings, you're goin' to rise up singin'
Then you spread your wings and you'll take the sky
But 'til that mornin', there's nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by

One of these mornings, you're goin' to rise up singin'
Then you spread your wings and you'll take the sky
But 'til that mornin', there's nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by

// Billie's Blues //

Lord I love my man, tell the world I do
I love my man, tell the world I do
But when he mistreats me
Makes me feel so blue

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long way to go

Some men like me talkin' happy
Some calls it snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I got money
Some tell me baby you're built for speed
Now if you put that all together
Makes me everthing a good man needs

// I Can't Pretend //

I can't pretend
I'm sorry we're apart
I can't pretend
I just can't fool my heart
Though I make mine
My friends all seem to realize
Their smiles, that look in my eye
I can't pretend
I simply can't be gayer
For in the end
My tears give me away
Without you dear
I live a lie
I can't defend
I love you
And I can't pretend

// One, Two, Button Your Shoe //

One two button your shoe
Put on your coat and hat
I'll play a game like that
While I'm waiting for you
Three tour open the door
Hurry for heaven's sake
I count each step you take
While I'm waiting for you
Five six my eyes are fixed
On that picture of your charm
Seven eight you're at the gate
And you walk into my arms
None ten kiss me again
Tell me you get a thrill
Just as I hope you will
While I'm waiting for you

// Let's Call A Heart A Heart //

When we're in a friendly situation
My conversation may not be smart
But if we're to have a perfect understanding
Let's call a heart a heart
There are words that should be whispered gent@y
That's evidently the way to start
If I tell you what my dreams have been demanding
Let's call a heart a heart

Can I prove how I yearn
Just by the turn of a phrase
Can I keep my control
When all my soul is aflame
Maybe we'd call a true confession
And in discretion on someone's part
But if I'm to say how madly I adore you
Let's call a heart a heart

// Easy To Love //

I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me
Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every homefire burning for
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love

// With Thee I Swing //

With thee I swing, baby
With thee it's just not a trance
With thee I cling, baby
Whenever I get a chance

With thee I swing, baby
For thou art so entrancin'
My heart goes bing, baby
Whenever we start to dance

With all the others
I'm only marking time
But in your arms I melt away
Like ice cream on a summer's day
Just one more thing, baby
My life won't he worthwhile
Till down the middle aisle
With thee I swing, baby

// The Way You Look Tonight //

Someday when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow
Just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Oh, but you're lovely
With your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me
But to love you
Just the way you look tonight
With each word
Your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh
That wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
Lovely, never never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it
Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
