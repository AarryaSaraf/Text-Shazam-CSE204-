// What A Little Moonlight Can Do //

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you

You're in love
Your heart's a flutter and all day long
You only shutter 
Cuz your poor tongue 
Just won't utter the words
I love you

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Wait a while
Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through

You'll get bold
You can't resist him
And all you'll say
When you have kissed him is

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do

// I Wished On The Moon //

I wished on the moon, for something I never knew
I wished on the moon, for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance away

I wished on the stars to throw me a beam or two
I begged of a stars and asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon for you

I wished on the moon, for something I never knew
I wished on the moon, for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance away

I wished on a stars to throw me a beam or two
I begged of a stars and asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon, wished on the moon for you
I wished on the moon for you

// Your Mother's Son-In-Law //

You don't have to have a hanker
To be a broker or a banker
No siree, just simply be
My mother's son-in-law.
Needn't even think of tryin'
To be a mighty social lion
Sipping tea, if you'll be
My mother's son-in-law,
Ain't got the least desire
To set the world on fire
Just wish you'd make it proper
To call my old man papa
You don't have to sing like Bledsoe
You can tell the world I said so
Can't you see you've got to be
My mother's son-in-law.

You don't have to sing like Jessel
You can tell the world I said so
Can't you see, you've got to be
My mother's son-in-law.

// Riffin' The Scotch //

I jumped out of the tryin' pan
And right into the fire
When I lost me a cheatin' man
And got a no-count liar
Swapped the old one for a new one
Now the new one's breakin' my heart
I jumped out of the tryin' pan
And right into the fire
Lord, right into the fire

// Miss Brown To You //

Who do you think is comin' to town
You'll never guess who
Lovable, hugable Emily Brown
Miss Brown to you
What if the rain comes pattering down
My heaven is blue
Can it be sending me Emily Brown
Miss Brown to you
I know her eyes will thrill ya
But go slow, oh, oh
Don't you all get too familiar
Why do you think she's comin' to town
Just wait and you'll see
The lovable little Miss Brown to you
Is baby to me, yes, yes
Mark it down

// A Sunbonnet Blue (And A Yellow Straw Hat) //

A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Shy little he and she
Were declaring love's old story
In the shade of the old apple tree,

A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Decided to say, "I do"
So they rode to june and glory
On a bicycle built for two

Hear the past.	the song is old.
The summer days are through
With silver threads among the gold
They still say, "I love you"

A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Are true to this very day
For he loves her in december
As he did in may

// What A Night, What A Moon, What A Girl //

What a night!
What a moon'
What a boy!
What a moon'
What a night!
What a boy!
Those white clouds hang in the air
Like toy balloons
Say, they just hang in the air
That's made for honeymoons
What a hug!

What a kiss!

What a boy!

What a game!  Oh, what bliss!
What a boy!

Is it a wonder
My heart is full of joy?
What a night!
What a moon'
What a boy!

// I'm Painting The Town Red //

A smile on my face
A song on my lips
Pretending is all I do
I'm painting the town red
To hide a heart that's blue

I'm gay with the crowd
I play with the crowd
But oh, if they only knew
I'm painting the town red
To hide a heart that's blue
Must I go on carrin' on?

My merry song is just pretend
Loving you so, wanting you so
Where will it end, how will it end?

A smile on my face
A song on my lips
But never forgetting you
I'm painting the town red
To hide a heart that's blue

// It's Too Hot For Words //

It's too hot for words
Why bother with conversation
Don't let's talk or even walk
If you want to make love, okay

It's too hot for words
There's nothing like relaxation
Can't ignore this temperature
But if you want to make love, okay

Let's find a cozy nook
Beside a babbling brook
Let's find a shady tree
Let the love birds talk for you and me

Cause it's much too hot for words
Why bother with conversation
Goodness knows my heart disclose
All it dares to say
All it cares to say
It's too hot for words

// Twenty-Four Hours A Day //

Like a little old fashioned music box
With just one tune to play
My heart keeps singin' I love you
Twenty four hours a day

Like a little old fashioned music box
That skips a note or two
My heart keeps missin' a heart beat
Singin' its song about you
And although the song we know is old
It's still the sweetest story ever told

// Yankee Doodle Never Went To Town //

Yankee Doodle never went to town
I just discovered the story was phony
Let me give you all the real low-down
He didn't even own a pony
He was really very short and fat
While in the story so skinny and moany
And so hungry that he ate his hat
And called the felt macaroni
Underneath the chestnut tree
He and the blacksmith would sip that tea
Then he'd bring out his uniform down
That's how he went to town

Yankee Doodle tried to leave one day
Took his belongings and mounted his saddle
But he never got it on his way
Cause he didn't have a pony
And the fairy tale is phony
How could Yankee Doodle go to town?

// Eeny Meeny Meiny Mo //

Eeny meeny miney mo
Catch your troubles by the toe
If it hollers let it go
Let it fly away
Eeny meeny miney mo
It's the saying high and low
Hear it everywhere you go
Every time of day
Big Ben rings it
Vallee sings it
Whitewood swings it
Even Mr. Crosby bings it

// If You Were Mine //

If you were mine
I could be a ruler of kings
And if you were mine
I could do such wonderful things
I'd say to the stars
"Stop where you are
Light up my lover's way"
And every star above you would obey

If you were mine
I would live for your love alone
To kneel at your shrine
I would give up all that I own
Yes, even my heart
Even my life
I'd trade it all for you
And think I was lucky too
If you were mine

// These 'n' That 'n' Those //

These are nights below
And that's the moon above
And those are eyes that say you're mine
Why can't we combine these'n that'n those
These are moments rare
And that's the comfy chair
And those are lips that should be kissed
How can we resist these'n that'n those
Holding conversation is no recreation
And we have so much more to do
I'd be disrespectful
If I were neglectful
Of all that nature gave to you
These two hearts are bold
And that's a hand to hold
And those two arms have room to spare
Where we both can share these'n that'n those

// You Let Me Down //

You told me that I was like an angel
Told me I was fit to wear a crown
So that you could get a thrill
You put me on a pedestal
And then you let me down, let me down.

You told me that I'd be wearing diamonds
I would have the smartest car in town
Made me think that I'm the top
And then you let the ladder drop
You know you let me down, let me down

I walked upon a rainbow
I clung onto a star
You had me up in heaven
That's why I had to tall so far

I was even looking for a cottage
I was measured for a wedding gown
That how I got cynical
You put me on a pinnacle
And then you let me down, let me down
How you let me down

// Spreadin' Rhythm Around //

Music everywhere, feet are pattin'
Puttin' tempo in old manhattan
Everybody is out high hattin'
Spreadin' rhythm around

Everywhere you go trumpets are blarin'
Drums and saxophones rip and tearin'
Everybody you meet is rarin'
Spreadin' rhythm around

Up in harlem in every flat they give it that zing
Which according to one and all is what they call swing

Those who can't afford silk and satin
Dance with gigolos who are latin
Come from yonkers, the bronx and staten
Spreadin' rhythm around
