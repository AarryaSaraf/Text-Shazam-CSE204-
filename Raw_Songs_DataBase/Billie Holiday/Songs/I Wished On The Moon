I wished on the moon, for something I never knew
I wished on the moon, for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance away

I wished on the stars to throw me a beam or two
I begged of a stars and asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon for you

I wished on the moon, for something I never knew
I wished on the moon, for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance away

I wished on a stars to throw me a beam or two
I begged of a stars and asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon, wished on the moon for you
I wished on the moon for you
