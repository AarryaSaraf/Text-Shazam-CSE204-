Yankee Doodle never went to town
I just discovered the story was phony
Let me give you all the real low-down
He didn't even own a pony
He was really very short and fat
While in the story so skinny and moany
And so hungry that he ate his hat
And called the felt macaroni
Underneath the chestnut tree
He and the blacksmith would sip that tea
Then he'd bring out his uniform down
That's how he went to town

Yankee Doodle tried to leave one day
Took his belongings and mounted his saddle
But he never got it on his way
Cause he didn't have a pony
And the fairy tale is phony
How could Yankee Doodle go to town?
