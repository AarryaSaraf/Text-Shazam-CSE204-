Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissin'
But night time is my time for reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else

There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue

I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and give back tomorrow
Your love is my love, there's no love for nobody else

Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissin'
But night time is my time for reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else

There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue

I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and give back tomorrow
Your love is my love, there's no love for nobody else
