Down by the docks
The weather was fine
The sailors were drinking American wine
And I wished I could go back to spring again

Now they're all gone
That's life moving on
Some stayed behind to get drunk on the song
And they wish they could go back to spring again
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring

The noise of the town
The salt in the air
It plays all around but I no longer care
And I wish I could go back to spring again
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring

They try words
And down through the years
It all turns to tears
They don't know
But they try anyway

The clouds cleared up
The sun hit the sky
I watched all the folks go to work
Just to die
And I wished I could go back to spring again
