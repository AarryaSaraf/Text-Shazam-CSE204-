London's fine
Did my time
Threshed the truth
Out the lie

Snowman coal'd
Pigeon holed
Cooed to death
Pilgrim soul

Curtain closed
System froze
Wait for me
Braver be

Dragged old man
Kissed and ran
Licked away
Osprey tan

Living in America
Living in America

London's fun
Been and done
One for all
All for one

Hit the town
Fit the crown
Heavy head
Hanging down

If you don't know
We will not go
Turning your tricks like a newborn gangster

You need not be
Born wealthy
If you care
You're the heir

Living in America
Living in America

A young wind blows
Through your hair
Bald-e-grayed
Some of them stayed

You're about as old
As the last day
You felt young
I dare say

If you don't know
We will not go
Turning your tricks like a newborn gangster

You need not be
Born wealthy
If you care
You're the heir

Living in America
Living in America
Living in America
Living in America
