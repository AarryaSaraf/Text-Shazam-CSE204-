Strange face, with your eyes so pale and sincere
Underneath, you know well you have nothing to fear
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life where Spring is sprung

So forget this cruel world where I belong
I'll just sit and wait and sing my song
But while the Earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky on the crest of a wave
