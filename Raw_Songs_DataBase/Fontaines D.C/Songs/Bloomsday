Saw the city hall in flames
I suppose it doesn't do as much these days
You put on your coat and smile
Saddest one I've seen for a country mile
Brought it down the road, Quicksmart
There's always fuckin' rain and it's always dark
When you were at the gate soaked through
Let's not say a word if it isn't true

Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday

Cordoned off the rest, too young
Looking for a thing no do-er's done
We won't find it here my love
Drinking with the tourists and fighting in front of them
Oh, to be young
Once more
I know all the lines lived it all before
When you were at the gate soaked through
Never said a word that wasn't true

Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday

Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday
