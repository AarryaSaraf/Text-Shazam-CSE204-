The breeze in the night time would kill you stone dead
It was the message I heard when the company said
"There is no warning and there is no future"
I like the way they treat me but I hate the way they use her
I hate the way they use her

I never really read
I spent the day in bed
And my hair was red
And my eyes weren't dead
I was a cool cool kid on the curbstone scene
And the lights in my eyes they were evergreen
Like you never seen

The breeze in the night time would kill you stone dead
It was the message I heard when the company said
"There is no warning and there is no future"
I like the way they treat me but I hate the way they use her
I hate the way they use

Well, I never really read
I spent the day in bed
And my hair was red
And my eyes weren't dead
I was a cool cool kid on the curbstone scene
And the lights in my eyes they were evergreen
Just like you've never seen before

They said the breeze in the night time would kill you stone dead
It was the message I heard when the company said
"There is no warning, there's no future"
I like the way they treat me but I hate the way they use her
I hate the way they use

Hey love

Are you hanging on?

Hey love
Are you hanging on?
