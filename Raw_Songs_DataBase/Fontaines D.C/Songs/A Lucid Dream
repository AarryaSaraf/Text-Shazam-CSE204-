I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking them, there
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the clouds opened up
For the aul' ones to look down
And detail, in books, the affair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing is that the rain changed
Direction before you were there
Ah

I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking them, there
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the bulletin board
Was shot up like a ward full of junk
And all kinds of despair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing is that the rain changed
Direction before you were there
Ah-ah

Under fallen colours gone unthrown
Ah, you're all prone
To being anyone else
Other than you?
Are you all prone?
Does anyone know?
And they just wanna come to your place and see you sing

I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking them, there
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the clouds opened up
For the aul' ones to look down
And detail, in books, the affair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing is that the rain changed direction

I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking them, there
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the bulletin board
Was shot up like a ward full of junk
And all kinds of despair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing is that the rain changed direction
Before you were there
Ah
