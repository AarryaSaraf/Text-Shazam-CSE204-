City boy reaches for the lonely heiress
Shes got a fruit fly buzzing round her head
And the boys are in a pack
They're looking for some some liquor
Coming up with ways to make daddy go quicker
Showing off his dimonds to a down town girl
Her eyes are like stars and they shine like pearls
He gets a kiss of credit and a crank of the engine
Ready now to give his dad all of his attention

I want to see some other places
I want a single resignation from the races
I want to feel it, winter in the sun
I want to feel my soul coming undone
I want to go back home
I want to sing with all the people I know
I want to see them, go around pleasing
I want to bring them to the show just to say hello

The heiresses caught a column in the paper 'bout the poor
She was startled by a picture of a kid laid on the floor
She thought about her future didn't want it anymore
So she threw it in the river prayed it never came ashore
She pulled up in a limo and she'd 
And throw herself into the ring with people from the scene
As soon as people knew her as the one from Terenure
Who wears her designer mittons while she's helping out the poor

I want to see some other places
I want a single resignation from the races
I want to feel it, winter in the sun
I want to feel my soul coming undone
I want to go back home
I want to sing with all the people I know
I want to see them, go around pleasing
I want to bring them to the radio show
I want to bring them to the show and say hello
Just say hello
