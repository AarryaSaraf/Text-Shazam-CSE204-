She defines the only answer
And I never had the time
She defines the only reason
For feeling
All in all is all we tailor
And they always have the best
And she defines the only reason
For feeling

Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day

She defines the only answer
And I never had the time
She defines the only reason
For feeling
All in all is all we tailor
And they always have the best
And she defines the only reason
For feeling, ah, ah

Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

She defines the only answer
And I never had the time
She defines the only answer
To feeling
All in all is all we tailor
And they always had the best
She defines the only reason

Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

// Big Shot //

You've been through the war
But you've nothing to show
I traveled to space
Found the moon too small
And home is a pin
Rusting through a map
I go there to pray
Do my resting at mass

Everybody gets a big shot, baby
Everybody gets a big shot lately
Everybody gets a big shot, baby

You choose to show when you know
No one's watching how you spread
Empty scum, forget their name
Nothing scratches off your blame

I've been leaving it all
I've been living it all
I've been leaving it all
I've been living it all
I've been leaving it all
I've been living it all
I've been leaving it all

Everybody gets a big shot, baby
Everybody gets a big shot lately
Everybody gets
Everybody gets

// How Cold Love Is //

How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is

They sit in their room
They all consume
They fall in their bed
They wanna go dead
They sit in their room
They all consume
They fall in their bed
They wanna go dead

How cold love is
How cold love is

My, my
I've been so entwined
And the feeling's coming for the millionth time
And the answer is so sweet
And the days, they just seem to follow me
My, my
I've been so entwined
And the feeling's coming with the finish line
And the anti, is so cold
So cold

So cold
So cold
So cold
So cold
So cold
So cold

They sit in their room
They all consume
They fall in their bed
They wanna go dead
They sit in their room
They all consume
They fall in their bed
They shouldn't have said

How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is

// Jackie Down The Line //

Do do do
La la la

My friend Sally says she knows ya
Got a funny point of view
Says you got away with murder
Maybe one time, maybe two

Something happens in the morning
When I can't see those failing eyes
I can't find a good word for ya
Does it come as a surprise?

I don't think we'd rhyme
I will wear you down in time
I will hurt you, I'll desert you
I am Jackie down the line

Said did Sally 'bout a future
Before you bored of her as well
If all you want is entertainment
If you can't have it you make hell

Don't make no odds for ye
To be told, yeah
Don't make no odds for ye
To be told, yeah

I don't think we'd rhyme
I will wear you down in time
I will hurt you, I'll desert you
I am Jackie down the line
I don't think we'd rhyme
I will make your secrets mine
I will hate ye, I'll debase ye
I am Jackie down the line

Do do do
La la la

So come on down to Sally's boneyard
See her spirit in decline
See the handsome mourners crying
They hawked a beating heart for a sturdy spine, yeah

What good is happiness to me
If I've to wield it carefully?
For care I'll always come up short
It's only right

I don't think we'd rhyme
I will wear you down in time
I will hurt ye, I'll desert ye
I'm one Jackeen of a line
I don't think we'd rhyme
I will take up all your time
I will chew ye, I'll go through ye
I am Jackie down the line
I don't think we'd rhyme
I will make your secrets mine
I will hate ye, I'll debase ye
I am Jackie down the line
And I will stone ye, I'll alone ye
I am Jackie down the line
If I can make you, I can break you
I am Jackie down the line
I am Jackie down the line

Do do do
La la la

// Bloomsday //

Saw the city hall in flames
I suppose it doesn't do as much these days
You put on your coat and smile
Saddest one I've seen for a country mile
Brought it down the road, Quicksmart
There's always fuckin' rain and it's always dark
When you were at the gate soaked through
Let's not say a word if it isn't true

Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday

Cordoned off the rest, too young
Looking for a thing no do-er's done
We won't find it here my love
Drinking with the tourists and fighting in front of them
Oh, to be young
Once more
I know all the lines lived it all before
When you were at the gate soaked through
Never said a word that wasn't true

Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday

Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday
Bloomsday

// Roman Holiday //

Baby, come on get stoned, get stoned
Get inside it, inside it, inside it, inside
Get along, get along, get alone, get alone, get
Heard about the week on the Dalymount seat, yeah

Baby, come on 'fore the going gets gone
Heard you lied to the Major, won't be long
Well I wish upon a wedding for a picture in the star
When they knock for ya don't forget who you are
Skinty Fia

Baby, come on whose side are you on?
I don't wanna see the queen, I already sing her song
While they're snuffing out hopes and they're blotting out suns
They claim to know the form in which genius comes, yeah

Baby, come on get your high heels on
It's the body is cold, it's the course is run
What artless living all this soft pain thrills
What calamities usher all our brilliance to the hills
Can you feel it?

Baby, come on get stoned, get stoned
Get inside it, inside it, inside it, inside
Get along, get along, get alone, get alone, get
Was it the weed or the moment that stoned ya?

Baby, come on get the hourglass on
I will dart into town, no I won't be long
If the talk's getting cold, we'll be chancing none
Well you know what I'm saying, our day will come
Can you feel it?
Won't be long
Can you feel it?

// The Couple Across The Way //

Babe, it feels like it's all happened
Twenty-three years of the same
And I'm sorry 'bout this morning
For the damage I will pay

All the mirrors face the walls and
I wake just to long for bed
Love what's got you so down low?
The saddest tongue is in your head

I forget the thrill of lies
The truth escaping through the eyes, now
You use voices on the phone
That once were spent on me

The world has changed beyond our doorstep
People talk and dress so strange
I don't know a neighbour's name
And all of life is rearranged

Nice to know that you're still caring
Well enough to raise your voice
But if we must bring up the past then
Please don't speak to me of choice

Across the way moved in a pair
With passion in its prime
Maybe they look through to us
And hope that's them in time

// Skinty Fia //

Does you really don't know where the avenuers go?
Are you lying through your teeth or are they paying through your nose?
A set of manners and a smile is all they want you for
But we can talk about it later
You can read it in the paper

I hated you away from the very start
I seen you sticking to your smile, it's gone and broken my heart
Now the wind is making work of every step on the bridge
You say, "I used to say we found each other, now I don't know
Where he is"

You get that feel, make your spirit shine
I let her prise apart my ribcage like a crackhead at the blinds
It hurt
But come the downing of the scrapyard sun
There is no light falls on our failure
It ain't covered in the paper

Well I really don't care what you think of me
But something gears me to the grovel every opportunity
I've got that jealous stripe
I probably am that type
I'll see you twenty Marys later
When your tongue is talking straighter

Heard he took 'em all down to the mercenary bar
I heard she broke up with her fella now he's drinkin' in his car
Nah
I'm not inclined towards the scandalous word
But on the subject of myself I do believe what I've heard

There is a track beneath the wheel and it's there till we die
She says, "I don't agree with nothing" I say, "Neither do I"
Go to sleep
There's not a thing can't be fixed with a dream
And we can talk about it later
You can read it in the paper

I bet ya, I bet ya
You had your smile, you had your smile
For the open mile
I bet ya, I bet ya
You had your smile, your face defile
For the open mile
I bet ya, I bet ya
I bet you now
I bet ya, I bet ya
I bet you now
I bet ya, I bet ya
I bet ya
I bet you now

// I Love You //

I love you, I love you, I told you I do
It's all I've ever felt, I've never felt so well
And if you don't know it, I wrote you this tune
To be here loving you when I'm in the tomb
I've eddied the heart now from Dublin to Paris
And if there was sunshine, it was never on me
So close the rain, so pronounced is the pain
Yeah

Well, I love you, imagine a world without you
It's only ever you, I only think of you
And if it's a blessing, I want it for you
If I must have a future, I want it with you
System in our hearts, you only had it before
You only opened the window, never opened up the door
And I love you, I love you, told you I do

Selling genocide and half-cut pride I understand
I had to be there from the start, I had to be the fucking man
It was a clamber of a life I sucked the ring off every hand
Had 'em plying me with drink, even met with their demands
When the cherries lined up I kept the spoilings for myself
Till I had 30 ways of dying looking at me from the shelf
A cloud-parting smile I had, a real good child I was
But this island's run by sharks with children's bones stuck in their jaws
Now the morning's filled with cokeys tryna talk you through it all
Is their mammy Fine Gael and is their daddy Fianna Fáil?
And they say they love the land but they don't feel it go to waste
Put a mirror to the youth and they will only see their face
Makes flowers read like broadsheets, "every young man wants to die"
Say it to the man who profits and the bastard walks by
And the bastard walks by, and the passer walks by
Say it to him fifty times and still the bastard won't cry
Would I lie?

I love you, I love you, I told you I do
It's all I've ever felt, I've never felt so well
And if you don't know it, I wrote you this tune
To be here lovin' you when I'm in the tomb
System in our hearts, you only had it before
Echo, echo, echo, the lights they go
The lights they go, the lights they go
Echo, echo

Selling genocide and half-cut pride I understand
I had to be there from the start I had to be the fucking man
It was a clamber of a life, I sucked the ring off every hand
Had 'em plying me with drink, even met with their demands
And I loved ye like a penny loves the pocket of a priest
And I'll love you till the grass around my gravestone is deceased
And I'm heading for the cokeys, I will tell them 'bout it all
About the gall of Fine Gael and the fail of Fianna Fáil
And now the flowers read like broadsheets, every young man wants to die
Say it to the man who profits and the bastard walks by
And the bastard walks by, and the passer walks by
Say it to him fifty times and still the bastard won't cry
Would I lie?

I did you a favor
