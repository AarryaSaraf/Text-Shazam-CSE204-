Album: StiffUpperLip

// Stiff Upper Lip //

Well, I was out on a drive, on a bit of a trip
Looking for thrills to get me some kicks
Now, I warn you ladies, I shoot from the hip
I was born with a stiff â€“ stiff upper lip

Like a dog and I howl
I bite everything
And I'm big and I know
And I'll ball your thing

I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot, and I shoot
Shoot from the hip
Yeah, I shoot from the hip

Now listen

Well, I'm working it out
And I've done everything, yeah
And I can't reform, no
Can you feel my sting?

I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot, and I shoot
Shoot from the hip
Yeah, I shoot from the hip

Well, I'm out on the prowl
And I'll ball your thing
I got the teeth that'll bite you
Can you feel that sting?

Babe, I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot, shoot
Shoot from the hip

I got a (stiff upper lip)
Better believe me (stiff upper lip)
Coming down (stiff upper lip)
See my (stiff upper lip)
Yeah, I got a (stiff upper lip)
Stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
I got a stiff upper lip
I got a stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
And I shoot
And I shoot
And I shoot
Shoot from the hip

// Meltdown //

I look at my watch to find out
The right time of day
I look at her libido
Hey, hey, hey
I'm gonna get off and come home
And roll her on the hay
Making her sweat, temperature rise
All through the day

Man, it's getting hot, hot, hot
I said, man, it's getting hot, hot, hot
It's getting hotter
And hotter
Man, it's getting hot, hot
Gettin' hot around here

It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown

I got a feelin' in my bones
I've been racking my brains out
All night long
Stokin' up the fire
Take it right up to the wire
Burning on and on
Burning on

Man it's getting hot hot hot
I said man it's getting hot hot hot
It's getting hotter and hotter
Man it's getting hot hot
Getting hot around here

It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
Meltdown

Man it's getting hot hot hot
I said man it's getting hot hot hot
It's getting hotter and hotter
And hotter and hotter

It's a meltdown, it's a meltdown
It's a meltdown, it's a meltdown
It's a meltdown, it's a meltdown
I said down down
It's a meltdown, meltdown, meltdown
It's a meltdown, it's a meltdown

// House Of Jazz //

Humdinger, bell ringer
Got a nasty stinger, to slow you down
Mud slinger, gold digger
Who point the finger, an' do you down
Kicking and a-fighting on the T.V. show
Lightnin', blindin' in the middle of the road

Are you coming in?
Are you coming in?
I said

Come into the house of
Come into the house of
Come into the house of jazz
Come into the house of
Come into the house of
Come into the house of jazz
Yes

Pole stripper, big tipper
Got a slappin' tickler, to make you groan
A-spittin' and a-bitin' on the T.V. show
Tightenin', fightin' and givin' out her love

Are you coming in?
Are you coming in?
I said

Come into the house of
Come into the house of
Come into the house of jazz
Come into the house of
Come into the house of
Come into the house of jazz
Yes

Well, are you coming in?

// Hold Me Back //

I got a big, fat Cadillac built for you
I got a honk that'll blow the avenue
Got a hard enough kicking, now bend my thing
Got a sugar looking woman with a bald-headed man
Give me Five-0, here boy, that's what I'll do
Got a big fat mama who can hold a tune
Gotta slip that bone in hard and mean
A honky-tonk woman got the best of me

Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back, you get a heart attack
Can't hold me back

Got a honky-tonk big bone, hit to thrill
I got a sugar boot 'n' money babies that'll kill
All honky tonk 15 golden mile
Got a blonde-headed woman loaded in the town
You can get me to the ball, man, divin' in
And don't balk the kill, ball in her 'ville
You gotta a map the wrong town, hit the road
You got a whole boppa movin' on down the road

Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back, you get a heart attack
Can't hold me back

Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back, you get a heart attack
Can't hold me back

Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back, you get a heart attack
Can't hold me back

Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back, you get a heart attack
Can't hold me back

Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back, you get a heart attack
Can't hold me back

// Safe In New York City //

Hello, baby, give me your hand
Check out the high spots, the lay of the land
We don't need a rocket or a big limousine
Ooh, come on over, baby, and I'll make you obscene

I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City

All over the city and out of the dives
Don't mess with this place, it'll eat you alive, yeah
Got a lip smacking honey to suck out the jam
On top of the world ma, ready to slam

I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City

Moving all over like a jumping bean
Take a look at that thing in the tight-ass jeans
Coming your way now, you may be in luck
Don't you fret boy, she's ready to buck

I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City

Raging
New York
New York
New York

I'd feel safe in a cage in New York City
Throw away the key

// Can't Stand Still //

When I see a pretty woman
You know it give me a thrill
And she's tailor made to order
You know I can't stand still
And you won't need a doctor
'Cause it'll cure all ills
And when I hear a noisy party
You know it give me a chill
It gets me rockin' and a-rollin'
And I can't stand still
From mornin' till midnight
You know I can't stand still

You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
From morning till midnight
You know I can't stand still
Ooh yeah

Well, when it comes to sippin' honey
You know I drink my fill
And I've been dancin' on the water
You know I can't stand still
From mornin' 'till midnight
You know I can't stand still
Ooh yeah

You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
From morning till midnight
You know I can't stand still
Ooh yeah

You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
From morning till midnight
You know I can't stand still
Ooh yeah

You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
From morning till midnight
You know I can't stand still
Ooh yeah

Thank you, lads, thank you!)

// Satellite Blues //

She make the place a-jumping
The way she move around
She like a romp and rolling
That's why she get it out
And when she start a-rocking
She bring me to the boil
She like to give it out some

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

A picture clear for watching
The dish is running hot
The box is set for pumping
She gonna take the lot
The way she get the butt in
She's getting set to ball
I like to chew it up some

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

Can't get nothing on the dial
The frigging thing gone wild
All I get's the dumbed-down news
New satellite blues

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

This thing nothing but a load of crap
I'm gonna send it right back
You can stick it where it hurts, Mac
Oh yeah

// Damned //

Don't smoke, don't fight, don't light no cigarettes
Or else you'll wind up in the can
No jokes, don't write, sit tight, don't fool around
You are a guest of Uncle Sam
Stand up, look right, don't slouch and stand at ease
Allow no sex above the knees
And when I snap, you jump into the master plan

I'll be damned
Well, I'll be damned
I'll be

Damned, if I drink or smoke
Damned, if I steal your joke
I'll be damned, if I go for broke
Damned, if I do
Damned, if I don't

Don't talk, don't fool, don't try to mess around
I'll make a monkey out of you
You sign your name right on that dotted line

Boy, I'll be damned
I'll be

Damned, if I drink or smoke
Damned, if I steal your joke
I'll be damned, if I go for broke
Damned, if I do
Damned, if I don't

Damned, if I drink or smoke
Damned, if I steal your joke
I'll be damned, if I go for broke
Damned, if I do
Damned, if I don't

Damned, if I drink or smoke
Damned, if I steal your joke
I'll be damned, if I go for broke
Damned, if I do
Damned, if I don't

I'll be damned
I'll be damned
I'll be damned
I'll be damned
I'll be damned
I'll be damned

// Come And Get It //

Picking up the sleaze in my car
Hell no distance too far
Burning down the road in the night
Don't you scold me or I'll bite

These are the finer things in life
Don't think you live in paradise
I've got my filly wrapped in red
Upon my double-decker bed

If you want it come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it come and get it

Sucking up the juice in the bar
Downing every shooter so far
Checking out the girls what a sight
If you gonna blow me do it right

These are the finer things in life
Don't think you live in paradise
I've got my filly wrapped in red
Upon my double decker bed

If you want it come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it come and get it

Come and get it

If you want it come and get it
If you want it come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it come and get it (come and get it)
I said If you want it (come and get it)
If you want it (come and get it)
If you want it
If you want it
If you want it come and get it
Come and get it right here

// All Screwed Up //

Get ready!

You think you're kinda tough
You're walking kinda rough
When you want any more
You go fast whoa, whoa, whoa

Things go tough
And you strut your stuff
And I want your thing
Then you're out of luck
Yes, you are

It's all screwed up
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
All screwed up

Take you out to kick some butt
Work you over, screw you nuts
And when you can't take no more
Then she push you out the door

And things go hard
Like a dog gone mad
She can pack some punch
Then, you're out to lunch (back at 1:00)

It's all screwed up
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
All screwed up

It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
Can't tell one from the other
All screwed up

I said, it's all screwed up
All screwed up
Said, you're all screwed up
All screwed up
It's all screwed up (yes it is)
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
All screwed up

Screwed up
It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
Said, you think you pack some punch
But you're always out to lunch
It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
Yes it is
All screwed up
It's all screwed up, yeah

// Give It Up //

Well, there'll be no words of fighting, around here
'Cause nothing don't matter, 'cause it ain't clear
Well, it could be on a Monday
Or it could be even a Sunday
So, if you can't stand the distance, you better disappear
Do I make myself clear?

I'm ready to rock, I'm going to rip it
Ready to rock, yeah, I'm going to stick it

Give it up, give it out
Whip it up, all about
Stick it up, shout it loud
Come on
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up

Well, there's a big storm a-howlin', around here
And there be no wine, no cinnamon and no beer
I'm gonna aim to fire a rocket
There ain't no damn way to stop it
I got a sure-fire bullet
To get you outta here
I said, do I make myself clear?

I'm ready to rock, I'm going to rip it
Ready to rock, yeah, I'm going to stick it

Give it up, give it out
Whip it up, all about
Stick it up, shout it loud
Come on
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up

I'm goin' crazy on a wild man night
Take your pick of anything you like
Give it up
Give it up
Sitting pretty, all ready to bite
She givin' up a bit of cream delight

Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
You gotta give it up, give it out
Whip it up, all about
You gotta stick it up, shout it loud
Give it up, all around (give it up)
Give it up, give it up, give it up (givin' it up)
Whippin' it in, whippin' it out (givin' it up)
Stick it up, stick it up, stick it out (givin' it up)
Give it up, all around
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Givin' it up, stickin' it out
Givin' it up, givin' it up

Give it up
Do I make myself clear?
