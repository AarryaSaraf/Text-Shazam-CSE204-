// Realize //

The moment you realize
Those moments just pass you by
Gonna take you to paradise

Move it
Make you prove it, yeah
Breakin' out
Break it down
Feel the chills, feel the chills
Movin' down your spine

(Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh)
When we recall and
Realize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Make you realize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I've got the power to hypnotize
Make a play, mesmerize
Feel the chills up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly

Your eye's playin' tricks on you
Your mind will seek the truth
You know you're gonna make it through

I said move it
Make you prove it
Shake it up, shake it down
Feel the chills, feel the chills
Movin' down your spine

(Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh)
When we recall and
Realize, hey yeah (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Gonna make you realize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I got the power to electrify
Make a play to satisfy
Feel a chill up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly
Fly, fly

When we recall and
Realize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Gonna make you realize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I got the power to hypnotize
Make a play, mesmerize
Feel the chills up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly

// Rejection //

You better give me what I want
Or I'll bleed on you
You don't give me what I need
And I'll come for you
Better keep me on your side or I'll find you in the night
I got your name and your number and I'll set you all ablaze
Best give me what I want

Or I'll come for you
Yes, I'll come for you

If you reject me, I take what I want
Disrespect me and you get burned
Best keep me satisfied or you know I'll eat you alive
If you reject me, I take what I want

I got a ball and chain
And I'll hunt for you
I ain't got no name
I'll look out for you
Revenge, it ain't a sin
Look out, I'm comin' in
Kick me when I'm down, stand up without a sound
Better play my game

Or I'll bleed on you
Yes, I feed on you

If you reject me, I take what I want
Take what I want
Disrespect me and you get burned
No, I don't want your money or greed
You better give me just what I need
If you reject me
I take what I want
Hey, hey, take what I want

If you reject me, I take what I want
Disrespect me and you get burned
No, I don't want your money or greed
You better give me just what I need
If you reject me
I take what I want
Hey, hey, take what I want
Take what I want
Take what I want

// Shot In The Dark //

I need a pick-me-up, a rollin' thunder truck
I need a shot of you
That tattooed lady wild like a mountain ride
I got a hunger, that's the lovin' truth

You got a long night comin'
And a long night pumpin'
You got the right position
The heat of transmission

A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah, electric sparks
A shot in the dark beats a walk in the park, yeah

Blasting on the radio, breaking on the TV show
Send it out on all the wires
And if I didn't know any better, your mission is to party
'Til the broad daylight

You got a long night comin'
And a long night goin'
You got the right position
The heat of transmission

A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah, electric spark
A shot in the dark beats a walk in the park, yeah

My mission is to hit ignition

A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah, electric sparks
A shot in the dark beats a walk in the park, yeah
A shot in the dark
Ooh, a shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark beats a walk in the park, yeah

// Through The Mists Of Time //

See dark shadows
On the walls
See the pictures
Some hang, some fall
And the painted faces all in a line

And the painted ladies
Yeah, the painted ladies

Through the mists of time (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
The mists of time (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Of the restless kind (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Through the mists of time
On a magic ride
Through the mists of time (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)

Hear the whisper
Of the whirlwind
Monster shadows
A light gone dim
Dark horses
Roam in my sleep
Mystic voices
Conjure up our dreams

And the painted ladies
Yeah, the painted ladies

Through the mists of time (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
The mists of time (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Of the restless kind (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Through the mists of time
On a magic ride
Through the mists of time

(Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah)
And the painted faces (Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah)
Looking so divine (Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah)

Through the mists of time (Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah)
The mists of time (Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah)
Of the restless kind (Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah)
Through the mists of time (Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah)
On a magic ride (Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah)
Searching for a sign (Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah)
Through the mists of time (Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah)
The mists of time, time

// Kick You When You're Down //

As you're slipping down the wall
And you're headin' for a fall
As you're slipping down the wall

Why do they kick you when you're down?
Why do they kick you when you're down?

Hey, mama
Why are you beatin' on my head?
Hey, hey, woman
Why do you kick me outta bed?
I said

Is it something, is it something that I said?

(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
As you're slippin' down the wall
And you're headin' for a fall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
Why do they kick you when you're down?

Shady lady
You think that money grows on trees
Rotten apples by the barrel ain't a delicacy
And you see

Is this the way, the way it's meant to be?

(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
As you're slippin' down the wall
And you're headin' for a fall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
So down

And I don't need to say
To say it ain't a sacrifice

Is this the way, the way it's meant to be?

(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
As you're slippin' down the wall
And you're headin' for a fall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you?
Man, they're trying to trick you when you're down

// Witch's Spell //

Let me tell you your fortune
It could be sinister or maybe not
Like a leopard
Can't change its own spots

Ride a moon beam
Sail the starlight
A blaze in the night sky
See the witch's flight

Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

Good time maker who likes it hot
Like a card-playin' shark who takes the whole lot
(And that's a lot)

Ride a moonbeam
Sail the starlight
A blaze in the night sky
See the witch's flight

Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

It's all coming to ya
It's all coming through ya
I get bathed in the light
The spell's just right

Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

Crystal balls and an almanac
She gonna take you to hell and back
I've got potions, snake oil style
Good luck charms and a witch's spell

// Demon Fire //

He loves to drive 'em crazy
With his evil lips
Great guns are blazin'
On a deathly trip

Yeah, born of no family, born of no creed
Yeah, raised by a jackal, raised a bad seed
You better look around before you hit the ground
Give me no quarrel
Lives of crime

Like a devil on a deadline
Gonna send you down

Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows sapphire

Seeking out power, girl, I'll hunt you down
Boy, Lord of the Flies is gonna knock you out
You better look around
Hear the evil sound
Give me no quarrel, drenched in grime

With all the bad intentions
Gonna send you down

Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows sapphire
Demon fire, flames burn higher
Demon fire, it's an all-out hellfire

Hey!

Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows sapphire
Demon fire, flames burn higher
Demon fire, it's an all-out hellfire

Fire, demon, fire
Fire, demon, fire
Demon fire

// Wild Reputation //

In a one-horse town
They try to put you down
And make you feel out of place
Don't dare look in your face

Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Hey, hey
Ooh, yeah

On a hot summer day
Dollar bills come your way
Somebody robbed the bank
Ooh, they picked you outta the ranks
Hey

Get out of my way

// No Man's Land //

Come on noon
You gotta get on board

Come on, noon train
Come on, need to get out
I said, come on, noon train
Come on, don't you mess me about

You see
I've tried and I found no way to get out
I said, I tried and I found
There's no comin' back for me

(No man's land)
Know you gotta get away
(No man's land)
Fight and live another day

Caught in a hard rain
'Cause you know I need to get out
Hey, hey
Head out on the wide plain
Come on, don't you fool me around

You know I sought and I found
It's hard to get out
I said, I fought and I found
There's no comin' back for me

(No man's land)
Know you gotta get away
(No man's land)
Fight and live another day

In the middle of the fray

// Systems Down //

Unchained
Feel it burnin' up the heat
See the flames
Scorchin' everything it seeks

We got a chain reaction
It needs immediate action
This furnace is about to blast

Systems (Systems) are going down
Systems are burning out
And they all fall down

Untamed
Like a tiger searchin' feed
Ain't no game
As the earth shakes beneath your feet

We got a plan of action
Rising heat to the maximum
Who knows if this place implodes?

Systems (Systems) are going down
We got a chain reaction
Systems are burning out
And they all fall down

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey

This furnace is about to blast

Systems (Systems) are going down
Systems are burning out
And they all fall down
(Systems down)
Overload
(Systems down)
See the flames fly
(Systems down)
Systems goin' down
(Systems down)
Watch it burn to the ground

// Code Red //

Loading up the battery, raise enough insanity
Beating out the old-time blues
Crawling up the walls, sleeping on a waterfall
Melting off that dew

Strike one, strike two
Set your guns ablaze
Strike three, call emergency
You're gonna play it safe

Speeding up the road, tearing up the Highway Code
Ain't gonna slow me down
No need to hesitate, ain't comin' up late
And hit the brakes
Don't mess with fate

Hot fight, rough night
Dead in your sight
Fire light, fire bright
Fire in the night

Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Ooh, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red

Now pay attention

Reputation on your mind, enemy within your sight
Fire up, fire straight, fire free
Situation on your mind in the pale moonlight
Run quick, run silent, run deep

Hot fight, rough night
Dead in your sight
Fire light, oh fire bright
Fire in the night

Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Code, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red

Hey!

Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Code, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red

Hey, code red
Code red
Hey
