// Rock 'N' Roll Damnation //

They say that you play too loud
Well, baby, that's tough
They say that you've got too much
Can't get enough
They tell you that you look a fool
Or maybe I'm a fool for you
State that your mind's diseased
Shakey stuff

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whipping boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take your chance, while you still got the choice

You say that you want respect
Honey, for what?
For everything that you done for me
Well, uh, thanks a lot
Come on
Get up off your bended knees
You can set your mind at ease
My temperature's runnin' hot
Oh, I been waiting all night for a bite of what you got

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whipping boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance, while you still got the choice

Oh, it's a hard life
(Damnation) They're putting you down
(Damnation) All over town
(Damnation) 'Cause you're way out of reach
Livin' on the street, you got to practice what you preach

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whipping boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take your chance, while you still got the choice

(Damnation) You left a happy home
(Damnation) To live on your own
(Damnation) You want to live in sin
(Damnation) It's a rock 'n' roll
(Damnation) Just too fond of the joy
(Damnation) You're a toy for a boy
(Damnation) You got dollars in your eyes
(Damnation) Always chasing the pie in the sky
(Damnation)
Rock 'n' roll (damnation)

// Down Payment Blues //

I know that it's evil
I know that it's got to be
No, I ain't doing much
Doing nothing means a lot to me
Living on a shoestring
A fifty cent millionaire
Open to charity
Rock 'n' roller welfare

Sittin' in my Cadillac
Listenin' to my radio
Suzie, baby, get on in
Tell me where she want to go
I'm living in a nightmare
She's looking like a wet dream
I got myself a Cadillac
But I can't afford the gasoline

I got holes in my shoe
And I'm way overdue
Down payment blues

Get myself a steady job
Some responsibility
Can't even feed my cat
On social security
Hidin' from the rent man
Oh, it make me want to cry
Sheriff knockin' on my door
Ain't it funny how the time fly?

Sittin' on my sailin' boat
Sippin' on my champagne
Suzie, baby, all at sea
Say she want to come again
Feelin' like a paper cup
Floatin' down the storm drain
Got myself a sailin' boat
But I can't afford a drop of rain

I got holes in my shoes
And I'm way overdue
Down payment blues

Down payment blues
Down payment blues
Down payment blues

I got holes in my shoe
And I'm way overdue
I got the down payment blues

// Gimme A Bullet //

Ow!

She had the word, had the way
The way of letting me know
She knew the game, called the play
Oh, she hit me low
Said, "Now you go your way, I'll go mine"
And that's the start
Doctor, doctor, ain't no cure for the pain in my heart

Give me a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Give me a bullet to bite on, and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

Don't need no drink, don't need no drugs
Don't need no sympathy
Sooner or later, send me a bill for what she's doin' to me
Operator, long distance lips on the telephone
Come tomorrow, come to grips with being all alone

Give me a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Give me a bullet to bite on, and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

A bullet to bite on
Give me a bullet to bite on
Oh, yeah, come on, now
Yeah, yeah, gimme a bullet (bullet to bite on)
Oh, yeah, bullet to chew
I'll make believe it's you (bullet to bite on)
I'll make believe it's you
Give me a bullet to bite on
Oh, you're a bullet, baby
I want a bullet to bite on

// Riff Raff //

See it on television, every day
Ya hear it on the radio
It ain't humid, but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
A barmaid's tryin' to tell me (ha-ha)
"Beginning of the end"
Sayin' it'll bend me
Too late, my friend

Riff raff
Oh, it's good for a laugh
Ha-ha-ha
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
Smile a while

Now, I'm the kinda guy that keep his big mouth shut
It don't bother me
Somebody kickin' me when I'm up
Leave me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't even carry a gun
I ain't done nothin' wrong
I'm just having fun

Riff raff
Oh, it's good for a laugh
Ha-ha-ha
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
Smile a while

Do it again

// Sin City //

Diamonds and dust
Poor man last
Rich man first
Lamborghini's, caviar
Dry martini's, Shangri-La

I got a burnin' feelin'
Deep inside of me
It's a yearning
But I'm going to set it free

I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I wanna win
In sin city

Oh, let me roll you baby

Ladders and snakes
Ladders give
Snakes take
Rich man, poor man
Beggar man, thief
Ain't got a hope in hell
That's my belief
Fingers Freddy, Diamond Jim
They're gettin' ready
Look out, I'm comin' in

So spin that wheel
Cut that pack
And roll those loaded dice
Bring on the dancing girls and put the champagne on ice

I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I wanna win
In sin city

// What's Next To The Moon //

Well, I tied my baby to the railroad track
Cannonball down the line
Givin' that woman just a one more chance
Give it to me one more time
Engineer wishin' he was home in bed
Dreamin' 'bout Casey Jones
Wide-eyed woman, half a mile ahead
Thinkin' 'bout broken bones

It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love, gotta have
It's your love

Heavenly body flyin' 'cross the sky
Superman was outta town
Come on, honey, gotta change your tune
'Cause it's a long way down
Clark Kent lookin' for a free ride
Think about Lois Lane
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a suicide
And that'd be a shame

It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love, gotta have
It's your love

But what's next to the moon?

Long arm lookin' for a finger print
Tryna find a mystery clue
Hittin' me with the third degree
Workin' on the thumbscrew
Alright, officer, I confess
Everything's comin' back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack

It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love, gotta have
It's your love guaranteed

The love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love, gotta have
It's your love

What's next to the moon?

Movin' round the skies

Oh, baby, say "bye-bye"
You're right next to the moon
And on the moon
Oh, I've been around the moon

// Gone Shootin' //

Feel the pressure rise
Hear the whistle blow
Bought a ticket of her own accord
To, I don't know
Packed her heart in a travellin' bag
And never said, "bye-bye"
Something missin' in the neighborhood
Of her cryin' eyes

I stirred my coffee with the same spoon
Knew her favorite tune

Gone shootin'
My baby gone shootin'

Wrapped herself around
Like a second skin
Backed her favorite nag
But she could never win
I took an offer in another town
She took another pill
She was runnin' in an overdrive
A victim of overkill

She never made it past the bedroom door
What was she aiming for?

Gone shootin'
She's gone
Gone, gone, gone

Gone shootin'
My baby's gone shootin'
Look out, woo
(Gone shootin') How am I gonna get her down?
(Gone shootin') Ow, look out, look out, look out
(Gone shootin') I shouldn't get in her way
(Gone shootin') Ah, she sure is loaded
(Gone shootin') She's gone, gone, gone, gone, she's gone
(Gone shootin')

I used to love her so

// Up To My Neck In You //

Well I been up to my neck in trouble
Up to my neck in strife
Up to my neck in misery
For most of my life
I been a fool
And you know what a fool can do
I'm telling you

You come along when I needed you
Now I'm up
I'm up to my neck in you

And I been up to my neck in pleasure
Up to my neck in pain
I been up to my neck on the railroad track
Waitin' for the train
To cruise on through
Well I figured my time was due
Oh, it's way overdue

You come along and you pulled me through
Now I'm up
Up
Up to my neck in you

Don't it feel good?

Well, I been up to my neck in whiskey
I been up to my neck in wine
I been up to my neck in wishin'
That this neck wasn't mine
Oh, I'm a loser
(Who ain't lost it)
Baby, you were too good
Too good to be true

What you've done, no one else could do
Now I'm up
Oh, I'm up to my neck in you
Oh, that feels good

Yeah, you come along when I needed you
Oh
I'm up to my neck in you

// Cold Hearted Man //

No one knew where he came from
He never knew himself
Called her "Ma", called him "Pa"
But he was born to someone else
No one fooled or messed him 'round
'Cause they were all afraid
Ain't no lies
Ice in the eyes of Leroy Kincaid

Cold-hearted man
One time lover, heart in his hand
Cold-hearted man
And you can't trust nothin' you don't understand
Cold-hearted man
Cold-hearted man

Like a snake, he had no friends
He didn't need no one
Hurt his pride deep inside
He was another mother's son
Reputation, broken glass
Everybody prayed for their lives, on the street
Dare they happen to meet Leroy Kincaid

Cold-hearted man
One time lover, heart in his hand
Cold-hearted man (That's what he was)
And you can't trust nothin' you don't understand
Cold-hearted man
Cold-hearted man

Sometimes you can't see
The other side
It's too well hidden
For the naked eye
A one time lover
With his heart in his hand
Two time loser
A broken man

Cold-hearted man
One time lover, heart in his hand
Cold-hearted man
And you can't trust nothin' you don't understand
Cold-hearted man
Cold-hearted man

// Kicked In The Teeth //

Two face woman with your two face lies
I hope your two face livin' made you satisfied
Ya told me, baby, I was your only one
While you been runnin' 'round town with every mother's son
Hey

Two times, told about the women like you
Two times, told about the things you do
I used to think that you were sugar and spice
I shoulda listened to my ma's advice

Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain't this misery ever gonna end?
And I been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again

Two face woman, such a cryin' shame
Double or nothin', you all the same
You run around, hope you had your fun
You never know who's gonna win
'Till the race been

Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain't this misery ever gonna end?
And I been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again
