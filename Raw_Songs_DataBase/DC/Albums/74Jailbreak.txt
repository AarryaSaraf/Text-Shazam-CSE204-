Album: 74Jailbreak

// Jailbreak //

There was a friend of mine on murder
And the judge's gavel fell
Jury found him guilty
Gave him sixteen years in hell
He said "I ain't spending my life here
I ain't livin' alone
Ain't breakin' no rocks on the chain gang
I'm breakin' out and heading home"
Gonna make a (jailbreak)
And I'm looking towards the sky
I'm gonna make a (jailbreak)
Oh, how I wish that I could fly

All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
Got to be free

(Jailbreak), let me outta here
(Jailbreak), sixteen years
(Jailbreak), had more than I can take
(Jailbreak)

He said he'd seen his lady being fooled with
By another man
She was down and he was up
Had a gun in his hand
Bullets started flying everywhere
People start to scream
Big man lyin' on the ground
With a hole in his body
Where his life had been

But it was all in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
I got to be free

(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
I got to break out
Out of here

Heartbeats, they were racing
Freedom, he was chasin'
Spotlights, sirens
Rifles firing
But he made it out

...with a bullet in his back

Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak

// You Ain't Got A Hold On Me //

You can roll me 'round your finger
You can roll me if I'm blind
You can roll me, tally-ho-ho
I'm the easy rollin' kind
But don't think I'm facin' down hill
'Cause soon you'll see
You'll lose your grip and slip
'Cause you ain't got a hold on me

You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me
Why don't you let me be?
'Cause you ain't got a hold on me

You can take me to your bedroom
You can take me to your heart
You can take me to a climax
I won't fall apart
But don't count on me givin' it
All back to you
Just because I'm hooked on livin'
Doesn't mean I'm hooked on you

You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me
Why don't you let me be? No no
You ain't got a hold on me
Oh let me be

You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me
Why don't you just let me be?
'Cause you ain't got a hold on me

You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me

Hey you ain't got a hold on me
Ain't got a hold on me
Ain't got a hold on me
Ain't got a hold on me
Ain't got a hold on me

// Show Business //

You learn to sing
You learn to play
Why don't the businessmen ever learn to pay?

That's show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

You play in halls
You play in bars
You're climbin' walls
Chasin' stars

That's show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

You pay the man
You pay your dues
When it's all gone, oh
You sing the blues

Show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

You wanna roll
You wanna rock
But you find it hard
If your guitar's in hock

That's show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

You're smoking butts
They smoke cigars
You're drowned in debt
They drown in bars

That's show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

You pull a chick
Take her home
No use, man
You're worn out to the bone

That's show business (Show business)
Show business (Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

That's show business, show business
That's show business, show business, show business
That's the way it goes
Know what I mean

// Soul Stripper //

Well, I met her in the garden
Underneath that old apple tree
Sittin' with a handful of flowers
Lookin' as cool as can be
We talked away a couple of hours
Then she laid her hand on my lap
Oh, I thought, "I got to be dreaming"
I didn't know I fell in her trap

Then she made me say things I didn't want to say
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play

She was a soul stripper, she took my heart
She was a soul stripper, and tore me apart

She started movin' nice and easy
Slowly getting near to my spine
Killin' off each last little feeling
Ooh, every one she could find
And when she had me hollow and naked, yeah
That's when she put me down
Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me
Stuck it in and turned it around

Then she made me say things I didn't want to say
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play

She was a soul stripper, she took my heart
She was a soul stripper, and tore me apart

Soul stripper, soul stripper
Soul stripper, soul stripper
Soul stripper, soul stripper
Took out my heart
And tore it apart

Soul stripper, soul stripper
Soul stripper

// Baby, Please Don't Go //

Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please don't go

When the man done gone
When the man done gone
When the man done gone down the county farm
He got the shackles on
Baby please don't go
Don't leave me
I'll be a dog
I'll be a dog, woof
I'll be a dog kiss your way down here
When you walk along
Baby please don't go

Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please don't go

No baby please don't leave me
Why must you go away and do this to me baby
I want to suffer for you, suffer, suffer
Oh baby please don't go
No!
Baby, baby, baby, please don't go, please don't go
Don't go and leave me, please don't go
Baby, humm, baby, ah-uh
Oh don't go, no don't go
Ah don't go, don't go so slow
Oh don't go, no don't go
Why must you leave me lying on my back?
Going across other side of the track
Found yourself a new man, I know
So baby please don't go
Baby please don't go

No, no, no, no
Oh please, please don't leave me
I don't want to be left alone baby
Ah don't go, don't go, don't go
No!
