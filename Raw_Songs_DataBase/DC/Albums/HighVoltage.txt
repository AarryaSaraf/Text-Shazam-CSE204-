// It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'N' Roll) //

Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show
Stoppin' on the byways
Playin' rock 'n' roll

Gettin' robbed, gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up, broken boned
Getting had, getting took
I tell you folks, it's harder than it looks

It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doing one night stands
Try playing in a rock-roll band
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll

Hotel, motel
Make you want to cry
Ladies do the hard sell
Know the reason why

Gettin' old, gettin' gray
Gettin' ripped off, underpaid
Gettin' sold, second-hand
That's how it goes, playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out, it's rough and mean
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll

Well, it's a long way
Oh, it's a long way
(You should have told me)
It's a long way
Such a long way

// Rock 'N' Roll Singer //

My daddy was a-working nine-to-five
When my momma was a-havin' me
By the time I was half-alive
They knew what I was going to be
But I left school and grew my hair
They didn't understand
They wanted me to be respected as a doctor or a lawyer man

(But I had other plans)

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll
A rock 'n' roll star

Well, I worked real hard and bought myself
A rock 'n' roll guitar
I got to be on top someday
I wanna be a star
I can see my name in lights
And I can see the queue
I've got the devil in my blood
Telling me what to do

(And I'm all ears)

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll
A rock 'n' roll star

I hear it pays well

Well you can stick your nine-to-five livin'
And your collar and your tie
You can stick your moral standards
'Cause it's all a dirty lie
You can stick your golden handshake
And you can stick your silly rules
And all the other shit
That you teach to kids in school
'Cause I ain't no fool

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll
A rock 'n' roll star

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll
A rock 'n' roll star

Yes I are!

// The Jack //

She gave me the queen
She gave me the king
She was wheelin' and dealin'
Just doin' her thing

She was holdin' a pair
But I had to try
Her deuce was wild
But my ace was high

But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before?
Said she'd never had a full house
But I should have known

From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was her game
If she knew she could get you

She played 'em fast
And she played 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card

But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before?
Said she'd never had a royal flush
But I should have known

That all the cards were comin'
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealing out
I'd have dealt it back

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, and who knows what else
She's got the jack, yeah yeah
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
Hmm, it was a bad deal (jack)
She gave me the (jack) eh
She's got the (jack), she's got the (jack)
She's got the (jack), ooh, can you tell she's got the (jack)
(Jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack)
(She's got the jack, she's got the jack)

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, you'd never know but she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, it hurts (she's got the jack)
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack Ahh

(Boo!)
Thank you, thank you, thank you people, thank you
Thank you, I'm glad you liked the show
Yes, thank you very much folks
Good night and God bless

// Live Wire //

Well, if you're looking for trouble
I'm the man to see
If you're looking for satisfaction
I'm satisfaction guaranteed

I'm as cool as a body on ice
Hotter than the rolling dice
Send you to heaven
Take you to hell
I ain't fooling, can't you tell?

I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
Going to set this town on fire

And if you need some lovin'
And if you need some man
You've got the phone and the number
And I got no future plans

Oh, come on honey, you've got nothing to lose
You got the thirst 'n' I've got the booze
Give you an inch
Take you a mile
I want to make you fry

I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
Holy smoke and sweet desire

Like a hot rod, baby

Oh, stick this in your fuse box!

Ah, cooler than a body on ice
Hotter than the rolling dice
Wilder than a drunken fight
You're going to burn tonight

I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
And I'm gonna set this town on fire

Live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
Well, I'm your live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
Look at me burn
Ow, let me
Meltin'
Short my circuit
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

// T.N.T. //

Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!
Oi! Oi! Oi!

See me ride out of the sunset
On your color TV screen
Out for all that I can get
If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right

Ain't got no gun
Ain't got no knife
Don't you start no fight

'Cause I'm T.N.T., I'm dynamite
T.N.T., and I'll win the fight
T.N.T., I'm a power load
T.N.T., watch me explode

I'm dirty, mean, I'm mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand?

So lock up your daughter
Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
Run for your life
The man is back in town
So don't you mess me 'round

'Cause I'm T.N.T., I'm dynamite
T.N.T., and I'll win the fight
T.N.T., I'm a power load
T.N.T., watch me explode

T.N.T
Oi! Oi! Oi!
T.N.T
Oi! Oi! Oi!
T.N.T
Oi! Oi! Oi!
T.N.T
Oi! Oi! Oi!
T.N.T
Oi! Oi! Oi!

I'm dynamite
T.N.T
Oi! Oi! Oi!
And I'll win the fight
T.N.T
Oi! Oi! Oi!
I'm a power load
T.N.T., watch me explode!

// Can I Sit Next To You Girl //

Well, I met this girl for the first time Saturday night
Standing in the queue at the Odeon, alright

Oh, I took her by surprise
When I gave her one of my lines
She started smiling at me real fine, ha
And that's when I say

"Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you?"

Intermission, we were doing alright
'Till this guy came up and stood by her side

Oh, I took him by surprise
When I gave him one of my lines
She started smiling at me real fine
And that's when I said

"Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you, can I sit next to you girl?"

Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you? (Let me take you home)
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you? (Lick your ear)
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
C'mon, can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I sit next to you girl, can I sit next to you girl?
Can I?

// Little Lover //

Saw ya in the front row
Movin' to the beat
Just movin' and groovin'
Killed me when I saw
The wet patch on your seat
Was it Coca Cola?

Ooh baby, I hope you liked the show
When the band said goodnight
I had to say hello

Little lover, I can't get you off my mind, no
Little lover, I've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

Ooh baby, you sure looked sweet
Cruisin'
A leg either side of my motorcycle seat
Just oozin'

Could have been a nightmare
Could have been a dream
But on the way home, baby
I thought I heard you scream

Little lover, I can't get you off my mind
Little lover, ooh, I've tried so hard to find
Someone to give me the things that I need, ow!

Little lover, I can't get you off my mind, no
Little lover, I've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

You had my picture on your bedroom wall
Next to Gary Glitter, yeah
I was standing on the stage playing rock 'n' roll
I was a guitar picker, yeah

Never had a record
Never had a hit
Ooh baby, you didn't mind a bit

Little lover, I can't get you off my mind, no
Little lover, I've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

Baby I know you're a

Little lover
Ooh

To make a man out of me

Hands and knees all around the floor
No one has to tell her what a feller is for

But let me tell you all

The lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls

The lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls

// High Voltage //

Well, you ask me 'bout the clothes I wear
And you ask me why I grow my hair
And you ask me why I'm in a band
I dig doing one night stands
And you want to see me doin' my thing
All you got to do is plug me in to

High
I said, "High"

High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll

Well, you ask me why I like to dance
And you ask me why I like to sing
And you ask me why I like to play
I got to get my kicks some way
And you ask me what I'm all about
Come on, let me hear you shout

I said, "High"

High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll

All around the spotlight
Put the lights out, turn me on

Wine, women and song

Plugged in and turned on, it's sparkin' and
