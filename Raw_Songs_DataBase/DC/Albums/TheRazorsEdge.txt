Thunder, ah

I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

You've been – thunderstruck

Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

You've been – thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yow

Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said

Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine, so fine

Thunderstruck, yeah-yeah-yeah
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck

// Fire Your Guns //

Wild beast
I'll make you mine
Taste your kiss
Sweet lips divine
She got moves, drips of sweat
She got eyes of blue, body curves
And legs that'll break your nerves

Fire, when she's going down
Fire, then she make you drown
Fire, then she blow you 'round
Yeah, you want some fun?
Fire your guns, fire your guns, fire your guns, fire your guns

That lady bites
Hard style
Drips of sex
Eyes are wild
She got moves
Long long legs
She got eyes of blue, body curves
Legs that'll shake the earth

Fire, when she's going down
Fire, then she make you drown
Fire, then she blow you 'round
Yeah, you want some fun?
Fire your guns, fire your guns, fire your guns, fire your guns

Fire, when she's going down
Fire, then she make you drown
Fire, then she blow you 'round
Yeah, you want some fun?
Fire your guns, fire your guns, fire your guns, fire your guns
Fire your guns, fire your guns, fire your guns, fire your guns
Fire your guns
Fire your guns

// Moneytalks //

Yeah!

Tailored suits, chauffeured cars
Fine hotels and big cigars
Up for grabs, all for a price
Where the red hot girls keep on dancing through the night

The claim is on you, the sights are on me
So what do you do that's guaranteed?
Hey, little girl, you want it all
The furs, the diamonds, the paintings on the wall

Come on, come on, lovin' for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk

A French maid, foreign chef
A big house with king-size beds
You had enough, you ship them out
The dollar's up, down, you better buy the Pound

The claim is on you, the sights are on me
So what do you do that's guaranteed?
Hey, little girl, you break the laws
You hustle, you deal, you steal from us all

Come on, come on, lovin' for the money (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk

Moneytalks
Yeah-yow!

Moneytalks
B.S. walks
Moneytalks
Come on, come on

Come on, come on, lovin' for the money (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk (Moneytalks)

(Come on, come on, lovin' for the money) Moneytalks
(Come on, come on, listen to the money talk) Money talk, talk, talk
(Come on, come on, lovin' for the money) Oh, hear it talk
(Come on, come on, listen to the money talk) Yeah, yeah-yeah!
Money talk!

There's fighting on the left
And marching on the right
Don't look up in the sky
You're gonna die of fright

They're breathing down your neck
You're running out of lives

To raise the dead

On the razor's edge
That you'll be cut to shreds
Got a razor's edge
By the razor's edge

// Goodbye & Good Riddance To Bad Luck //

Gettin' bombed out on booze
Got nothing to lose
Run out of money
Disposable blues
Sleazy hotels
Like living in hell
The girl's on the hustle
With nothing to sell

Want something for nothing
It's always the same
Keep pushin' and shovin'
And I'm down on the game
Always in trouble
Forever detained

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Well, spread out the news
There's a free man loose
Back out of jail
And chasing some flooze
Bad luck has changed
Broken the chains
Laid out a claim
For monetary gains

Wantin' what's coming
All for the take
Freedom for lovin'
And lust for a taste
Eyes are wide open
Wild to the game

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck, yeah, yeah!

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Broken the chains of bad luck
Bye, bye, bye, bad luck
Throw down the gates of bad luck
Goodbye and good riddance
To bad luck

// If You Dare //

Honey, do you love me?
Love me like you do
Honey, won't you come outside and play?

If you dare
If you dare, yeah

Honey, do you love me?
Love me like you do
Woman, won't you come outside and play?

If you dare
If you dare

Woman, if you love me
Love me like you do
Love me like you say
Woman, won't you come outside and play?

If you dare
(Come on outside, come on outside
Come on outside and play)
If you dare

If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)
If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)
If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)
If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)

If you dare (come outside, come outside, come outside and play)
