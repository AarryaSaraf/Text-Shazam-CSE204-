// Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap //

If you're having trouble with the high school head
He's giving you the blues
You wanna graduate, but not in his bed
Here's what you gotta do:
Pick up the phone, I'm always home
Call me anytime

Just ring: 3-6, 2-4, 3-6, hey
I lead a life of crime

Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheep)
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap

You got problems in your life of love?
You got a broken heart?
He's double dealin' with your best friend
That's when the tear drops start, fella
Pick up the phone, I'm here alone
Or make a social call

Come right in, forget about him
We'll have ourselves a ball

Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheep)
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap (Aww)
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap

If you got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps naggin' at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts
Pick up the phone, leave her alone
It's time you made a stand

For a fee, I'm happy to be
Your back-door man

Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheep)
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap

Concrete shoes
Cyanide
TNT (Done dirt cheap)
Neck ties
Contracts
High voltage (Done dirt cheap)

(Dirty deeds) Do anything you want me to
(Done dirt cheap)
(Dirty deeds) dirty deeds
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)

Yaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrggghhhhhh!

// Love At First Feel //

You never told me where you came from
You never told me your name
I didn't know if you were legal tender
But I'd spend you just the same
And I didn't know it could happen to me
But I fell in love in the first degree

It was love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
First touch was too much, ow

They told me it was disgusting
Told me it was a sin
Oh, saw me knocking on your front door
Saw me smile when you let me in
You and me baby, we's all alone
Let's get something going
While your mom and dad ain't home

Love at first feel
It was love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Felt good just like I knew it would

(Love at first feel)
It was (love at first feel)
(Love at first feel)
It was (love at first feel)
(Love at first feel) Lightnin' bolts on my fingertips
Love at first feel (love at first feel)
Love (Love at first feel)
(Love at first feel)
(Love at first feel)

// Big Balls //

Well I'm rather upper class high society
God's gift to ballroom notoriety
And I always fill my ballroom
The event is never small
The social pages say I've got
The biggest balls of all

I've got big balls
I've got big balls
They're such big balls
And they're dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

And my balls are always bouncing
My ballroom always full
And everybody comes and comes again
If your name is on the guest list
No one can take you higher
Everybody says I've got
Great balls of fire

I've got big balls
Oh, I've got big balls
'N' they're such big balls
Dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

Some balls are held for charity
And some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure
They're the balls that I like best
My balls are always bouncing
To the left and to the right
It's my belief that my big balls
Should be held every night

We've got big balls
We've got big balls
We've got big balls
Dirty big balls
He's got big balls
She's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

(We've got big balls
We've got big balls)

And I'm just itching to tell you about them
Oh we had such wonderful fun
Seafood cocktail, crabs, crayfish
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

(Bollocks Knackers)
(Bollocks Knackers)
(Bollocks Knackers)

// Rocker //

I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a right-out-of-control-er
I'm a wheeler, I'm a dealer
I'm a wicked woman stealer
I'm a bruiser, I'm a cruiser
A rockin' rollin' man

Got slicked black hair, skin tight jeans
Cadillac car, and a teenage dream

I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rockin' rollin' man

Got Lurex socks, blue suede shoes
V8 car and tattoos

I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rockin' rollin' man
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rockin' rollin' man
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rockin' rollin', rockin' rollin' man, woo!

Wanna jive, honey?
Come on, spin you 'round, oh yeah
Yeah I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I'm a rocker, look at me roll!

// There's Gonna Be Some Rockin' //

Well me and the boys
Are out to have some fun
Gonna put on a show
Come on, let's go

There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight

Every night, there's a rock 'n' roll queen
Gonna quiver and quake
Gonna shake her thing

There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
It's a rock 'n' roll show

We got a big fat sound
Wanna share it round
Got a big bass drum
Gonna have some fun

There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight

Does that rock, or what?

There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight

// Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round To Be A Millionaire) //

The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty

Well, I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothing's gonna stop us, no, nothing
So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you've got the dollar, we've got the song
Just want to boogie-woogie all night long
Yeah, boogie

I got holes in my shoes
I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million

And I got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well, they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean

But I've got a Mamma who's a hummer
Just keeping me alive
While I'm in the band, doin' drinking with the boys
She's working 9-to-5
(She knows her place, that woman)

Just you wait
One of these days, see me driving 'round town
In my Rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sunroof down
My bottle of booze, no summer time blues
Shouting out, "Mom, look at me"
In my rock 'n' roll voice

No, it ain't no fun, yeah
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Do you believe me?
It ain't no fun, no
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
It ain't no fun, (I don't care what they say)
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Drive a Rolls Royce car
No it ain't no fun, and you know it
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, no, no, no , no, no, no
No, ain't no fun
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire

My million dollar scream
But it ain't no fun (ain't no fun) oh, no
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun), that's what I said!
Well, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun) and I wanna be rich
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Ain't no fun diggin' this ditch
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
You better believe me
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Well, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
I ain't havin' no fun (ain't no fun)
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire, no, no
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire

"Hey, hello Howard
What the hell are you doing, friend?
Next door neighbor
Oh yeah
Get your fucking jumbo jet outta my airport!"

// Squealer //

She said she'd never been, hummm
Never been touched before
She said she'd never been
This far before
She said she'd never liked
Mmm, to be excited
She said she always had
Had to fight it
(And she never won)

She said she'd never been
Never been balled before
And I don't think, hey
She'll ever ball no more
(Fixed her good)

Hey!

(Squealer) when I held her hand
(Squealer) I made her understand
(Squealer) when I kissed her lips
(Squealer) sucked her finger tips, hey
(Squealer) ooh started getting hot
(Squealer) ooh made it hard to stop
(Squealer) got too much
(Squealer) I think I've got the magic touch, aaah
(Squealer...)
