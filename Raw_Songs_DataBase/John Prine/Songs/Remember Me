The sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming
The sweetest days are the days that used to be
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said "Sweetheart, remember me."

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me.

You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours 'till the end of eternity
But all our vows are broken now and you will never
Be the same except in memory.

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me.

A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear, 
A sweeter smile, a love more bold and free. 
But in the end, fair weather friends may break your heart, dear. 
If they do, sweetheart, remember me.

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me.
Just to know you still remember me.
