Well I once knew a man who was going insane
He let love chase him right up a tree
It took the police and a fire truck
Just to bring him back down
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me

It made the front page of the paper
The gossip tongues wagged
Why they even showed it all on TV
Now if he should live forever
He won't live it down
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me

Dogs bites Man
Man loses girl
Oh what did he ever do
Wrong in this world?

Dogs bites Man
Man loses girl
Oh, what have I every done
Wrong in this world?

There once was a big buzz all over town
About a movie where the killer goes free
Now, he's got every one's sympathy
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me
Yes, I hate it when that happens to me
