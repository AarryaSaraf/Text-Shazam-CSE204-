Well, the moon is yellow and the people are too
They roll eggs on a bar-b-que
I was feeling kinda cocky with a head full of sake
Down in Chinatown

There was dragons flyin' kites high above the stores
Dead fish heads laying on the floor
I got a sideways hickey from a slant-eyed chickie
Down in Chinatown

And it was suddenly, was suddenly, whoa whoa
Yeah, suddenly Yeah, Suddenly whoa whoa

They smelled fish
We smelled like a meat
Sucking on a soda pop oh so sweet
Got a sugar rush that'd would make a nigger blush
Down in Chinatown

Won ton two ton three ton four
Smoke a cigarette throw it on the floor
I killed the pie-faced mothey with a shoeshine clothy
Down in Chinatown

It was suddenly, was suddenly, whoa whoa
Yeah, suddenly, Yeah, suddenly whoa whoa

The moonie is yellowie and the people are too
They roll eggs on a bar-b-que
I was feeling kinda cocky with head full of Saki
Down in Chinatown

I got a sideways hickey from a slant-eyed chickie
Down in Chinatown
Hey, down in Chinatown
Hey, down in Chinatown
