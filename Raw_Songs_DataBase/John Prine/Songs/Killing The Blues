Leaves were falling..Just like embers
In colors red and gold they set us on fire
Burning just like a moonbeam...in our eyes


Somebody said they saw me
Swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud.
Killing the Blues

I am guilty of something
I hope you never do because there is nothing
Sadder than losing.. yourself in love





Now, you ask me Just to leave you
To go out on my own and get what I need to
You want me to find..what I've already had
