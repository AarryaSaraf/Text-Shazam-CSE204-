You make me unlonely
I feel like the only
Person in the world
That ever had a girl like you

You make me feel wealthy
I almost look healthy
With you on my arm
Yeah together we could charm
This whole wide world

Once I was lonely
Nobody but me
My heart in a prison
Love set me free
God woke up
He heard my plea
He sent you to me
He sent you to me

You made me feel stronger
You made me love longer
Than anyone
Anyone in the whole wide world.
