I don't want to be the kind to hesitate
Be too shy, Wait to late
I don't care what they say other lovers do
I just want to dance with you
I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine,
So let it show, Let it shine
Oh, if we have change to make one heart of two
Then I just want to dance with you


I want to dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they invented dancing for,
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for,
I just want to dance with you

I caught you lookin' at me when I looked at you
Yes, I did, Ain't that true
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do
I just want to dance with you
Oh, the boys are playing softly and the girls are too
So am I, and so are you
If this was a movie then we're right on cue
I just want to dance with you






I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you
