If you wish upon a falling star
To figure out exactly who you are
That's alright by me, girl
That's alright by me

You've been gone about a week or so
Well, you'll be comin' home to me I know
Your love always sets me free, girl
That's alright by me

The wind the keeps blowin' the whole world upside down
The leaves are fallin' from the trees
The birds are flyin' the wrong way around
'Til you come back to me

The wind the keeps blowin' the whole world upside down
The leaves are fallin' from the trees
The birds are flyin' the wrong way around
'Til you come back to me

When mixed emotions hit a big brick wall
That don't matter much to me at all
We can solve this mystery, girl
That's alright by me

Your love always sets me free, girl
That's alright by me
