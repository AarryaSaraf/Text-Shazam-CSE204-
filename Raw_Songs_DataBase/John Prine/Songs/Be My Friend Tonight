I threw a party. Nobody came.
I bought all the tickets. They cancelled the game.
I give you my picture. It didn't fit your frame
Be my friend tonight

Be my friend tonight. Be my friend tonight.
I'll sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say it's right
Come on Honey, be my friend tonight

Now you bring the glasses and I'll bring the wine
I'll rub your shoulders just like they were mine
I won't make no passes till it's passing time
If you're only gonna be my buddy tonight

Be my friend tonight. Be my friend tonight.
I'll sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say it's right
Come on Darling, be my friend tonight

Well, I'll mind my manners. My P's and Q's
I won't give you nothing that you can't use
I'll whip out that old guitar and sing you the blues
Be my friend tonight

Be my friend tonight. Be my friend tonight.
I'll sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say it's right
Come on Honey, be my friend tonight
Be my friend tonight. Be my friend tonight.

I'll sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say it's right
Come on Darling, be my friend tonight
Oh, come on Honey, be my friend tonight
Please, be my friend tonight.
