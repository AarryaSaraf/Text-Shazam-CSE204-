That's my toaster over there
It was mine before we married
I bought it fair and square
And that's my purple Persian
Oriental polyester continental rug on the floor

Pots and pans and ugly dishes
One old dog and two goldfishes
Broken dreams, shattered wishes
A lucky horseshoe hanging above the door
What was that for?

Sweet memories, you and me
Dual custody

The oven roaster, your rocking chair
The walnut secretary, your wedding silverware
You only brought out on Thanksgiving
When Gramma was still living
Rest her soul, far to go

You only took the things you needed
Hanging plants and old bird feeders
A jug we used for margaritas
Back when things was mighty fine
Most all the time

Sweet memories, you and me
Dual custody, dual custody
These memories, you and me
Dual custody, dual custody

There's our photo of you and me
It was taken in Orlando in 1993
When we were holding hands and laughing
We were loving, we were living
Naturally, so happily

Now we only meet on Fridays
When you drop the kids at my place
You want yours and I want my space
And that's the one thing we agreed upon
Life goes on

Sweet memories of you and me
Dual custody, dual custody
Sweet memories of you and me
Dual custody, dual custody
All right
