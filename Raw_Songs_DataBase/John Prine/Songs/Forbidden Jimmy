Forbidden Jimmy
Has got a mighty sore tooth
From biting too many dimes
In a telephone booth
He's got half of his bootlace
Tied to the dial
Thank you operator
For getting Jimmy to smile

"Call out the Coast Guard"
Screamed the Police
Forbidden Jimmy
He's got three water skis
He put two on his wavelength
And gave one to his girl
She's a mighty fine person
It's a mighty fine world


I'm gonna make all your sorrows bright
Set your soul free
I'll see you tomorrow night
If I can still see

Ginger Caputo
And Dorian Gray
Oughtta stay out of pictures
If they got nothin' to say
Stack 'em back on the rack Jack
Ya know, you're hurting my eye
Forbidden Jimmy
He's getting ready to fly



I got caught cooking popcorn
And calling it hail
They wanna stick my head
Inside a water pail
Ya know, they're gonna be sorry
They're gonna pay for it too
Forbidden Jimmy
He's coming straight at you
