A man came to our house
I believe it was yesterday
I would have invited him in
But I didn't have a lot to say

His anticipation of me opening the door
Outweighed my apprehension as it never had before
And drove my concentration
Right through that hardwood floor

I'm taking a walk
I'm going outside
I'm taking a walk
I'm just getting by

There's a girl in the white house
I don't even know her name
Her disheveled appearance
Speaks volumes of shame

It's an embarrassing situation
But a situation just the same
The way she walks on others
And never takes the blame
Upsets my constitution
Beyond its mortal frame

Oo-oo a-ha

I'm taking a walk
I'm going outside
I'm watching the birds
I'm just getting by

Found a card in the pocket
Of my worn out overalls
From a girl in Cedar Rapids
Now residing in Idaho Falls

I wish you could have been there
When she opened up the door
And looked me in the face
Like she never did before
I felt about as welcome
As a Wal-Mart Superstore

0o-oo - a-ha

I'm taking a walk
I'm going outside
I'm taking a walk
I don't need a ride

I'm watching the birds
Flying so high
