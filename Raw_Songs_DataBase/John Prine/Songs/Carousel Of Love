I'm going down to ride the merry-go-round in the middle of a bad storm
I feel a little forlorn, your man blows a mean horn
I think my baby's stuck on a rollercoaster looking for a sad song
I'm trying to get her back on the track of the carousel of love

If I could only go back in time to at least last Tuesday
Then there wouldn't be a blues day, or maybe April Fool's Day
I'd buy her flowers and and I'd tell her tomorrow might be a better news day
And take her hand and ride on the carousel of love

If our love is gonna last then you know it's gonna have to go the long way
There's a hundred million wrong ways, trying to find the strong way
But if you'll take my hand, I'll always be your man and go the right way
Down the highway that leads to the carousel of love
Down the highway that leads to the carousel of love
