Don't be ashamed of your age.
Don't let the years get you down.
That old gang you knew, they still think of you
As a rounder in your old hometown.

Don't mind the grey in your hair.
Just think of all the fun you've had puttin' it there.
As for that old book of time, you've never skipped a page.
So don't be ashamed of your age, brother.
Don't be ashamed of your age.

Listen, Mr. Smith, Mr. Brown,
Don't let your age get you down.
Life ain't begun until you're 40, son.
That's when you really start to go to town.

Don't wish that you were a lad.
Why, boy, you've lost more gals than they've ever had.
And, listen, you've graduated from that ol' sucker stage,
So don't be ashamed of your age, brother.
Don't be ashamed of your age.
