I saw a man today who said he talked to you
Not so long ago I think a month or two
As my mind raced back in time
I prayed oh Lord don't let it show
He thinks I forgot you fifteen years ago

Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or go
It takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know I've tried since fifteen years ago

I've got a lovely wife who thinks the world of me
Promised her my love through all eternity
I've tried hard to make her happy but so far she doesn't know
I can't shake this thing from fifteen years ago

Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or go
It takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know I've tried since fifteen years ago
It takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know I've tried since fifteen years ago
