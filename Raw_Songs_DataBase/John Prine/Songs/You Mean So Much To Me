A girl meets a guy
A car passes by
The moon shines down on a tree
A kid in the park
Should have been home by dark
You mean so much to me
The snow on the ground
A merry-go-round
A sight that was somethin' to see
Some cigarette smoke
Some laughter a joke
You mean so much to me
It seems to be
Like heaven to me
With you at the end of the day
Here's looking at you
Here's looking at me
Dancing with history
That old crocodile
Got a satisfied smile
His life is no big mystery
A postcard you wrote
A musical note
You mean so much to me
Here's looking at you
Here's looking at you
Here's looking at me
Dancing with history
It seems to be
Like heaven to me

With you at the end of the day
A girl meets a guy
A car passes by
The moon shines down on a tree
I'm thinking of you
So what else is new
You mean so much to me
You mean so much to me
