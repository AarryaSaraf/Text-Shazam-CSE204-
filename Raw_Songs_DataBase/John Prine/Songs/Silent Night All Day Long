There's a pine tree in a window in a house on a hill
With a tree top angel sitting perfectly still
She's watching the shoppers walk through the snow
With their arms full of treasures and hearts all aglow


We held hands and stared at the lights on the tree
As if Christmas was invented for you and for me
When the angel on the treetop requested a song
We sang Silent Night All Day Long

There's a family that's gathered in some living room
Dinner on the table that's been cooking since noon
Stockings on the mantle are hanging with care
While every body is saying a prayer



There's a room out there somewhere with a woman in a chair
With memories of childhood still lingering there.
How pretty the paper, the lights and the snow.
How precious those memories of long long ago.



When the angel on the treetop requested a song.
We sang Silent Night all day long
