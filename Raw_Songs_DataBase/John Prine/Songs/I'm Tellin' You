I'm tellin' you, you'd better change your way
I am tired of being lonely night and day
While around the town you chase
There'll be someone in your place
If you don't stop your cheatin'
I'm a-tellin' you

I'm getting wise, so honey, take a tip from me
I am not the foolish soul I used to be
If you think you're treatin' me wrong
You'll come home and I'll be gone
If you don't straighten out
I'm a-tellin' you

The road is long that never takes a turn
And the heart is hard that has no chance to yearn
I love you much too much
Oh, you big old such and such
Now you better straighten out
I'm a-tellin' you

Now you better straighten out
I'm a-tellin' you
