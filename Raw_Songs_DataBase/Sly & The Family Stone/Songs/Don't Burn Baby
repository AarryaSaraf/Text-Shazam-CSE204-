I can understand frustration
Joined by agitation
Creates aggravation
Led by a congregation

But don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby, learn
Don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby

I can understand confusion
Creates bad illusion
Sometime the wrong one losin'
Everybody abusin'

But don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby, learn
Don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby, baby

Don't burn, baby, burn
You got to learn, baby, learn
So that you can earn, baby, earn
Get a little something called yearn, baby, yearn

You'd be sittin' around like the underdog
One of these days
Talkin about dearn, baby, dearn
So get yourself together and get together

I want to see you churn, baby, churn
I want to see you churn, baby, churn
I want to see you churn, baby, churn
Hey, hey

Everybody station to station
Help your part of the nation
Understand the proclamation
Retake the emancipation

But don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby, learn
Don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby, baby
