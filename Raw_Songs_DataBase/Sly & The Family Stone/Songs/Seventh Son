Everybody's talkin' about the seventh son
In the whole wide world, there is only one

And I'm the one, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the one, there you go
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one they call the seventh son

I can tell your future, it will come to pass
I can say things to you, make your heart beat fast
Look in the sky, predict the rain
I can tell when a woman got another man

I'm the one, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one they call the seventh son

I can say things to you, make it sound so sweet
I can even make your little heart skip a beat
Heal the sick, raise the dead
I can make the little girls talk out of their head

And I'm the one, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one they call the seventh, yeah
