I know, I know you need attention
I got, I got attention for you
I know, I know you need affection
I got, I got affection for you

If somebody told me (I knew you like )
I think I will  to you
And if I find out (I knew you like diamonds)
I buy diamonds and emeralds and rubins and things (got those for you too)

I'm on a trip to your heart
I'm on a trip to your heart
I'm on a trip to your heart
I'm on a trip to your heart

If  you like silence
I make everything stand still
something might surprise you
but that's, that's how I feel

If  I find out that (you need eternity)
I love you forever and ever and ever (love has no end)
And if I find you didn't wanna be bugged no more (you wanted to be alone)
I promise I will Let hang  on (if I see you again)

I'm on a trip to your heart
I'm on a trip to your heart
I'm on a trip to your heart
I'm on a trip to your heart

If  you like silence
I make everything stand still
something might surprise you
but that's, that's how I feel

And if you need  (you need eternity)
My love is forever and ever (love has no end)
And if I find you didn't wanna be bugged no more (you wanted to be alone)
I will never  me at all 'cause I still love you (don't see you again)

I'm on a trip to your heart
I'm on a trip to your heart
I'm on a trip to your heart
I'm on a trip to your heart
