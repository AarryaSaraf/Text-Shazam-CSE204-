I was out
Skippin' stones
In the end it's what you know
Found my feet
They were firm
What you leave is what you burn
Won't find me
In the second verse
Never found me in the first

Away
Does it bound and break
And you look so vain

Broke my heart
Broke my will
It was all so much to fill
Every turn
Every road
It would all lead back to you
Feel my words
Running out
How we end we're livin' down

Away
And I have a say
And it's not too late

Show me something beautiful 
Show me something beautiful 
Show me something beautiful

I was out 
In the dust
Kickin' weeds out from the trucks
I was old
You were young 
Who believe it ever come

Away
My hands can take
The trucks and breaks
But there's nothing left of me

Show me something beautiful 
Show me something beautiful 
Show me something beautiful
