In the hours that I've known
And of all of my woes
Are the cause to lay you low
I demand they turn to whole

Would you set me free
Just set me free

As it takes its hold
And it won't let you go
I'm reminded of the cold
And how it's taken so much from me
Are you worthy of being saved?
All your fears and insecurities

Just set me free
Just set me free
Just set me free

And there's nowhere to hide
And you're only just trying
Are there only just lies you hear?
While redemption seems far away
While I stumble through every day

Just set me free
Just set me free
Just set me free
Just set me free

Just set me free
Keep running till we learn to find peace

Just set me free
Keep running till we learn to find peace

Just set me free
Keep running till we learn to find peace

Just set me free
Keep running till we learn to find peace

Just set me free
