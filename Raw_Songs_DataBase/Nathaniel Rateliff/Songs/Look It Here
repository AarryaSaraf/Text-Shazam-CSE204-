Look it here baby I'm coming out
On my knees begging please yeah
Look it here baby I'm calling out
Crying now hear me plead yeah

Look it here baby I'm lucky now
When I weep let me be
Look it here baby it's all I got
One more time hear me out yeah

I got a love so hard I can't stand it
And with a heart so weak and abandoned
You'll have to bury this man
And if that's what it takes for a love that must be proved

Look it here baby I'm coming out
On my knees begging please yeah
Look it here baby I'm coming out
On my knees begging please yeah
Look it here baby there's no one else
Come on now hear me out

Look it here baby I'm coming out
Look it here baby I'm coming out
Look it here baby I'm coming out
Look it here baby I'm coming out
Look it here baby I'm coming out
Look it here baby I'm coming out
