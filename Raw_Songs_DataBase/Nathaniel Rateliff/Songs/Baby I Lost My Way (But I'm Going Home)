Now the weight I know and the weight I've seen
You look tired and worn, you were almost beat
Now the weight I found
Baby I lost my way but I'm going home

I've been stumbling down the mountain
I've been stumbling by the sea
I've been stumbling in the dust
I can't taste it on my teeth
But the weight I know
Baby I lost my way but I'm going home

Been pushing through a crowd on an empty street
Everything that you worked for but still can't see
Baby take it from someone who knows, I'm trying hard just to get back home
Only thing honey that I need is your arms around me

Now the love I found how it weighs on me
Are you tired and worn or maybe I can't see
Baby don't let go
Baby I lost my way but I'm going home
