Carry on
Whatever I need, yeah
And though it seems
Won't be tried
What if I am
Alone again?

It's been a long time and I get so paralyzed
Well, me and my loneliness will hide
Only long for what I see
Yeah, only my heart can find my feet

It's a heartbeat
It's a hard soul
Heartbeat
It's a hard soul
It's what I need to hold
It's what I need to hold

One more try
All that I did, I did
With my back, I did
Just another hour and I'll get to run
When I'm untied, you know I'll run
I know there's a fear
And only

It's a heartbeat
It's a hard soul
Heartbeat
It's a hard soul
It's what I need to hold
It's what I need to hold

It's what I need
It's what I need, baby
It's what I need
It's what I need, baby
It's what I need
It's what I need, baby
It's what I need
It's what I need, baby
It's what I need
