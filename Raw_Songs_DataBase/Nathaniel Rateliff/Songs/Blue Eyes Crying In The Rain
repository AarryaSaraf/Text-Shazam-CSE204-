In the twilight glow, I see
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dyin' ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages, I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain
