What makes you sad, what makes you blue?
I'm all in rags with nothing to lose
We could traverse and find a way through
Land in the grass and start acting like fools

You're a prisoner by day
Is that what you choose?
Stand in the water, baby
It'll get you through tonight

Who did you razz, who starts the coup?
You went on a fast with no weight to lose
You said you were laying off of the booze
You came over drunk to lay on the truth

You're a prisoner by day
Expecting to lose
Stand in the water, baby
It'll get you through tonight

You came in the front to sneak back in the room
With all of your friends and all attitude
Went into a lunge while playing it cool
You said come here close and I'll lay on the truth
You're a prisoner by day
Expecting to lose
Stand in the water, baby
It will get you through tonight

You're a prisoner by day
Is that what you choose?
Stand in the water, baby
It will get you through tonight
