It careened and crashed while the other waved
And you waited in the sun so long that when you only wanted shade
Let the old men laugh, let the old men say
That I've never done nothing that wasn't out of love, baby
Now the weight that you carry seems such a heavy load while you're

Face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go

Remember standing in the light
Remember crawling all the way
You paraded in the nighttime for a clean getaway
You were standing in the water, but only up to your knees
But you know a strong current could always sweep you off your feet
You were waiting for the right time
But can it take so long while you're

Face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go

You were flowing blind
When they stole your name
You were planning a way out
When you lost your way
Bent to a hunch now
Like a broke-down show
Face down in the moment just a-waiting to let go

Face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go

Keep waiting
Keep waiting
Keep waiting

You keep waiting on the night
You keep waiting on your pain
Every moment that you wait now is a moment slipped away
I think you're gonna have to come out and face all the fear you can't explain
All your life, you've been face down and now it's time for you to see
All your life, you've been face down and now it's time for you to see
All your life, you've been face down and now it's time for you to see

See it
See it
See it
See it

Face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go
