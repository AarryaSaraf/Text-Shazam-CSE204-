I was a brakeman
The sharpest of all them
Hoping to be there in it good

I was a bum rush
And pardon the self lust
It wasn't always understood

I was comb man
I comb every short line
I wanted to damage just a few

Hoping in time it won't be swift enough
And they'll carry us away
And they'll carry us away

I was a cold one
Colder than ever
You feel the chill I left on you

Now back on the brake lines
Steeper than I climbed
Well if there's one will it be you?

Take your ride, and take your fall
And laying your trap for me

Take this wig above my head
It did what it had to do

It runs back to straight and true
And leaving no more..
