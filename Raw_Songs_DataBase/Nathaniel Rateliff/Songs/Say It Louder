One of these days I'm gonna take mine back
I fell forever just to watch the slack
All of the days of working in the sun
My hands remind me of every hole I dug

I said, hey, I'm all cried out
Hey, I'm all tired out
You'll climb out when you're finding your own way

Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Sometimes what you need is exactly what you fear

One of these days I'll take it on my way
One of these nights I'll leave it somewhere baby
Talk of days and nights and what you want
You say forever there's way too long

Hey, hey baby
The nights turned to dawn and we're standing
In the shadows baby where we turn to face the sun

Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear

Hey, I'm all cried out
Hey, I'm all tired out
You'll climb out when you finding your own way

Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Sometimes what you need is exactly what you fear
