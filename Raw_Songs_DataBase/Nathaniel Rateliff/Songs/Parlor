Last night in at the parlor
And I ain't other boys in the band
While I stood there in the corner
And I wait for a feeling to dance
Every woman and their baby
Better call them all if you can
 and them swinging
Than to be there slapping your hands

I said hey man, holler
Twist in the parlor
Move those feet if you can
Don't be standing in the corner
And I wait for the feeling to dance
I said "Aaahhh"

Last night in a parlor
I was only taking 
But I held myself together
While the ache was  taking me down

I said hey man, holler
Twist in the parlor
Move those feet if you can
Don't be standing in the corner
And wait for the feeling to dance

It was late night in the parlor
Well we made 
Don't you ache
Don't you want it
I'll twist and shake it again

I said hey man, holler
Twist in the parlor
Move those feet if you can
Don't just stand in the corner
And wait for the feeling to dance
I said "Aaahhh"
