I hoped it would heal
Or you'd wake when it was over
Now counting the days
Since your breath had closed your eyes

Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on
And now you sleep forever
Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on

How easy you left
Remembering all your laughter
But deep in your chest
Was a moan that never ends

Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on
If I find you, I will wake you
Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on

I'd hoped like a prayer
That your brokenness would leave you
But months turned to years
And the emptiness prevailed

Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on

All the love and cries could not shake you from your rest
Would've given up my sight to take the jaundice from your skin

Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on
And now you sleep forever
Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on
