I'll come back to you as a strong will tower to devour
Any sense you make but since you don't

You'll arrive and you
You think you're clever while it's severed
You just fill the air with words you know

I got all this and nothing too
I'd carry you anywhere you want me to go
You'd think I'd notice, but I never do
Sometimes you're just too tired to make it home

Too much time spent alone trying to pull yourself under
Is that thunder or the sense that someone calls your name

I want back from you all the hours that I cowered
While you corrected everything I'd say

You really found me out, so you used to think
Too much pain and doubt in one little space

I got all this and nothing too
I'd carry you anywhere you want me to go
You think I'd notice, but I never do
Sometimes you're just too tired to make it home

Don't come back and please don't lie to me
Don't say it's all or nothing, baby
Don't come back and please don't lie to me
Don't say it's all or nothing, baby

Don't come back and please don't lie to me
Please don't say it's all or nothing, baby
