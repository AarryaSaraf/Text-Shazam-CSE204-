Gotta dig a lot of holes to get into something deep
Gotta sing a lot of soul to know how to feel it

You still feel alone
Well, at least it's your own
And I hope that you know
That I'm just calling out singing

Part of me that loves the life
Part of me that loves the ride
Each time I'm alone, I just try to calm myself down

Part of me that knows that something ain't right
Part of me that knows I can't even see it

Part of me feels I've arrived
But sometimes, it don't align
Each time it begins to rhyme
I just feel so surprised that I talk to myself sometimes at night
When I can't sleep
Let my mind wander
It keeps wandering back to me

Part of me that loves the life
Part of me that loves the ride
These scenes will play out in time
It's tangled up in all the lines that you wrote for yourself, baby

Gotta dig a lot of holes to get into something deep
Some of the folks you know, they can't even see it

Part of me that loves the life
Part of me that loves the ride
These scenes will play out in time
It's tangled up in all the lines that you wrote for yourself, babe
It's like throwing notes down a well, babe, and still being so surprised

Part of me that knows that something ain't right
Part of me that knows that something ain't right
Part of me that knows that something ain't right
Part of me that knows that something ain't right
