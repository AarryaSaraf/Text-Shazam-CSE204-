What if I can never discover?
What if I'm just taking too long?
Or I'm wrong, my vision is cluttered, I'm stumbling on
What if I just quit tomorrow?
What if I just tuck and run?
If there ain't no line to follow, well, how will you know?

What if I can't wait any longer?
But I'm scared of lettin' it show
And of all this piled together, the least is the most

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe the nights are sharp and cold
Maybe it's harder to see when you cannot believe
When only half of the cards are shown
Ah, maybe as time goes on together, we'll learn how to grow

What if I can't take the heartache?
What if I don't want to know?
What if all I found was darkness leading to none?
Well, come on, just leave the light on
Give me air and clear the room
'Cause if I don't find an answer, I fear I will fold

What if I can't wait any longer?
But I'm scared of lettin' it show
And of all these piled together, the least is the most

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe the nights are sharp and cold
Ah, maybe it's harder to see when you cannot believe
When only half of the cards are shown
Ah, maybe as time goes on together, we'll learn how to grow

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it
Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it
Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it
Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
