Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
Well I don't care. darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

I said hold on tight to me
Darlin', as we spin around
It's hard to see one's feet
And the direction in where they're bound

So baby, hold my hand
Better to move than stand
Sometimes you only have right now

Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

I can't even hide it
Are you judging by the weight of the wind?
Pulled from every side but
Tonight we'll be something that we've never been

Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

Now somewhere at the center of me
And somewhere at the heart of you
I know I want to be saved
You said you wanted to
So come on home with me
And the rest of us be
Just the softness upon your skin

Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

Let's hold a little while then
Let go of the pain and all the fear
Touch me when you are smiling
Sun will be rising and all will be clear

I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
Oh, I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

No, I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
Oh, I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

Oh, l I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
