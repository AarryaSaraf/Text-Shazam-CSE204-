Oh nah baby don't you do it wrong
I did it (I did it)
If I crack don't let it keep it going
I did it (I did it)
Break my back work my own
If I lie don't do me wrong
I did it (I did it)

Come on baby don't you make me wake but
I did it (I did it)
If I fall I feel so weak
I did it (I did it)
Break my back say my name
Don't be crash don't be claim
Oh now baby why won't you shake and scream
I did it (I did it)

She said maybe your just lazy
Not even trying I'm doing like I want you to
I did it (I did it)

Come on baby I know your lazy
Not afraid but you can't turn out like I want you to

I did it (I did it)
