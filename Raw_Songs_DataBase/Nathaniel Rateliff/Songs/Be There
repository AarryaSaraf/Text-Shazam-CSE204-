You start looking mean you need something to ruin
Carved out your name, not enough for you
I remember when there was nothing to take your mind off it
I know all the ways to act like a fool
I needed you

In other words, other ways
I want you to be there for me
In other words, other ways
I want you to be there for me

You think that you can, I take up so much room
It's the best I can bend to try and make some space for two
It spins around us in a direction to come unwind
While I needed you it was never a choice of mine

In other words, other ways
I want you to be there for me
In other words, other ways
I want you to be there for me

Ain't it hard enough for me to ask
It takes all of me

In other words, in other ways
I want you to be there for me
In other words, other ways
I want you to be there for me
In other words, in other ways
I want you to be there for me
