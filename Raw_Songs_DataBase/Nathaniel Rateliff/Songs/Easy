Think that you walk in two strides in front of
While everyone else just stand
Youalways pick the right best fruit
And it always rots in your hands
But did you dig through the nest
'Cause the cold man's honey
The sting has got stuck in your head
We could tweeze it them out
Let the swelling go down
But it's probably too late for that

It was mocking every single known
It was filling the space that we left
We don't have to be too bright to see
That it's too cold here to dance
I want it easy, I want it easy
I want it easy, I want it easy

Why don't you draw me a map to nowhere
Well if you know as much as you said
Maybe your talk it ain't that funny
Like the time your burned off all your hair
Or you can hear from the skies
And if it still leaves your mire
Well at least you're an honest man
Well at least you've got something left
I want it easy, I want it easy
I want it easy, I want it easy

I wanna be a marvelous time and
And all my time is spent on
Someone who cannot tell you
And I almost forgot myself
And all in hand, and all it is
It's colliding, nothing else
I want it easy, I want it easy
I want it easy, I want it easy
