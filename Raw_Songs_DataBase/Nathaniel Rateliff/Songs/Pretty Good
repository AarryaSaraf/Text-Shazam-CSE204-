Well I got a friend in Freemont
Sells used cars, you know
Well he called me up
Twice a year
Just to ask me how it go
Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
But actually everything is just about the same
I met a girl from Venus
Her insides are lined in gold
Well she did what she did
Asked how is the kid?

Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
But actually everything is just about the same
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
This boy's ever seen

Mommy went to Arkansas
She got raped by 
Well she was doing good until she
Went in the woods and got pinned up against the log

Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
Cause actually
All those dogs are about the same
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
This boy's ever seen

I heard Allah and Buddha
Singing it to save his feast
And up in the sky
An Arabian rabbi
Made Quaker oats to a priest

Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
Cause actually
All them gods are about the same
Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
Cause actually
Everything is just about the same
