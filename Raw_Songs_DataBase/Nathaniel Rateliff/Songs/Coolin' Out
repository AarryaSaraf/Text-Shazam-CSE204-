I've been coolin' out baby
Now I might be fool enough maybe
And now I want to hear you say it
Say that love ain't enough to carry
Now it might be that I'm being swayed in a lie

Are you standing in the shadows or standing in the waves
The heat's got you dizzy and you're red in the face
Warm summer breeze but it's cold at my place
I feel the rhythm and you're on the chase

I said baby, come on
We'll be dancing and having fun
Tell your mama that you're leaving home
And your friends are gonna come along

And I've been coolin' out baby
And I want to hear you say it
Baby it's not broke not mending
And you can't always catch it baby
Buy me a hook
Sing me a song
Find me crooked broken and wrong
I found myself in the way...

I said baby, come on
We'll be dancing and having fun
Tell your mama that you're leaving home
And your friends are gonna come along
We'll be coolin' and carrying on

I've been coolin' out baby...
