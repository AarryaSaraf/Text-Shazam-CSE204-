Come in late at night when I'm alone
You want what's right, but you tell me all the time
That I only seem to do it wrong

Baby, I've got your number
I'll call you when I get home
Now I've got your number, baby
I'll never leave you alone

He can't jump a hurdle and I can't run
He came by in the middle of the night
To tell me that I was wrong

Baby, I've got your number
I'll call you when I get home
Now I've got your number, baby
I'll never leave you alone

Maybe when things are right and I feel strong
I'll move on to try the things that I find
Only realizing that I'm wrong

Baby, I've got your number
I'll call you when I get home
Now I've got your number, baby
I'll never leave you alone

Now I've got your number, baby
I'll never leave you alone
Now I've got your number, baby
I'll never leave you alone
