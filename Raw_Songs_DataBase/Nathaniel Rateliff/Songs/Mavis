In other worlds
In other worlds I would be with you
And other nights
And other nights I think I've seen you
Caught on a way
Caught on a way I do not own you

And you relax
Knowing the way I do
I'd do for you

All that I've seen through
I do it for you
All again

In other times
You said your feet move so fast you couldn't see
Gone are the days
When you could start ahead and outrun me
And all the lights
And all the lights you say they're heavy now

I recall a time, you were mine
And all the time you bared your teeth
It was always just a smile for me

I recall a time, you were mine
And all the time you bared your teeth
It was always just a smile for me
