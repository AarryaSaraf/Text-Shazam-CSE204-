Is the future open?
Is the future seen?
You'd have to pray forever and if you don't believe
They'll come down on you
From the longest fall

When they've all been vanquished and they've all been tried
Like it's some great penalty, but it's just their pride
And they got no follow-through
They hold the weakest stance

Yeah, well, they'll come to steal and divide
All that's good

You say you thirst for vengeance and you crave for fire
On the roofs of innocence
You watch them rage and writhe
And it don't bother you
You feel so brave

You're standing in the water
You think that you've been saved
With your blind ignorance
In comes a crushing wave
Now see what drown men do in your watery grave

Well, they'll come to steal and divide
All that's good
Yeah, they'll come to steal and divide
All that's good

Yeah, they'll come to steal and divide
Yeah, they come to steal and divide
All that's good
All that's good
