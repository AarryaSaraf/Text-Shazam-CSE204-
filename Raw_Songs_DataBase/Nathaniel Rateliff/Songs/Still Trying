When I wake up in the morning, I'm gonna tell
I was standing looking backwards in the outs
You said there's room enough to cramping in the crowd
No movement here no friends to break us out
Stop breathing or we'll just swim fast

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know a goddamn thing

In these moments I forget to tell myself
And if you're rolling in it long enough, your shit won't even smell
Is there no one I can trust to point it out
Well I can hardly be right here, I was spitting on myself
When I wake up in the morning I'm gonna tell

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know a goddamn thing

This wound is gonna cancel me out 
This wound is gonna cancel me out 
This wound is gonna cancel me out 
This wound is gonna cancel me out 


Ooh ooh I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know a goddamn thing
