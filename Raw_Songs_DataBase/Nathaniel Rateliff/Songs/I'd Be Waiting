If I go home oh with a howlin' bend
If you ever get lonely if you never did
I count the hours you come round again

I'm just saying hmm hmm baby
I'd be waiting ah baby
I'd be waiting ah baby just to dance with you

If all this seems like I carry my head so low
If I don't sing I'd be waiting on call from home
My moan and wait can't carry this on and on

I'd be standing in the corner
I'd be waiting just to hold ya
I'd be
Waiting pretty baby just to dance with you

Somehow they're gone
Somehow they're playing
I'm tired and worn
But I'm still standing

I'm just saying hmm hmm baby
I'd be waiting ah baby
I'd be waiting ah baby just to dance with you

I'm just saying hmm hmm baby
I'd be waiting ah baby
I'd be waiting ah baby
I'd be waiting ah baby just to dance with you
