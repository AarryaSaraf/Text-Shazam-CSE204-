On the run and run I'm wailing
I want to throw my arms and shake
I guess you get too hard to remember
And I can't put a finger on it
I'll reach a point and I'll quit running
Too tired to move my legs
What's the holdup, what keeps stalling
Why a man that you can't tame?

I just don't hear or wait anymore
I'm just a half-with, easily floored
I think I'll fall out, and try it again
I think its long gone, and so far we've fell
I wonder what we really are

I guess you caught me in my whimper
I tried to skip and break my legs
You found a place to stick let linger
And that sort of bothers me
What's the point, well why keep rolling?
One morning you'll awake
Too much dust and I can't shake off
Lay down, pull the covers over me

I've just been honed out, pinned any chord
I'm just some fall back, weak little whore
A man that's stronger, I lost it somewhere
That's just the way we whimper and wail
