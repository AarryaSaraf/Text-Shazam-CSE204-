We built fires large enough that it burned the woods.
Remember the sparks that caught the wind and torched the field.
We stomped at the grass in the cracks and the crust to no avail.
And I'll get burned if the wind takes more than it should.
And hey, it's a crazy life.

I got a mark, a stain from pitch and it don't wash out.
And you never know what's buried there unless you dig around.
When we get back we can clean it up and show it off.
I got plenty of bones been chipped from falling down.
And hey, what a crazy life.
And hey, what a crazy life.

I Am.
I Am.
I Am.
I Am.
I Am.
