Long ago and far away
In my old common labor shoes
I turned the world all which a way
Just because you asked me to

Likened to no other feel
Simple love is simple, true
There's no end to what I'd do
Just because you asked me to

Let the world call me a fool
But if things are right with me and you
That's all that matters and I'll do
Anything you asked me to

Knowin' how much I love you
And after all that I've been through
I'd turn and walk away from you
Just because you asked me to
Lord, I hope you never do

Let the world call me a fool
But if things are right with me and you
That's all that matters and I'll do
Anything you asked me to
