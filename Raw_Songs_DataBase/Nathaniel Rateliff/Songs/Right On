When you get tired of the wings that carry you nowhere
You stretch out your arms to see if the wind will blow you over
It seems like it's tightening, the line in the crease of your shoulder
But never in after gift of the ground
Remember the good work you done
Remember there's always some feeling, when you try to sing like
Do do do da daaaa do daa
Do do do da daaaa do daa

Say you come with me
Tell me tomorrow
Softer in their eyes
Sleep in the arrow
Say that you're with me
And we leave tomorrow
And sleep throught the daylight
Leave all the sorrow
It stands, to wave us and more
I am, am older right on
I march all over
This space, has a name, that you can't, put fame, to at all
Do do do da daaaa do daa
Do do do da daaaa do daa

It seems like the timing are complete in the mist of the measure
And the wind did'n smile then wave than forever
Well I know it's right cause
The pitch, and the purch on the lips and it love so smooth
You'll have to try and guess where it landed
I'm made be the march all over
And made be ruler all over
We're all together, right on, right on
Do do do da daaaa do daa
Do do do da daaaa do daa

Say you come with me
Tell me tomorrow
Softer in their eyes
Sleep in the arrow
Say that you're with me
We leave tomorrow
Sleep throught the daylight
Leave all the sorrow
Mhm mhmh mhmhmh
Do do doooo do doo do do
Do do doooo do doo do do
Do do doooo do doo do do
Do do doooo do doo do do
Do do doooo do doo do do
Do do doooo do doo do do
