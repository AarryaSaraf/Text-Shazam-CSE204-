Lonesome low dog blues, holes in both my shoes
I wish I had a darlin' to tell my troubles to
Worried 'bout tomorrow, today's like yesterday
I've got nothin' to do and I got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues

I had my share of troubles, never laid my burdens down
Lonesome always follows me like a shadow on the ground
An ocean full of misery is just a drop to me
I've got nothin' to do and I've got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues

Lonesome low dog blues, holes in both my shoes
I got nothin' to do and I got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues

Old hound dog chained in the backyard and he wishes he was free
But he's got food and water, he's better off than me
I don't worry about money, money don't worry about me
I've got nothin' to do and I've got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues

Lonesome low dog blues, holes in both my shoes
I wish I had a darlin' to tell my troubles to
Worried 'bout tomorrow, today's like yesterday
I've got nothin' to do and I got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues
Nothin' to do and I got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues
