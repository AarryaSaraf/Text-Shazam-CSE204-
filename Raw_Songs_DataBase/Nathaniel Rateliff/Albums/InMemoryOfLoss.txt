// Once In A Great While //

We could bail out either side, or take a rest
Find me in the corner with your nervous laugh
In my hesitation don't you pass
I might be the only fool who cares

But don't you feel like you're under this wave (of staggering charm[?])

One was set to carry you, and never came
I was laying hungry but surprised to be
But I sure love the way that you (lingered here/linger dear[?])

Once in a great while I could be (so bright/right[?])
And more than I can say it just feels awfully right
(And borrowing every angle 'till it's centered in 'I'[?])

Don't be so bashful
It's me in the shadows
And I'm laying, groaning
Until you find a way back to me
Until you find a way to soothe me

Well tell me, it's starlight
It's stars in your eyes

// Early Spring Till //

I was out there missing steps, when you swung around to me
Best to land, not to crash, your pulling out too late
Call on everyone you ever knew, and plead
Well I've been the bum who's underfed
I've been the one and I should've said
Maybe I'm wrong and I've always been that way
Are you tired do you feel wrung out?
Have you fallen from where glory sprouts
Are you cut off in fields and pressed down
Like an early spring till that don't come around

I think I've been there

I think I'm waiting too long
You try this panting and paw
You set a course to cross me out
Are you tired and broken, once so stout
Are you full of the feeling, don't doubt it when it's gone
I could cut up this reel and leave now
I could fill up with air and scream so loud

I think I'm going to

// We Neve Win //

He's a manic boy
Looks a lot like me
Looks a lot like me
And he shares the blame

With a younger face
It's hard and rushed to see
And it's hard for us to see
But I can tell

Is it cold enough
Does it chatter your teeth
And the wind won't set you free
And it never has

Like an old time revival
Shake your hands, and shake your hips
Put up all my armour
Let me stand bear, with just two fists

// Brakeman //

I was a brakeman
The sharpest of all them
Hoping to be there in it good

I was a bum rush
And pardon the self lust
It wasn't always understood

I was comb man
I comb every short line
I wanted to damage just a few

Hoping in time it won't be swift enough
And they'll carry us away
And they'll carry us away

I was a cold one
Colder than ever
You feel the chill I left on you

Now back on the brake lines
Steeper than I climbed
Well if there's one will it be you?

Take your ride, and take your fall
And laying your trap for me

Take this wig above my head
It did what it had to do

It runs back to straight and true
And leaving no more..

// Longing And Losing //

I must be our ruin
I must dead iron
Don't short-sight it's worth
It comes to steal mine
It comes as it always has
And in keeping me hid
There must be
Peace in the morning
Peace in the night
Peace in the daylight
Let it out stand forever
Does it outstand so plight
May it wash all us over
And its back-breaking crime
Let it cast me far forward
'Til the end of my life
There must
Be peace when eyes are open
Peace her eyes to find
Let us rest till it's over
Let us soak up the healing
Tonight

// Oil & Lavender //

And being outside your wisdom
And stretching the truth
I was the oil and lavender
But never for you
You had to toil and sit in
The sun browned your skin
It burned all the alabaster
Till the ash choked the wind
They say it's the longest light
To ever have shown
They say it's the longest lie
And that nobody knows
They say it's the longest lie
And I still taste the smoke
Now only ungrateful remember [?]
To sleep in the stone
With all of your grace and thunder
The roll and the boom
I was the cloak and dagger
That snuck into you
And we have but one (left[?]) finger
That's pointing at us
And that would be the longest night
That chilled [?] to bone
That would be the longest night
To sleep here alone
That would be the longest night
I think you'd be warmer closer to me

// Shroud //

I'm looking more like my mother
I was so staggering waiting for you
I was so sure in my barely bending knees, and nobody cared for more
It does no good to talk about anything
It does no good to tell you I'm a wounded fiend
It's not the things we discover, it's in the way we try to cover with ground
I made a flat-fingered dollar I was so sure and never right
I was a tongue that's telling you that somebody else is trying

And I got no feeling about it at all
In this old season of doubt and love
And I got no reason to bury it here

I could go backwards forever
I could be boxed inside
And living without, well don't blow my cover
It's taken years to make a beautiful shroud
I got no use in talking about anything
And I could tell you it seems to be so hard to me
It does no good to talk about anything
Aaah-ohh [x6]
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

// You Should've Seen The Other Guy //

We get out of this fight
You gonna help me wrap my hands
Stitching up my eyes
You know blood can blind

And them was big old boys
Had fists like cinder and stone
I dodge a blade on the dime
And they was out to cut my throat

It's a lot, It's a mark they're gonna press down on you
It's a haze on my head, must've been hit too hard, off guard

I think I'm gonna be it tonight
If there's one way out
It's to swing my way through the crowd

Is there a blanket of pain
That I can wrap up in
You've got a hold of me now
Hey that's a helluva grip
And I admit I was tanked
And you could say I was pissing gin

It's hard to see even if I close my eyes
It's fifteen degrees I'm gonna sleep outside

Cos I got no way to feel and no way to ride
I'm busted laid up and dry

// Whimper And Wail //

On the run and run I'm wailing
I want to throw my arms and shake
I guess you get too hard to remember
And I can't put a finger on it
I'll reach a point and I'll quit running
Too tired to move my legs
What's the holdup, what keeps stalling
Why a man that you can't tame?

I just don't hear or wait anymore
I'm just a half-with, easily floored
I think I'll fall out, and try it again
I think its long gone, and so far we've fell
I wonder what we really are

I guess you caught me in my whimper
I tried to skip and break my legs
You found a place to stick let linger
And that sort of bothers me
What's the point, well why keep rolling?
One morning you'll awake
Too much dust and I can't shake off
Lay down, pull the covers over me

I've just been honed out, pinned any chord
I'm just some fall back, weak little whore
A man that's stronger, I lost it somewhere
That's just the way we whimper and wail

// Boil & Fight //

I was taking long in lane
While they boil and fight
While they boil and fight
I was taking all my days
And all night
And all night
Maybe you skip and walk
Maybe you tap your heels
It won't matter at all
If you just stand still
Taking it off, see how it feels
Taking a long way through the fields
Honey that's alright
Maybe you're too tired to wake
Well rub your eyes
Rub your eyes
I could try to tell you what it is
Well it's more than hi
Well it's more than hi
We got em off the ground again
We gonna wait till the sun lets us in
We got along fine without any friends
We got a long ride to think about it

// When We Could //

If you call our names
We'll come arise and ready and primed
Such a sturdy face
You can tell we're aging by the lines
Keep on saying how
That's sort of fine and strange, although
Even if the wind has ceased to blow
We won't run and we won't cry
Look how we stand forever more, when we could
Staying up and laughing all night, when we could
Keep on smiling till it's bright, when we could
When we could
You sure called it right
You said I'd wither and not grow back
It's not a fine way to go
I think we left there with our pride
I hate to call out hands
But pardon my way of being slow
Cover me up and let me go
And make it as thick and as dark as the night
And we could laugh forever more, when we could
Tear it up like the dogs at night, when we could
And we could fight and bury it all, when we could
When we could
When we could...

// A Lamb On The Stone //

Do you think your a man to talk?
Do you think I mind at all?
Don't say...
How he was livin it up in a run...
Do you want to be the hammer?
Against broken necks unbent
You got hooks in me that stretch my skin
Like it was some old Indian dance
But wait...
I think you finally found a way to get into me
And hey...
I might be cut in half
Awwww, there's big confusion at the border to nowhere
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb?

Are you tryin to tan my hide?
Is there a spoon and salt behind the door?
Or do you pour it on the floor to get down?
I'm just another lamb on the stone
Grill the meat right to the bone
And feast on it
Or do you throw it to the foul of the air?
But wait, I thought you wanted me to let up the anchor
And hey, why do you tie it to the rope around my neck?
Awww, is this a cause for your mission and virtue?
Hey, what's the trouble with softness of skin?
I'm just another one to hide in the corner
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb

But wait, I thought you wanted me to let up the anchor
And hey, why do you tie it to the rope around my neck?
Awww, is this a cause for your mission and virtue?
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb?

// When You're Here //

When you're here
When you're out
I wanna know it
I wanna know it
When you feel
When you doubt
And when all of this fails
I wanna know it
I wanna know it
Don't you get heavy, hanging around
Don't you get tired of me
When you're here
When you're down
I wanna know it
I wanna know it
Don't you get up when too quickly then you're out
Don't you get off it and really leave me out
Don't you get tired of hanging around
Don't you get tired of me and the sound

// Happy Just To Be //

I was ever lame and once was there, shallow diggin' deep
With hope and heart to heal
Fell into a hole we had dug, covered with some leaves
Covered you and me
Seems so complicated now we're down, and wanting to be free
I'm happy just to be

And when you feel the running, must have set its roots
All other heaviness will one day call a truce
I'm happy just to be

Felt it as it angled its way through, a sight I'd never seen
And saw it stickin' through
Pulled as much as I could force myself, and it would never do
No matter how I try
And now it comes to festering and swell, needle stitchin' threat
And close it once it's clean

And when you feel the running, must have set its roots
All other heaviness will one day call a truce
I'm happy just to be

// Laughing //

You're looking thin anyways
And you stare right through me
Surprised to be leg to leg

Is there a place we could run
And you could hide with me
And take our time doing nothing at all

We got tungsten rope tying us down
And this tiny crown
Will be our shield for hope and love

And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
Until we're gone

Pretend you're the wind
Pretend I'm the sun
And how warm I make
How warm I make
Your air

And if it's not too much love
Cover my eyes for me
It's a bright morning
And we're waking up

And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
Until we're gone

Even when they got us pinned, we're laughing
Even when they got us pinned, we're laughing
Even when they got us pinned, we're laughing
Even when they got us pinned, we're laughing
Even when they got us pinned, we're laughing
We're laughing
We're laughing
We're laughing
We're laughing
We're laughing

// Pounds And Pounds //

And it's out of breath
And it's spinning around,
In love with the sound of it's own voice,

And it's toughest skin has been stretched so thin, it's invisible to us

And if I forget will your hand be soft and guide me through it?
And above all the rest I can't seem to pound my fist in deep enough...

There is no end without you

There is no end without you
There is no sun to keep us warm in the winter
Without you
I am... I am... I am... without you
