// The Mirror's Truth //

This spectacle, our collapse
It's not a false alarm
The ashes settle in.

I guess, we are the insane
As we ignore the mirror's truth

Should I join the feast?
Should I acknowledge the leash?
A future in captivity
I'm not who I'm supposed to be.

Without even trying (killing the last scene)
Let this light explode.

The bleeding, we deceive them
Fuel the life that fades
At the height of reason
We shouldn live by your laws
Call the swarm
Feed them another false hope.

[x2]
Without even trying (killing the last scene)
Let this night explode
Without even trying
Find the exit sign and disappear

// Disconnected //

Look at the dead outside my window
Wonder what's on their mind?
Why do they run?
They all seem to have a mission
But then they cry themselves to sleep

[Chorus:]
You receive what you give
And this is like nothing
I feel like shit
But at least I feel something

Is this all you meant to be?

Their marks in the pavement
You've walked this route too many times
What if I changed the signs?
Would you even take notice?

[Chorus]

Is this all you have to give?
So... March... Straight jacket union...
So... March...
In chains - surrender

[Chorus x2]

// Sleepless Again //

Hopeless times approach
Just give into the chaos
Strangely I find comfort here
Impatient and curious of what may come

...And so the rampage begins
Against the headache I can't win

[Chorus:]
Drain Me
Keep me in the dark
I don't want to take part
Prefer to be forever numb

Nothing great can come out of this
But I'm hostage to myself
I fear I might collapse on the razor's edge
And I fear I'll realize when it's too late

...And so the rampage begins
Against the headache I can't win

[Chorus]

Sleepless again

I need to ease my mind
And kill what burns inside

Sleepless again

I can't win

[Chorus]

// Alias //

The serpent knows,
When the curtain falls,
With denials blindfold,
He greets another day

[Chorus:]
Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie,
A perfect ten,
When reality caves in
Don't tell me,
Tell my ghost,
'cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
I found secrets about life's undertow

Life's wrapped in a riddle,
Easier said than done,
Way to play the victim,
Rather run and hide.

[Chorus]

Let them take me far away

Crawl back in place,
It's easier to cope behind the curtain,
Wipe the worries away
No thought about the consequence

[Chorus]

Let them take me far away

// I'm The Highway //

I am my deepest shadow
Something I can't ever neglect
Rise above these ashes
Or fall and fade away

In dark moments, I know better
Within destruction, I see clearly

From here to new grounds
Suppose I will do it alone
With a smile through black design
Fearless of your conviction

Staring into truth, I am the highway
Existence, care for me in all
Your everlasting complications

In dark moments, I know better
Within destruction, I see clearly

From here to new grounds
Suppose I will do it alone
With a smile through black design
Fearless of your conviction

Forget the promised land
There was never an invitation
Today I create my own
Before there was sorrow
And lack of attention

From here to new grounds
Suppose I will do it alone
With a smile through black design
Fearless of your conviction

// Delight And Angers //

Everyday takes figuring out how to live,
Sometimes it feels like a mistake,
Sometimes it's a winner's parade,
Delight and angers,
I guess that's the way it's supposed to be...

[Chorus:]
Please heal me, I can't sleep
Thought I was unbreakable, but this is killing me
Call me, everything, make me feel unbreakable,
Lie and set me free

I feel the fear takes hold
Afraid this hell I create is my own
Calm my franticness, I can't take it anymore,
This used to be my own world,
But now I've lost control

[Chorus]

Chasing leftovers,
Under the fading sun,
Searching for shelter,
I feel my time has come

[Chorus]

// Move Through Me //

Consume the curse
That brings you down
(A fading liar)
Who wakes up alone

It's there
In front of you

[Chorus:]
Invert this tragedy to come
And reclaim your future
This is a call to arms
One quest at a time

Feed the hunger,
Climb on up
Repress the negative
You are not alone

It's there
In front of you

[Chorus]

Avoid the mould
Desperate you regress
Move through me
I'll be your triumph

[Chorus]

// The Chosen Pessimist //

Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure
Tell me which side I'm on
(Who's friend or foe?)
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying (slowly)

In many ways I'm the burden that divides us from the light
In many ways you're the halo that keeps my spirit alive

Temptation
Play the good or evil part
With me, you evoke the dark
Erase the free will and watch me heal

Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying...

Amused by the trials and tribulations
If I survive I fly from here
But as the chosen pessimist

I carve my name in stone
I carve my name in stone

Amused by the trials and tribulations
If I survive I fly from here

How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith I'm dying...

// Sober And Irrelevant //

Used to be original,
But now I tremble in fear
I am like everyone else
And that buries me

Is this how it feels
To reach rock bottom
Want to know how it feels to be forgotten?

[Chorus:]
I've become the distance,
I am the sober and irrelevant,
I don't feel part in this,
What is there to believe?

I'm not asking for much, just a moment
A chance to pick up the pieces
Happiness, please, come home

What if it ends right here
How do I change it?
Hoping to find a saviour
I've lost my way

[Chorus]

Is this how it feels
To reach rock bottom
Want to know how it feels to be forgotten?
Hoping to find a saviour
I've lost my way

[Chorus]

// Condemned //

So restless,
These walls drain my thoughts
Room 307
Can't find my way out

It used to be my home
This cage, far from my comfort zone
Alive but without control...
Fear is taking hold

I should cross the line
Confront like the blind

[Chorus:]
Hear a distant cry...
Would you tell me how
To break the cycle that I'm in
And discover the living?

I don't recognize my soul
Condemned to live in this black hole?
Dig within time... and crave what is mine.

[Chorus]

I should cross the line...
Confront like the blind

Hear a distant cry...
Would you tell me how
To break the cycle that I'm in

It's a hill to climb
Would be a dream if I,
Design a future and
Not the end of time

// Drenched In Fear //

You won't
Find a friendly face in the crowd,
It's quite amusing to see how you suffer

I refuse, to let you steal my daylight,
Barely awake - but it strengthens my night rage
I've seen you kill many dreams,
But I got brand new armour,
And your weapons are way out of reach

How does it feel to be demolished,
Vaporized into thin air?
Strange new feeling to be nothing.

[Chorus]
All the words I hear... they don't mean a thing [x2]
All drenched in fear,
And the hate you bring

Make me bother, I dare you,
I've got the strength I need,
But I'll await my darkest moment,
When the guilt doesn't get to me.

[Chorus x2]

// March To The Shore //

I used to adore you
The lies made sense somehow
Gave myself away without a fight
But the betrayal claims its price

At first I was scared
Not used to a murder's mind
But there was something beautiful
So powerful, so definite, so divine

Pushing the faith
Build out of rage

[Chorus:]
Falling ideals
Broken seals
March to the shore
You are a killer!

Is it something that's always been there?
Was it always destined to leave its cage?
I'm glad we met though
I love to release the rage

But everything has its end
And I've done my deed
The final bullet - always meant for me

Pushing the faith
Build out of rage

[Chorus]

But everything has its end
And I've done my deed
The final bullet - always meant for me

[Chorus x2]

// Eraser //

Consume, just like a worm,
Catch a glimpse of the sun through cracks,
Everything, I swallow whole,
And hide before the flood.

The way I see things,
I wish they could be true,
But take me all the way.
The trail of the torment,
Is not a path anymore,
But take me for a ride.

Delete the past, the fear,
Delete the past, every step is pure,
Delete the past from here, forward,
Delete the past, every step is pure.

Afraid of lost control,
Still there's a part of me that wants to feel insecure,
Afraid of lost control,
It keeps me on the edge.

Delete the past, the fear,
Delete the past, every step is pure,
Delete the past from here, forward,
Delete the past, every step is pure.

The way I see things,
I wish they could be true,
But take me all the way.

Delete the past, the fear, forward,
Delete the past, every step is pure,
Delete the past from here, forward,
Delete the past, every step is pure.

// Tilt //

We all find ourselves,
In honour of the good cause.
How empty we've become,
With our sight to be the true force.

Does every instinct say you're right?
I think sometimes there is doubt.

You're waiting for a re-run,
But yesterday won't come.
Want to relive the moment,
But yesterday is done.

Lies and desperation lead us through as we're trying to be heroic,
I swept the world (?) to watch you manage.
Take a step back,
I'll tie you to it.

You're waiting for a re-run,
But yesterday won't come.
Want to relive the moment,
But yesterday is done.

Hopes and prayers in pursuit of salvation,
Take a short cut, it only bends our cause.
But as far as I remember,
There is nothing that will get back the days you lost.

Does every instinct say you're right?
I think sometimes there is doubt.

You're waiting for a re-run,
But yesterday won't come.
Want to relive the moment,
But yesterday is done.

// Abnegation //

We believe but we are deceased
Or soon to be.
I act surprised
You've seen the seas,
It's just enough to feed the trees.

We believe but we are not free,
This wasteland is our prison.
I act surprised?
I see the bones through your skin,
This radiation from within.

I grant you this torn land,
I'd rather not live here anymore.
Don't say I didn't try,
But I'd rather not live here anymore.

We believe but we don't see
The coming of the storm.
Why act surprised?
There are warnings from time to time,
Signs of our own decline.

We are the scavengers,
We plunder and rape,
We're the guests here, the new breed,
But act like it's ours to take.

I grant you this torn land,
I'd rather not live here anymore.
Don't say I didn't try,
But I'd rather not live here anymore.

We believe but we don't see.

I grant you this torn land,
I'd rather not live here anymore.
Don't say I didn't try,
But I'd rather not live here anymore.

I grant you this torn land,
I'd rather not,
Don't say I didn't try,
But I'd rather not live here anymore.
