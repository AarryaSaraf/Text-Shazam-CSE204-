// F(r)iend //

As they all felt the fire
They turned me into an outsider
I never heard from them again
So ironic when you called for a favor today

It's always easy to judge
But it takes a lot to be specific
Cause as you preach you're opening the door
To your egos past

There was a day when I could forget
I could forgive but those days are gone
I see them fade

Filth in every new day
Filth runs in every new day

I learned to mute the anger
I never thought I would be there again a moment, a dead end
I lost myself in here

Filth in every new day
Filth runs in every new day

I ran as I saw the end
Should I have joined the fight instead
Hope you are listening cause now times have changed

I take a look around
I say this moments mine
Flee all the weak minds
Feel my missed hidden rage

Filth in every new day
Filth runs in every new day

// The Quiet Place //

Spinning further, deeper
I know you're out to try me
I'm not in this to be a slave
Push the dirt, make me feel
Locate what swallows life
Night bird you build my world

..and then I close my eyes
..and then I close my eyes

Judge me now
Used to be afraid to let it show, bow down
A king in my own mind
Everything's in place so much brighter from today

Drown the monster
Make all bad dreams go away
Whatever it takes to keep your hands free
Open scars, the quiet place
All the bridges fall to the ground and you say you sacrificed

..and then I close my eyes
..and then I close my eyes

Judge me now
Used to be afraid to let it show, bow down, bow down!
A king in my own mind
Everything's in place so much brighter from today
A king in my own mind

Judge me now
A king in my own mind
Judge me now
A king in my own mind

Judge me now
Used to be afraid to let it show, Bow down, bow down!
A king in my own mind
Everything's in place so much brighter from today
A king in my own mind

// Dead Alone //

I'll always belong to the shadow
Don't show me new results
I will never enter your heaven
Make the most of my dirty cell

Creeps infected by control
That's what put me in here
Dig deep don't think you ever get to the place where they buried me
The last glimpse that I had
Fragments, pieces of some things valuable
Even though it doesn't make sense anymore
I release my last fear

[Chorus:]
The cold worms and me
We're alone and free
The dead light inside
Fuel to new seed
We're alone and free

When there are only my bones
Please put them in use
Want to be part of a new dawn
The darkness disappears
Don't release these chains
Never been closer to myself
All your mistakes run though
As I realize what we become
The end is here to bid farewell
I'll turn to ash and hear them sing
Songs about my emotions dead and alone
Don't make an effort you don't know me anyway

My frustration, my conversation, why are we even here?
The abuse that we use I do not longer care

[Chorus]

// Touch Of Red //

Reaching depth of clarity
I'm not supposed to be like this
I should be on the top of the world
Is anybody out there like me?

I followed something's missing
Self control Forcing me down
Whispers consume the air
Above her I'm endless

When the rain comes falling
I'll freeze I'm so afraid
When things start to flood me
I will drown in seconds

Fear - There's no way out
Touch of red
Break away
Nothing has it all
Bury the place I've been
I fear there's no way out

As If I ever had a choice
All in the hands of the energy
Once again feel the quicksand swallow me
Tonight = I won't struggle

Fear - There's no way out
Touch of red
Break away
Nothing has it all
Bury the place I've been
I fear there's no way out

The weak in me should know I'm as sober as I could be

Fear - There's no way out
Touch of red
Break away
Nothing has it all
Bury the place I've been
I fear there's no way out

// Like You Better Dead //

I can be as angry as I want to be
Just watch me burn
I think you're way too cold
Just watch and learn

I'll never sleep here anymore
My house is not my home
I like you better dead
And I'm better off alone

Destiny, will you cure me?
Trust, will you age with me?
Hear me scream
Destiny, will you cure me?
Hear me scream as I face tomorrow

Your vision may be in colour, but you look all pale
In these times we should be learning, but with you I'll always fail

Destiny, will you cure me?
Trust, will you age with me?
Hear me scream
Destiny, will you cure me?
Hear me scream as I face tomorrow

I need to save myself before I drown
It took so long to see
The world your mind creates
It pushes me under

Destiny, will you cure me?
Trust, will you age with me?
Hear me scream
Destiny, will you cure me?
Hear me scream as I face tomorrow

// My Sweet Shadow //

I'm selling heavenly sketches
A world out of my mind
Ready to explode in purity to fill the holes inside

An ever moving stream with glowing rays of light
Emotions tied to pass lies and I know I should let go

Tamed with confidence of a brighter future

I found a flame in the burnt out ashes... burn out, burn out!

Fueled, these new shores burn, dark past lies cold
Shadow, my sweet shadow, to you I look no more

Another dawn collapses
Do I need to be reminded
A glimpse of my safe home
A path to hide all anger

I found a flame in the burnt out ashes... burn out, burn out!

Fueled, these new shores burn, dark past lies cold
Shadow, my sweet shadow, to you I look no more

In circles I catch
A torch carried by the immortal
From depths that I created
In vain echoes fade

Burn out!

Fueled, these new shores burn, dark past lies cold
Shadow, my sweet shadow, to you I look no more

Fueled, these new shores burn, dark past lies cold
Shadow, my sweet shadow, to you I look no more

Fueled, Dark past lies cold
For you I look no more

// Evil In A Closet //

We were one in words
You finished my sentence
I could never attract tomorrow
It pushes me aside

I sink in waters deep
Your presence kept me floating far from depths where secrets lie
Maybe in another lifetime I can be the first you meet

I once read a poem
Held my breath but that moment's gone
First time I felt life somewhat hurts
I need an option, a reason and some hope

Yell at me, I want to be your light that shines
But my ground is shaking, and I might fall
I wish that I could say, I wish that I could be your evil in a closet

Yell at me, I want to be your light that shines
But my ground is shaking and I might fall
I wish that I could say, I wish that I could be your evil in a closet

// In Search For I //

It hurts to think
Can't get the sums together
Would you draw my bitterness
Make the pictures fade

Could it be that I see
What's beneath when we fall
The truth in ever
I'm scared that I will be

The sentence is light
But my eyes see a different world
And all I do is turn into flames

Will time open my vault
New solution, I'm begging
Break the fuse that holds me back

The I is lost in me
But I am ready to give you The M,
It might even be the E
As I begin to search for I
The I is lost in me

Distract, push me in another direction
This wall that I stare into
It's getting old
Give me faith to reach for the new
Pull me apart and do me all over
I'll need a re-make
To make up for my mistakes

The I is lost in me
But I am ready to give you The M,
It might even be the E
As I begin to search for I
The I is lost in me

What if I stop to care?
What if I let you fall?

What if I stop to care?
What if I let you fall?

The I is lost in me
But I am ready to give you The M,
It might even be the E
As I begin to search for I
The I is lost in me

// Borders And Shading //

You Took a knife and carve it in
Want to see your faults
As a part of your pretty skin
Everyone has a tragedy
I want you to wear yours in pain

Oblivion can no longer shade you
Reminded by the tattered tissue

Bleak silence
Errors stigmatized in you
A weak worn out friend
There's nothing left for me

Again and again
Your face reminds me of a bleak future
Despite the absence of hope
I give you this sacrifice

You're so far, behind
Be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
Cause I look the other way

I will crawl into your vault
Pass snakes and old rotten thoughts
Leaving a hotbed of virulence
Your world inside slowly redesigned

Again and again
Your face reminds me of a bleak future
Despite the absence of hope
I give you this sacrifice

You're so far, behind
Be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
Cause I look the other way

Again and again
Your face reminds me of a bleak future
Despite the absence of hope
I give you this sacrifice

You're so far, behind
Be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
Cause I look the other way

You're so far, behind
Be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
Cause I look the other way (Save yourself)

// Superhero Of The Computer Rage //

I am the past, Future
I've been chosen
You think it's over
But I'm ready to go
I am what you fear
I've been chosen
The world as you know it just died
It's the end of all time

I am a surprise
Even to myself I'm a genius
Superhero of the computer rage
In plastic I'll bury
I am what you fear
I've been chosen
The world as you know it just died
It's the end of all time

Everything you say is denied
I'll be the devil on this ride

Dark clouds in your heaven
Your end has only begun
You can scream but there's no rescue
I promise I'll make you sure you that die in time

I am the maggot
In your infected life
No matter how hard you try
I'll leave without a scar
I am a legend
In your infotainment life
It's when I say "it's over"
It's you who's been chosen

Everything you say is denied
I'll be the devil on this ride

Dark clouds in your heaven
Your end has only begun
You can scream but there's no rescue
I promise I'll make you sure that you die in time

Everything you say is denied
I'll be the devil on this ride

Dark clouds in your heaven
Your end has only begun
You can scream but there's no rescue
I promise I'll make you sure that you

Dark clouds in your heaven
Your end has only begun
You can scream but there's no rescue
I promise I'll make you sure that you're dead

// Dial 595-Escape //

Could it be a new day?
Fear in me so deep
You push me out, I feel far
The absence, close to me
The other side I crawl
You push me out, I fall

Heal my wounds, take everything away,
You convocate me
Sick of cycles, drop to zero
A while just like last times
My least favorite re-run
Sick of cycles, I bounce in gray

Escape familiar home
Memories remains alone
Reality trapped inside
The wicked descend

Testing higher mentality
I conquer myself through this
A furious path to walk
New space exists beyond
In silence I dwell displeased
Remain with the seed of unfulfilment

Heal my wounds, take everything away,
You convocate me
Sick of cycles, drop to zero
A while just like last times
My least favorite re-run
Sick of cycles, I bounce in gray

Escape familiar home
Memories remains alone
Reality trapped inside
The wicked descend - I hide

Heal my wounds, take everything away,
You convocate me
Sick of cycles, drop to zero
A while just like last times
My least favorite re-run
Sick of cycles, I bounce in gray

Escape familiar home
Memories remains alone
Reality trapped inside
The wicked descend - I hide

Escape familiar home
Memories remains alone
Reality trapped inside
The wicked descend - I hide

// Bottled //

I really don't have anything to say
Just pass me by
Don't ask me the same questions
Just deny I am there

Like the time around me
This room is filled with nothing
Fell awkward in a place with many
Leave this space to me

I channel the pain through this
The paper, the pen, your eyes
To stare into what's next
It frightens me
No control, no reward

I'm in circles again

Still and breathless
I don't care what's behind
To you I look for energy
To catch my breath again

I channel the pain through this
The paper, the pen, your eyes
To stare into what's next
It frightens me
No control, no reward
I'm in circles again
I'm in circles again

The world looks old to me
Tonight I drink myself sober
Soon this could be over
Tale a picture of the pale

New morning knocking
Feels just like always
Pen down my regrets
I reach to you again

I channel the pain through this
The paper, the pen, your eyes
To stare into what's next
It frightens me
No control, no reward
I'm in circles again

I channel the pain through this
The paper, the pen, your eyes
To stare into what's next
It frightens me
No control, no reward
I'm in circles again
I'm in circles again

// Discover Me Like Emptiness //

I run this world alone
A song stuck in my mind
Are you feeling alright?
Don't mind if you ask me once

Discover me like emptiness
A defense for a broken heart
Still offers a smile to the world betrayed...

[Pre Chorus:]
Always close to the drop
Disappear with yesterday
Cure this dream that makes me fall

[Chorus:]
Blame me...
Escape me...
Well it's you who walked away
Tie me...
For my sake
To the dream that haunts you

Could never stand the middle
Want to go far and further
But something drags me down
Shapes me...
Forms me... into delusion...

As I bank other options
Make this picture distant
Signing off
Leave me alone
I blur you into... the never...
