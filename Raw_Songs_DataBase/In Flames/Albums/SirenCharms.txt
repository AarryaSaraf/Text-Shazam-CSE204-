// In Plain View //

The fire
My heads all wired
In plain view
There's nothing in the way
I see with clarity
The eye of destiny
But just a little spark
And once again... I don't know

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I've been hopelessly lost in the fear

Are we the only ones?
It's all dark in here
Do I just waste my time?
Searching for exits in infinite space

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I've been hopelessly lost in the fear
Are you for real?

All the lights
All the lights
Is that the future
Or another lullaby?

The fire
My heads all wired
In plain view
There's nothing in the way
I see with clarity
The eye of destiny

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I've been hopelessly lost in the fear
Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I've been hopelessly lost in the fear

// Everything's Gone //

Where I have nothing
Fearless and whole
Find out what you are
Back in time

No
I won't
I need this
Truth is...

Once you had enough
Break out
Room to breathe
To love before you're gone
Before you're gone

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece down
Everything's gone

Where I have nothing
There's no hate
Room to breathe
No envy and nothing to lose

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece down
Everything's gone

Once you had enough
Break out

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece down

// Paralyzed //

Monsters descend
Feeding on us
There is no sympathy
Breeding the hate

Turn away
Run away
From all the things we have to do
And it tears away our hearts and our soul

It's like we're on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
Rewind
There's no time
The wasteland... It's an indication

We're only taking turns
Passing around the world
It's how it's always been

Out of excuses
Will we understand?

That we're on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
This time
We have found the wasteland

Out of excuses
Will we understand?

It's like we're on our own
Figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
This time
We have found the wasteland

The wasteland

// Through Oblivion //

False affection took the best of me
Deep inside
The absent mind
Denial and hypocrisy
All in the same
To do this right we part our ways

My destination
My mission
My intuition
So close, I feel it changing me
Suddenly I know

I have to let it go
All has been lost
All has been won
Now I see it all right before me
The intentions are pure
I'm out of reach

My destination
My mission
My intuition
So close, I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe
And I have wings, I have
Nothing and everything at the same time
Oh, a brighter sun, no more rain

Save me from my fears
And darkest thought, I bare
Carry me through times
Through oblivion

My destination
My mission
My intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe
My destination
My mission
My intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe
'Cause now I know

// With Eyes Wide Open //

A fate that we deserve
There's no escape
We're walking backwards
I'm on your side
But life's a selfish thing
Like broken promises

A thousand times
Try to fake it
Just another liar

It's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't blame yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again
Colors fade from black to grey

How come we walk a mile
Just to shatter what we love?
Eyes wide open
Reflections of an unfamiliar face
Saying "You know where you are heading"

The lost dream
Of what could have been
It makes no difference

Cause it's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't blame yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again
Colors fade from black to grey

It's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't blame yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again
Colors fade from black to grey

// Siren Charms //

How far until the edge?
These wrong ways are mine
But the whole world can just go to hell
This life is killing me
My feelings inside I can't explain
I'm awake, but not for long

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds

I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

I gave you the story of my life
Some of my precious time
But I'm tired of this
With every promise of eternal light
Another feeling dies

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds

I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds

I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God
(Reach out touch the hand of God)

I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

// When The World Explodes //

I'm right here
When the world explodes
Try to remember these words
When the world explodes

In the darkest of nights
You are my endless fire inside
Across the waters and back to shore
Through space and time
You guide me

Afraid there's not much time
Life's a matter of moments
Face the truth
That I can't outrun
I always known

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know
Dry your eyes
Find the stream that leads to open water
Watch the divine
Come lay with me

Face the truth
That I can't outrun
I always known (I always known)

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know
Dry your eyes
Find the stream that leads to open water
Watch the divine
Come lay with me

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know
Dry your eyes
Find the stream that leads to open water
Watch the divine
Come lay with me

// Rusted Nail //

You want someone to blame
The one who drives the rusted nail
But who's left will never care
Pretending becomes a chore
All you search for, a little piece of mind
Too far, too deep, the two faced smile
So lost, you feel, I know

Wide awake but still asleep
Always a stranger in a crowd
Wide awake
Always a stranger in a crowd

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will, I'm there
Until the end of time

Leave the doomed behind
Search with different light
You were trying to remember
But it's all make believe

You are, you are, you are
(Wide awake but still asleep)
Wide awake but still asleep
Always a stranger in a crowd

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will, I'm there
Until the end of time

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want
I'm there
Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will, I'm there
Until the end of time

// Dead Eyes //

Throw it all away
Until we are erased
And it doesn't mean a thing

And I can't remember
What clear skies look like
Will I found out, that I'm late...
... for salvation

What if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away

This is my world now
I can't let you bring me down
Let this new faith guide me through
And things will come my way
Burn it down or join the line
Dead eyes will see again

Gravity takes control
Don't forsake my troubled times
I'm starting to regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don't let it slip away

I will be reborn

I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will
I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will

Throw it all away
Afraid I will drift on the open sea
I regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don't let it slip away

// Monsters In The Ballroom //

Without the sense of space or time
The infinite
The endless static
The doubt. We never had a way

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

Tormented minds they wander
Drifting away from the light
I will lift you up my friend
You have to learn to breathe again

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

Unlock the secrets
Let us find the memories
Find ourselves some ruins
Turn them into something

You are lost within
Fading out
A world that threw you away

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

// Filtered Truth //

We're all in this together
Or so I was told
All for one, one for none

When it's time
You know this could never be justified
But still you take the hatred home

Is this what you are searching for?

The wounded and it's filtered truth
Don't ignore a life that's real

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside

Your back turned against the world, you knew
A place to hide from everything
Am I the hand that made you fall?

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside

// The Chase //

The chase
A wild one
Has to become
Figuring out where you need to be
Find the pulse
Into with all you see
It's infront of you
Every other way
Leads to the same old great wall

Hit first with the speed of light
I won't be showing songs of me

In vain
Sometime
I'll find right where I belong
A life that was meant to be
Have faith in me

Sometimes it's hard to believe
The stories remain
I should just force right through
I guess it's for a reason 
we waiting in line at the station

Hit first with the speed of light
I won't be showing songs of me

In vain
Sometime
I'll find right where I belong
A life that was meant to be
Have faith in me
Have faith in me

Hit first with the speed of light
I won't be showing songs of me

In vain
Sometime
I'll find right where I belong
A life that was meant to be
Have faith in me

// Become The Sky //

I can see it all
It gets in my way
Before I end time
I close my eyes

It feels like I could find a place in this mess
And I dream that I'm blind

And I'm weightless when I become the sky

The earth, the moon, the sun beneath me
This is letting go
I'm all over
I reach far and wide

I want to be the one that believes
I feel like I'm part of this mess and I wish

That I'm weightless when I become the sky

The earth, the moon, the sun beneath me
This is letting go
I'm all over
I reach far and wide

The earth, the moon, the sun beneath me
This is letting go
This is on my mind
Let the world be mine
