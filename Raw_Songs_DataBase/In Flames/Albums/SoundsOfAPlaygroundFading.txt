// Sounds Of A Playground Fading //

You can find all you need
The message is in the silence
Whisper words to calm your mind
Reach inside
Numb the pain
Come around with answers

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

Staring into bright lights
I am what I've done
It is useless to hide
An empty chamber
Guess I was part of a plan

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

We're running out of time
Can't seem to recognize
What put us here in the first place
Counting down the days
Beginning of the end

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

// Deliver Us //

Remind me I'm golden...
The fortress above the sun
Why don't you spend nowhere with me?
Follow the river and the path of the ones write our names

On the shore

Forever - I can't find
Struggling in a world undefined
Decide how you want it to be
I'm not eternity

Fly into the distant
Disappear for awhile
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today feeling alive

It starts to fall apart
Let me take control, reminisce

The days and nothing more
Something I will find again, deliver us
Can't hear the words you say

But it doesn't really matter
I give the world to you, if you just

Fly into the distant
Disappear for awhile
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today ....alive

[Solo]

Fly into the distant
Disappear for awhile
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today alive

// All For Me //

Until the world ceases to move
That burning feeling
Let me go, this is real

Always one more thing
I clench my hands and bang my head

Take whatever comes to you
All the while, I don't need another friend

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night, and it's all for me now
I'm sure that one day
I can get you
All that you lost

I never told, blessed is the sick in me
I'm dying alone
We stand to fight for nothing
Without a thought, without a reason
We will never be okay

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night, and it's all for me now
I'm sure that one day
I can get you
All lost

A growing pain
It is hard to say what brought the darkest burden
For some of us, there's no answer

Chains are breaking
I won't let this build up inside of me
There's a storm coming
I will serve no more
Till my very last breath

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night, and it's all for me now
I'm sure that one day
I can get you
All that you lost

// The Puzzle //

And I tried to think
Tried to paint the picture
I lived it all
Wouldn't have to feel this way

Looking for something to believe in
I think I've done my time
One by one the pieces fall
Tell me what it is to believe

You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle, grab a piece of the light

Keep pretending, I can handle everything
You'll never understand me
And I don't care what you think
Or maybe I do?

One by one the pieces fall
Tell me what it is to believe

You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle, grab a piece of the light
Grab a piece of the light

You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle, grab a piece of the light

You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle, grab a piece of the light

// Fear Is The Weakness //

At least you could've tried
It is way past time and we're scattering ashes
You take everything in sight, please hear me now
You, you are leaving me with scars

Fear is the weakness in all of us
It's sad to see you go
It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down
Burden of the evidence grows

The same road for far too long
It's not meant to be
We are losing identity
Faith has been denied, let's not pretend
This is the first time, we just don't belong (here)

What world would you perceive?
All turn cold, no one cares for anyone
Waiting for the final blow
Do you have strength at all?
One more day, then we fade away

Fear is the weakness in all of us
It's sad to see you go
It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down
Burden of the evidence grows

The same road for far too long
It's not meant to be
We are losing identity
Faith has been denied, let's not pretend
This is the first time, we just don't belong here

(The same road for far too long)
It's not meant to be
We are losing identity
Faith has been denied, let's not pretend
This is the first time, we just don't, belong

// Where The Dead Ships Dwell //

Big picture slowly fades
Walls are closing in
And there I was, cursing the ground
Unable to understand

I won't let the world break me
So I need to change direction
Nothing special and far from perfect
Light the way for me
(I won't say I'm sorry, I got what I deserve)

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns
And I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

Walking where the dead ships dwell
These are shores I left behind
Streets were getting smaller
And I had to leave

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns
And I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

All I hear is noise
Hearts of false hope
Guess I took it all for granted
I know I went too far


I won't say I'm sorry
I got what I deserved
I got what I deserved

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns
And I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns
And I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

// The Attic //

There is someone in the attic
Building a strange machine
Never really seen him
But I think he works all day

Blinded by the world outside
I stay inside
Hardly know my name
But it's getting better by time

I saw something in the mirror
Someone is watching me
If I hide in the attic
They will never get to me

I found some rope on the floor
I have to build a trap
So I start on my machine
I'm never to be seen

// Darker Times //

September's here again
Every insecurity reminds you
Who's at the helm?
Darker times
With fear in the eyes
Who's the man in charge?
Invented isolation
Alone and safe inside
Struggle with words
That make sense in time
Yet waiting for someone to enter
Say, "I have a better plan"
"I have a better plan"
"I have a better plan"

Never have to worry
For all that we know
The truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in
For now it's fine
We're living the lie

When light breaks
Another way to matter
All questions somehow answered
When life comes crushing
At the early break of day
We've only come so far

Never have to worry
For all that we know
The truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in
For now it's fine
We're living the lie

Never have to worry
For all that we know
The truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in

Never have to worry
For all that we know
The truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in
For now it's fine
We're living the lie

// Ropes //

How much can we take before we care to settle?
Thought we were set for a perfect scene
Everyone is waiting for a failure
Something that can please and justify
A void within our lives
Everyone is waiting for something they cannot have

Why don't you drop your guard?
I'm on my knees
You got the mindset of a killer
And it will not take you far
If I had the answer, would that make you stay?
This is the time and place it is your moment of fate

If this would be your last breath
Would it change a thing?
Dive head first into the fire

If you just let me I'll find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me but believe me, I'm trying

What are you longing for?
What are you longing for?
What are you longing for?

If I had the answer
Would that make you stay
This is the time and place
You are waiting for something you cannot have

If this would be your last breath
Would it change a thing?
Dive head first into the fire

If you just let me I'll find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me

If you just let me I'll find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me, believe me, I'm trying

// Enter Tragedy //

Twisting tongue
Fallen off the edge again
Need some space
Need disgrace
I'm confused I'm in a maze

I need for you to pick me up
When I fall down
There's so much more, we can go far
But I can't control my selfish ways

Enter tragedy
Slash my soul
Why is it part of the plan?
Do you question me?
I question you

Who's the man in front of me?
I'm blindfolded, I can't see
(Need a reason, I'm left empty)

There's so much more, we can go far
But I can't control my selfish ways

Enter tragedy
Slash my soul
Why is it part of the plan?
Do you question me?
I question you

This inner apathy brings me to life
I know it's strange and it's draining me
I'm tired
I'm fed up
I'm a slave

I'm tired
I'm fed up
I'm a slave

Enter tragedy
Slash my soul
Why is it part of the plan?
Do you question me?
I question you
I question you

// Jester's Door //

I say goodbye to all at once
Don't dare to face you all alone
I went from wreckage to world class
With a box of T-shirts and some records to sell

But times have changed
I have to defend my actions
The foundation crumbles and I have to leave

Thanks for everything
I couldn't ask for more
I say "I love you all" as I vanish
Through the Jester's door

// A New Dawn //

I dreamed that you've died
I'm forever alone
I'm weak and I'm frightened
This brings about the change
Things you said to me
Believe and the things you might find
Will turn into a march

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
(It's moments like this)
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

Feel a sudden haze
Time to get moving
Getting somewhere with no directions
I swear to you it will never be the same
It's not straight, but the road lies open
Leaving all tears behind

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(It's moments like this)
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(It's moments like this)
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

Erase darkness from my mind
Last remaining night
From here to everywhere

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(It's moments like this)
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

// Liberation //

I know what it takes to break you
You know I never sleep
Just because you made them think
Doesn't mean the world will fall into place

Took some time but now you know
Tomorrow is too late
Close your eyes, walk with me, I set you free
And everything you ask for

I found the way and I'll return here soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight

If today was your last day, would that change a thing
You probably believe what you told them
Live each moment like your last
Close your eyes, walk with me, I set you free
And everything you ask for

I found the way and I'll return here soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight

I found the way and I'll return here soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight

I found the way and I'll return here soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight
