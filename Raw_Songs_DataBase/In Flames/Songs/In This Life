Breathing the dead
Underneath a sky that used to be blue
Each day living just enough
While the world is coming down

I can't focus, I can't control
Close to expired with a broken soul
The rage has left a hole
So strong I can't ignore

Waiting to cave in
Who am I and what and why
In life, in life
Searching for something
I can't find a smile that is mine
In this life, in life

Born to pretend
Anything to stay alive
But walls are closing in
And I'm prepared for the downfall

Wear your wounds with pride
But I have no more space and my body is heavy
Nothing will change my mind
So I wave the world goodbye

The rage has left a hole
So strong I can't ignore

Waiting to cave in
Who am I and what and why
In life, in life
Searching for something
I can't find a smile that is mine
In this life, in life

I can't focus, I can't control
Close to expired with a broken soul
The rage has left a hole
So strong I can't ignore

Waiting to cave in
Who am I and what and why
In life, in life
Searching for something
I can't find a smile that is mine
In this life, in life
