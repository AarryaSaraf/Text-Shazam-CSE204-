Find time and play with innocence
Like you ever would
I don't see you make any sense
I guess you deliver misery
Just like you should

1 o'clock and you paint the skies grey
It's not your fault We're the ones who betray
But how can you say it with such ease
You want to take a stand or just wanna please

Your bedtime story is scaring everyone
But you make me understand
The evil that man do
The evil that man do
