You know better, the things you should have done
It's so easy to avoid, to choose and run
The stronger you feel, push the stone up the hill
Your finest hour going in for the kill

Become the human you are to be
Free yourself from the misery
Wrong way, right way, we all make mistakes
No need for grieving, no matter how much it aches

I'm here to break your fall
I'll wait for you until you come back home

You're not alone, the struggle we all own
The Devil's real, you don't need to be scared of the scars
The sense, when everything fails
Search within to find what's in the way
You're not alone

Time's running out, you might be something that you're not
New world order, is that all that you got?
Pull the damn triggers and fire to the sky
This is not the day you die, it's a wonderful life

I'm here to break your fall
I wait for you until you come back home

You're not alone, the struggle we all own
The Devil's real, you don't need to be scared of the scars
The sense, when everything fails
Search within to find what's in the way
You're not alone

Pull the damn triggers and fire to the sky
This is not the day you die, it's a wonderful life

You're not alone, the struggle we all own
The Devil's real, you don't need to be scared of the scars
The sense, when everything fails
Search within to find what's in the way
You're not alone, you're not alone

You're not alone, the struggle we all own
The Devil's real, you don't need to be scared of the scars
The sense, when everything fails
Search within to find what's in the way
You're not alone
