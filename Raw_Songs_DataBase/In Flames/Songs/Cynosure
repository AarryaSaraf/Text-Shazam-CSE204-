A constant struggle
Lay your hands on me
I am nothing
I am the space in-between

I am the space in-between

Wrestle the demons
Thorns in my side
I am the pain
I am the blame

I feel paranoid
Are you a prophet?
I am the broken
I am the wound

Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say anything, I will be healed
Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say something that will make it real

Guilty of nothing
Who's left to blame?
I am the future
(I am the dream)

No more holding down
I prevail
I am the consequence
I am everything

Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say anything, I will be healed
Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say something that will make it real

Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say anything, I will be healed
Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say something that will make it real
