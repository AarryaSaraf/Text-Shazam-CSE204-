This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"

Have you heard the call?
It involves us one and all
From the rising sun until the day is done
Do you hear the call?

This is our time, we won't back down
From the rising sun until the day is done
Do you hear the call?
This is our time, we won't back down
No we won't back down
This is our time, I hear the sound
Of a thousand drums

Would you join me in the fight
The fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"

Have you heard the call?
Something must be done
From the top of the mountains to the deepest below
Do you hear the call?

This is our time, no we won't back down
This is our time, I hear the sound
Of a thousand drums

Would you join me in the fight
The fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
Would you join me in the fight
The fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"

From the top of the mountains to the deepest below
From the top of the mountains to the deepest below

This is our time, we won't back down
No we won't back down
This is our time, I hear the sound
Of a thousand drums

Would you join me in the fight
The fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
Please you join me in the fight
The fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"

This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
