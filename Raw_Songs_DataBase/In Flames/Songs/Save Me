So save me

Here's a hammer
Build a ladder
It's a long way up to heaven
If I dig it might take as long
But maybe in hell that's where I belong
Seven days and seven nights
Funny he found the fires
And I have walked this path before

I'm afraid I'd lose it all

Somebody save me
Somebody save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me

Just let it rain
I rather stay away
From laughs' overcoming
And the company of crows
Memories, they fade
But I'm far too awake
Welcome to my dream

I'm afraid I'd lose it all

Somebody save me
Somebody save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me
So save me

So save me
(Save me...)

Just let it rain
I rather stay away
From laughs' overcoming
And the company of crows
Memories, they fade
But I'm far too awake
Welcome to my charade

I'm afraid I'd lose it all

Somebody save me
Somebody save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me

Save me
Save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me

Save me...
Save me...
Save me...
Save me...
