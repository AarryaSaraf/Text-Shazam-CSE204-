I've been lost in a tree of stars
Now gravity is pulling hard
Reminding me of the end of time
Or something less defined

Come to terms with everything
That's a game one cannot win
Realize some dreams might die
And let go of the hate inside

I am awake
As I fade away
A perfect place
Here's my soul to take

All my life
I've been searching for this moment
I need this time
To turn it around, become one
The size of my shadow has blackened the sun
I need this time
To turn it around, become one

Heavy footsteps wear me down
I sometimes forget that I'm alive
Everyone will get what's coming
I, for one, am tired of running
