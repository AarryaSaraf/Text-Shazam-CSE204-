Close your eyes, what do you see?
The ashes of a place down on its knees

The world we knew has gone astray
We are the cancer, you and I

Choose your side, there are no winners
Hell is overcrowded and heaven's full of sinners

We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and we're running out of graves
We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and no one is listening

A new clean slate, it won't be happening
This is the one, so let us begin

Choose your side, there are no winners
Hell is overcrowded and heaven's full of sinners

We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and we're running out of graves
We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and no one is listening
End the transmission
Nothing makes sense and we're running out of graves
We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and no one is listening

We are but empty vessels with no ambition
No ambition
No ambition

This is a tomb and we are buried alive
We swallowed the spit and lived in denial
The devil has done his deed
Fed our egos and made us bleed
The devil has done his deed
Are all gods on the sidelines?
Passivity is not what the world needs

We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and we're running out of graves
We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and no one is listening
End the transmission
Nothing makes sense and we're running out of graves
We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and no one is listening
