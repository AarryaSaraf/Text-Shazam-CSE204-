Throw it all away
Until we are erased
And it doesn't mean a thing

And I can't remember
What clear skies look like
Will I found out, that I'm late...
... for salvation

What if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away

This is my world now
I can't let you bring me down
Let this new faith guide me through
And things will come my way
Burn it down or join the line
Dead eyes will see again

Gravity takes control
Don't forsake my troubled times
I'm starting to regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don't let it slip away

I will be reborn

I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will
I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will

Throw it all away
Afraid I will drift on the open sea
I regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don't let it slip away
