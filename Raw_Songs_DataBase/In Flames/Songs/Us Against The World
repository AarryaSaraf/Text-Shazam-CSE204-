I wish you would've listened
Can you hear me now?

You're in control
The thin red line
A change in life
The pride that cries
The lesson we should learn from lies
Dance across the sky
Conqueror of pain
The abandoned reign
You should be lord amongst the flies

I wish you would've listened
Can you hear me now?
Tell me what to do
I'm right beside you
It's us against the world
This can only end one way
Let's seize the day
It's us against the world

Oh, through the cracks
A new voice appears
Dividing the clouds
The horizon, the hope
From the most lonesome nights

I wish you would've listened
Can you hear me now?
Tell me what to do
I'm right beside you
It's us against the world
This can only end one way
Let's seize the day
It's us against the world
