I like to look at you from a distance
I like when you scream in my face
Afraid to say the right words, in right order
So they make sense to a person with such grace

What if my dreams don't become reality?
Is my life just a big mistake?
Will I be happy for the times I had
Or would I reconsider and recalculate?

I want to be heard but leave no trace
I want to be seen but take no space
I want to be
I want to be
Leave no trace
I want to be
I want to be
Take no space

The older I get, the younger I feel
The younger I feel, the older I seem
The more I feel, my age seems real
I like to pretend I'm as young as I feel

I want to be heard but leave no trace
I want to be seen but take no space
I want to be
I want to be
Leave no trace
I want to be
I want to be
Take no space

Leave no trace
Take no space
I want to be heard but leave no trace
I want to be seen but take no space
