We have come so far
Crawled through knives and artifacts
We had a purpose and a reason
Behind space and time

Ignore the fixed ideals
Serve your restless soul
Dedicated to all that's sacred
Measuring noise and sound

Reach a brand new level
Watch the worlds collide
Set yourself on fire
As we remember this forever
We remember this forever

When the sky is clear we will remember
Through thick and thin we won't surrender
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear we will remember

Calling our gathered masses
From the colony to the hives
I have come to realize
(This is) not an ordinary story

We're on a highway
Nothing left to lose
Set yourself on fire
As we remember this forever
We remember this forever

When the sky is clear we will remember
Through thick and thin we won't surrender
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear we will remember

When the sky is clear we will remember
Through thick and thin we won't surrender
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear we will remember

When the sky is clear we will remember
Through thick and thin we won't surrender
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear we will remember
