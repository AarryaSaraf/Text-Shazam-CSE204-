I can see it all
It gets in my way
Before I end time
I close my eyes

It feels like I could find a place in this mess
And I dream that I'm blind

And I'm weightless when I become the sky

The earth, the moon, the sun beneath me
This is letting go
I'm all over
I reach far and wide

I want to be the one that believes
I feel like I'm part of this mess and I wish

That I'm weightless when I become the sky

The earth, the moon, the sun beneath me
This is letting go
I'm all over
I reach far and wide

The earth, the moon, the sun beneath me
This is letting go
This is on my mind
Let the world be mine
