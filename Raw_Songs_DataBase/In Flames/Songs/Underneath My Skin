Waiting for miracles to appear
All the heights I did aspire
Seems forever gone
A torn and shredded grin to fit the blackened day
Shoveling the ashes from the times of selfish ways

I'm taking more than I can give
Is this the life I wanna live?
The life I wanna live
There's nothing underneath my skin
Is this the life I wanna live?
The life I wanna live

Falling like stars from the sky
Burned out before the trial
And are forever gone
Kneel and pray to find the right way back inside
Been to hell and back but still I feel I'm blind

I'm taking more than I can give
Is this the life I wanna live?
The life I wanna live
There's nothing underneath my skin
Is this the life I wanna live?
The life I wanna live




Is this the life I wanna live?
Is this the life I wanna live?
