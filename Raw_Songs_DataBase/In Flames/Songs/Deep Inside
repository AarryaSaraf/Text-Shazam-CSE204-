Don't you feel the need for change?
The light have died in our eyes
The hatred will consume us
Let's free ourselves from the ties

Deep inside we pray for the flood
A cure to wash it away
Been bound to vicious circles
Ignoring the price we have to pay

I've been searching, I feel worthless
(Have to pay)
I've been searching, I feel worthless

Holding out for something new
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Holding out for something new
Running through the flames
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Release me from your games

Too easy to say, too easy to hate
Never make the same mistakes
Where I'm going I couldn't care
But for you this is where it ends

I've been searching, I feel worthless
(Where it ends)
I've been searching, I feel worthless

Holding out for something new
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Holding out for something new
Running through the flames
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Release me from your games

The light have died
Died in our eyes
Free ourselves
From the ties

Holding out for something new
The lies we try to tell
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Release me from your spell

Holding out for something new
(The lies we try to tell)
Broken dreams and heartbreak
(We retract to our cell)

Holding out for something new
Running through the flames
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Release me from your games
Release me from your games
