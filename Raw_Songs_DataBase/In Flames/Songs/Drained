What we had we threw away
We were close to heaven
But we ended up in hell
What we had we threw away

Just cause the hurt doesn't show
There's no way to recover
You broke my heart in two
I had a dream of growing old
I saw us driving to the end of the road

We had this world of make believe
I thought I saw the fire in your eyes

You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You ripped the heart out of my will to survive
You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You killed the part of me that kept us alive

I'm drained and out of phase
I was shooting straight but you stole my aim
Could have walked for miles
We were supposed to be the end of the line

We had this world of make believe
I thought I saw the fire in your eyes

You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You ripped the heart out of my will to survive
You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You killed the part of me that kept us alive

You killed the part of me that kept us alive

We had this world of make believe
I thought I saw the fire in your eyes

You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You ripped the heart out of my will to survive
You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You killed the part of me that kept us alive

You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You killed the part of me that kept us alive
