How far to go, I never know
I pushed too hard, so you ran away
I know you bleed for me
And you know, oh, I'm dying for you

A journey with open eyes
From darkness to light

The cold is real, that I know
The scars I feel, but I won't let go
I know that I can find the meaning of it all
Put my fears behind before I fall

My will to be something more
Oh, say the right words and be what I've promised
I know you bleed for me
I know I will die for you

A journey with open eyes
From darkness to light

The cold is real, that I know
The scars I feel, but I won't let go (won't let go)
I know that I can find the meaning of it all
Put my fears behind before I fall

Put my fears behind
Put my fears behind
Put my fears behind
Before I fall

The cold is real, that I know
The scars I feel, but I won't let go (won't let go)
I know that I can find the meaning of it all
Put my fears behind before I fall
