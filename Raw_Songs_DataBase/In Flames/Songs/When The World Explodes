I'm right here
When the world explodes
Try to remember these words
When the world explodes

In the darkest of nights
You are my endless fire inside
Across the waters and back to shore
Through space and time
You guide me

Afraid there's not much time
Life's a matter of moments
Face the truth
That I can't outrun
I always known

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know
Dry your eyes
Find the stream that leads to open water
Watch the divine
Come lay with me

Face the truth
That I can't outrun
I always known (I always known)

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know
Dry your eyes
Find the stream that leads to open water
Watch the divine
Come lay with me

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know
Dry your eyes
Find the stream that leads to open water
Watch the divine
Come lay with me
