A perfect storm in a turbulent time
I know my days are numbered
But life seems to end up right
You by my side, my guiding light

Wave goodbye with tearful eyes
Wait for me I won't be long

I wanna tell you before I die
I walked the mile and I'd do it again
The darkness that became me
You're reason I'm still breathing
I walked the mile and I'd do it again

When I was about to breakdown
You took the car heading down south
Dim the lights, I'm going to panic
It's settled, this is forever

Wave goodbye with tearful eyes
Wait for me I won't be long

I wanna tell you before I die
I walked the mile and I'd do it again
The darkness that became me
You're reason I'm still breathing
I walked the mile and I'd do it again

Take away my pain
Take away my sorrow
Save me from tomorrow
Save me!

I wanna tell you before I die
I walked the mile and I'd do it again
The darkness that became me
You're reason I'm still breathing
I walked the mile and I'd do it again
