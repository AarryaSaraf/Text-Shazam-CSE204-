Take a ride from the east in a car with the lease
And bitch you know I'm coming out hard with the top down
Cats want me dead in the street cause I'm hot now
I don't give a fuck about no big mouth
Six want me in the back of the crown
Pussy ass cops wanna roll up on me
But I'm too slick for 'em and they never could call me
I'm the OG man in black, fuck Johnny Cash
Hard to get cause my skin too grimy
Shoutout to the Yardies, gun in the 'Rari
And we  we could throw a party
Riding 'round the city looking for Charles Barkley
Gun up in your mouth, fat nigga speak softly
Said you wanna work for the KKK
Well I got 2 white guns let's get this KKK
Now trust fund kid don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
On Instagram flexin', iPhone textin'
Niggas wanna die over tweets like (woah!)
Section 80 got me so vexed
Wanna try me I'll be on deck
Test me nigga, I'm a dark skin Manson
Arrest me nigga, and you still get these hands son
Price on your head, get the bread for the ransom
Bomb in your car, at your job, at your mansion
I'm singin' the anthem, these guns are the stanzas
You under your bed, you can hide, but you can't run, bitch

JPEG with the lynch mob I got it goin' on
A nigga that's living in the city of the criminal zone
If one time won't keep the law and order
Then next time put a bullet in they daughter
20/20 vision, I see clear
No peace in here, no peace in here
Everybody talking peace, nigga I don't see the peace
So if they want a piece, nigga imma grab the piece
And mob on a trick
Imma be the black Batman on a bitch, real shit son
You know these crackers need they fictional heroes
Cause in real life nigga they don't have none
So shoutout to my niggas on the tracks
And shoutout to all my Dominicans who don't think that they black
And shoutout to my racially ambiguous Latinos who are only minorities when it's convenient for 'em, yeah
