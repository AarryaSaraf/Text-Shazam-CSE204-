Fucking with the six everywhere I go
I got a million dollars but I'll never ever show
If I can't get the  believe I got the 
Riding around my city looking for a baby mother
Seen a girl outside, and I know what she been doing
She alert, I am too, and I know she want that action
Baby I'm sorry, put a refund in the mattress
Baby all my meat got a passion for the flashing baby
Passion of the Christ all around the fucking world
Basking in the lights, diamonds, rubies, fucking pearls
Bitch you know I'm good, everywhere's a fucking show
I can put you on it's all about who you fucking now
So do me a favor and let me be your caper
I'll be your favorite John baby I know you
Don't want it if I cannot afford it
But I want passion over action imma take you on tour, Rich nigga

I know you want it baby
I say I know you want it baby
I know you want it baby
I say I know you want it baby

Get your mind right, nigga get your mind right
Get your mind right, nigga get your mind right
Get your mind right, nigga get your mind right
Get your mind right, nigga get your mind right
Get your mind right, nigga get your mind right
Get your mind right, nigga get your mind right
