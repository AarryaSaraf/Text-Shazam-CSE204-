It's the young alt-right menace
What a pistol to a pennant
Treat a writer like a senate nigga huh
Surface level niggas never get it
Fuck a rating and a cynic
Always talking never living nigga huh
I don't make no music for these niggas
Say they wanna be a critic
But they cannot take no critcism, huh
Nigga we the junkies they the dealers

Oh my God I'm so weak
Holy fuck, I'm lonely
