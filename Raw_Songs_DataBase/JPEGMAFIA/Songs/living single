(You think you know me)
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Oh no you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feelin' this strong
Ooh, boy, you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darlin', 'cause you'll always be my
Ooh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
(Feel bad for this shit)

.44 on me like Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Dressed like a housewife, I'm a bad husband
Keep the fears tucked in (Ah)
Champagne for the pain and sufferin'
Fans same color as voice of Tim Duncan (Wassup)
All these niggas screamin', "Gang," scared to get jumpin'
Nigga them pistols on yo 'Gram s'posed to be tucked in
Chill, watch and observe, Peggy don't say nothin' (Yeah)
Let 'em stay frontin'

Swish, only floaters, wiser, older (Bah)
Sendin' signals to the weirdos, I'm a young smolder
Keep it calm 'cause the skully fit right over my shoulder
I love her, but I can't even hold her (Word)
Tell my baby, "Lie to me," I'm her ayatollah
I'm a hoe, put my whole head in the chocha (Facts)
Little bank that the big bank never noticed
Check my BMI, lil' bitch, I am the sole owner (Uh-huh)
I need royalties, not loyalties, to fill my quota (Gimme that)
They avoiding me, I'm poised to be a rap shogun
Tweet about me all day, you can't be focused
Baby, focus on yourself, 'cause I don't know you
Dark skinned and givin' out work, I feel like Kelly Rowland
I don't need no therapy, beats give me consolin'
I'm gaggin', they still think they know me

It's nasty
