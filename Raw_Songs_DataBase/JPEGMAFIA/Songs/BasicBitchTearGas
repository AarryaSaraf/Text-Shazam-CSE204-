I know, I know, I know, I know (Hahahahaha)
Shit is just, fuck it (Yeah)
(Long Island)  Let's do it

Scrub is a guy who thinks he's fly, and also known as a buster (Yeah)
Always talking' about what he wants and just sits on his broke-ass

So, no (Whoa), I don't want your number
No (Oh), I don't wanna give you mine and
No (Yeah), I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, I don't wanna none of that baby

Scrub checkin' me and his game is kinda week
And I know that he cannot approach me
Lookin' like class, and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get with a deadbeat ass, oh

I don't want no scrub
Scrub is a guy who can't get no love from me
It ain't hard to see, he
