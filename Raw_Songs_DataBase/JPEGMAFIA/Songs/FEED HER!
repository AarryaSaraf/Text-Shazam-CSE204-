I'm at the crib with no money, no bitch and no guns, boy, what is you doin' with me?
I be looking at these children like, "What is you doin'?" It must be the boomer in me
Words pop out these niggas, yes, I know they pussy as fuck and we never gon' meet
Your beats like my Kimber, the shit never jam, nigga, I'm used to the heat (Facts)
These niggas don't know how to score, they just setting the screen
Fuck what you do for the others, boy, what is you doing for me?
How do I stay in your mind, lil' bitch, and we still ain't meet?
My bitch same color as Dave East
I put pause on a nigga like me
I spit bars like I never get sleep
How did I move in your mind rent-free?
Huh, taxing a lease, I think I'm Prince Ali
You minimum wage, I'm Prince Hakeem
It's dirty, you alt-right trolls ain't worthy
I stay in your mind, it's workin' (Uh)
You have no worth, it's hurtin'
Don't know any niggas in person (Nah)
Never step outside, just lurkin' (Ooh, ooh-yeah)

Oh, that's you, I be for certain
My Kimber my main bitch, but, yeah, me and my Glock be flirtin'
Be careful where you stay, I left my prints, stay nervous
Stand back, stand by, stay learning, uh
When one of these crackers get brave and I put Kimbers to their face
Y'all better thank me for my service
My world different, I'm Kyrie Irving
Niggas be bitchin', they have no purpose
Testing my patience, I'm going to search you
Running a clinic and feeding the nurses
Miracle bars, you wrapping a turban
Noble savage, I'm Maria Minerva
Baby, I feel like a servant
It's not like I don't deserve it
Patience, trust, gotta earn it
Grab my baby, came back to this curvy
I feel as dripped and I'm nervous
How, how
How it feels when I bring up your memory
Ooh, you feelin' me now, keep callin' me from his house
The pressure on pile, all these sticks, I just can't put it down
Now I hear 'bout my name in your mouth
All that money, he still on my couch
What that smell like? Bars
I'm a thot that was never in doubt
They love me 'cause I spin on them messy
They fuck you 'cause you giving them clout
Fuck a girl, make a beat on my couch
On the road to some riches, I'm laughing
'Cause I keep running into your- (Uh)
How I keep running into your exes?
I keep texting, know she get the message
Feed her
