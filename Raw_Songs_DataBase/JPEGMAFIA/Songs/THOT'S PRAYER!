Thank you, Jesus
Oh, thank you, Je- Thank you, Jesus

Makes me feel real good inside, you know, all that green baby
I like to- I like to hold that green, I hold it up
Play with it a little bit, you know, count it once in a while
This, this, oh
Insecure

My loneliness is killing me inside
I must confess (I must), I still believe in drive
Give me a sign
My loneliness is killing me inside
I must confess, I still believe in drive
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
That it's mine
Hit me (Hit me), baby
One more time
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Uh, for the resolution, the color, the science of them
Everything about JPEGs, I like

Yeah, I ain't relaxed yet (Nah)
Takin' a break from these albums, I'm gassin' (I'm gassin')
Yet my skills is past that (Yeah)
They talkin' down, we've been lookin' right at that
They think I can't match that (Yeah)
Peggy too real for these games and we past that
Talkin' 'bout smack (Smack)
And you niggas ain't did shit about it, what's that?
Are you thirsty? Are you lost? Are you dumb? Bitch, where you at?
Carmen Sandiego all on this map
You lied to the Lord, and you lied through these apps
Your man got the two piece, 'cause you'll get the MAC
Don't stop lyin' (Don't do it)
I get stuck in the past, get to cryin'
Then remember my path, get to rhymin'
Hah, it doesn't get better

My loneliness is killing me inside
I must confess, I still believe in drive
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
That it's mine
Hit me, baby
One more time, oh
Oh, baby, baby
Uh, hit me
Oh, baby, baby
