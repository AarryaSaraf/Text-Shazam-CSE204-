"But the support we're getting from the African-American community has been overwhelming, and I wanna thank each and every one of you..."
Shit...

Maybe I'm stuck in my ways
Fantasies, fantasies, fantasies
I should rap like Sly Tendencies
Obviously, I'm who I meant to be (Facts)
My leader treat me like an enemy, he a casualty
Wonder if he cry when he see fans of me
Can't believe we thought he'd be the man for me
It's sad, for real, melody
When we fuckin' you better pretend to be
Gotta keep that on-brand positioning
No surprises, you know its the bends with me
Now halt, niggas dyin', you know it's y'all fault
People pray for the press to impeach
Deeper down, know that vote is a loss
It's sad (Yeah)

(Yeah, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh, oh, no no, yeah
Ayy, I don't got nothin' to say to remember this shit
Uh)

MAGA raps, caught a body in a MAGA hat (Yeah)
Who try get rid of me? Let my bottom bitches handle that
Nah, baby, I don't wanna go (Ah)
Made men make it look close, fuck the polls
Change the language when they decipher the code
Flip the script, now the caption is closed
Vice City, used to print all my codes
Strap on my hip 'cause I'm bitter and old
Mountain Dew sippers, they hatin' the scroll (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bunker bitch decoratin' his home (Uh)
Black man got it sowed
Get the money, y'all can keep all the hope
Rich, all my enemies is broke
Big bank and we rakin' in more (Yee)
Off a probation, them cases is closed (Woo)
I'ma tell we like Trump told you
Fuck it, nigga, what we got to lose?
Ain't gon' be no peace with the crew
'Cause it's one piece we gon' aim at you

(Fuck Trump)
