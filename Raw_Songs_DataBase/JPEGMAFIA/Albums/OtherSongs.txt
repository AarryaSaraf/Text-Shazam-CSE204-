[redveil:]
Uh

In the sun, I ain't black enough
Oh, some funds got him acting up?
Nigga, jump in the aqueduc
Niggas know that you wack as fuck
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough

Who been putting in minimal pain?
Already showed 'em it's up and it's stuck
Wear my scars, who the fuck is ashamed?
Never me, I'ma keep it a buck
You get charred if you step in my range
So you might as well stay in the cut
I ain't Midas, but stain what I touch
I ain't hiding, I came in to crush, bitch
Who told that black boy had to hate himself?
Who told my sister she ain't worth a cent?
Grin on my face from watching crackers melt
Stand on that shit, boy, I cannot pretend
Niggas ain't spillin' tears when karma dealt
I'm just gon' play a little violin
I ain't gon' water down just for some wealth, bitch

In the sun, I ain't black enough
Oh, some funds got him acting up?
Nigga, jump in the aqueduc
Niggas know that you wack as fuck
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Man, they said I ain't black enough, maybe 'cause I don't act enough
Niggas out here be acting tough, I don't put on a act for none
I came through like a glitch in the game (What?), talk my shit and I backed it up
They'll still say I ain't black enough, they'll still say I ain't black enough (Uh)
This won't last, three, four tabs, I get to acting up
Man, this cookout is packed as fuck, with these crackers y'all asked to lunch
That's the beauty of backing it up (What's up?), is my niggas don't ask for nothing?
Rather bring out the Source Awards, (For real), then they hit up a GRAMMY brunch, huh
I know these niggas ain't seein' me, these niggas never believe in me
I know the stakes, I know the real from the fake, opinion from media takes
I'm at a stage, work like it's minimum wage, for money and critical praise
Fuck out the way, you better watch what you say
Your black life won't matter today, nigga

[redveil:]
Black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough

(Dah, dah, dah-dah)

"Darlin' I
I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl, it's driving me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go"
"Can we go back to the day that I was [?]
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes on?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back to the way they used to be?
Oh God give me the reason I'm [?] abandon me"
Uh, nah

Where's your bitch?
Damn, I took her
Ok, what up
Ok, what up
Don't just run up
Gotta put the gun up
Ok what up
Grind 'til the son up
All black Hummer?
Smokin' on stunna
Too stone cold get froze by fridgidair
K visionairs got flare from the gutter
All black timbs and potato
Bread butters
Stompin' your click
I do shit that you could've
Ok, what up
It's no other
Still with the gang but I'm solo, brother
Funny how black is
Considered as colored
Ok, what up
Ok, what up
Butchy, baby
Don't lose yourself
You would do you if you knew yourself
But you're doing niggas like the man
Still catching heat like a tan
Ok, what up
What's the plan?
We mobbin', we robbin', we raging? Damn
I aim at you scholars my shit won't jam
Then hand with my partners
Yeah, that's the fam

(In this motherfucker)

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Moonwalk on a nigga face
Slap your man then catch the 8th
2Chainz on my side piece
I know real shottas
They don't fuck with Drake
Telling on me cause I'm keeping pace
Sus boys always take the bait
Sissy niggas got no hope
Hitting high notes when they catch a case
Damn boy, how much bread you made?
Veteran but you never paid
Trinidadian or Dominican
I'm protected when I'm going out of state
Double up, bitch I guess I'm mass
Real ass but the hair fake
Once again I'm in another state
With another gun
In your nigga face
Call me Mikey dread
Sippin' suda fed
Whoop a nigga like case then
Talking to the feds
HIt 'em with lead
Take his picture like a liscense
This expensive shit
A different kind of lick
My trigger finger itching
Right hand
Fuck a scraper boy
Like him
I'm spinning on him like bison

[Freaky:]
I'm no Bounty, Paper towel
Ay, ow
Spin [?] on myself
Side of me make you say
Boy, you [?] make you say
Boy, you love [?] self
I don't know a God dang thing about mental health

// call me maybe //

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
Trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way
I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But now it's in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot nights, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?
I like the motion all night
I was stroking take time out of stroking
Where do you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Girl you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
Missed you missed you so bad
Girl you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you baby, I missed baby

Girl you came into my life
I missed you so bad

// Does This Ski Mask Make Me Look Fat? //

I've named this one JPEG

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Uh, no debit, I want credit, these dudes actors
Straight jackers, never learned to be a rapper, kill masters
Ice white like Casper, all these pussy niggas passive
JPEG presentation

Garçon, Garçon, Garçon, Garçon
Does this ski mask make me look fat?

And I'm fresh out the bag, on my life, yeah
Nigga, go on bust a sag, on my life

Uh, my homie told me, "Kick that Super Saiyan as long as it can cell"
25 packs on the real, I feel like another spoke on the wheel
Two kills, one shot, the crack rock hit your face like Botox
I won't stop you on 4chan, bitch, I got the fo' cocked
And when I pull it you gonna call cops, hoe stop
I'm on the coast now, niggas playing with the Peg, no sound
Rappers coming at me smoking on that PCP
Fuck around and end up on Smack DVD
I wonder if my momma ever seen me cheese
Nigga, I been wild ever since I passed my CDCs, 25 cities in a row
I'm switching up the coast, give my ego some hope, I tell 'em

No debit, I want credit, these dudes actors
Straight jackers, never learned to be a rapper
I kill masters, bringing math to disasters
Toe-tagging, ice white like Casper
Flow tragic, you should pick another tactic
I'm so ratchet, all these pussy niggas passive
I'm too graphic, more blunt ashes
Nigga, fuck your fabric, you average

[Heno.:]
All the pain and suffering was temporary
Nowadays, I swear that they was never ready
For me coming from nothing to get it varied
Determined to prove that I would be legendary (sheesh)
I only got one life to live, yeah
But I'm gonna do whatever's necessary
Until I'm dead and buried up in the cemetery
All that other shit is secondary to me
I put that on my life, that's word to my momma
That's why I grind and I serve for them commas
Because that's what it's like being birthed from the bottom, ayy
I know you heard that I'm poppin', ayy
Came from the dirt now I got it, ooh
No way on Earth that I'm stopping, no
Quit trying to ride on my wave, yeah, like I'ma surf in the tropics

[JPEGMAFIA:]

[Heno:]
Fuck your fabric, you average, fuck all your fabric, you average
All of these niggas is passive, they pussy, they better pick tactics
Learn to be rappers, I swear these dudes is some actors
Pussies is passive, niggas is passive Ha-ha

[Dyyo Faccina:]
Can't keep my dick in my pants
So fucked up I just spilled my drink on my manz

I roll up a stoge
And I don't give a fuck bout your stance

People only see the surface
Peace can be your purpose
Peep the potency of me it's perfect
Fuck with me its worth it

And If you do
You can get residuals
All you individuals is pitiful
You'll never be original

Your the typical type
You stuck on your digital hype
Ain't shit without political ties
If you ask me
You got wack beats and despicable rhymes
Worthless

I'm the vaccine for your medical purpose
Fuck with me and its worth it
I'm a lyrical circus
While Your shit is as boring
As episcopal church's

Ain't no need to be nervous
I got the heat in the furnace

// Kid Rock Freestyle 2014 //

We all know exactly who I am
Only in L.A. (Yeah)
Who the hell are you?

Stick up kid on a rooftop
I scope a dead man while he still breathe (Naw Bitch)
No tax on it, it's a flat rate
Flatline and get (future get the fucking duct tape)
I'm the anti-Slim Shady
White Trash in my yard, get the gat, Baby
You get popped on the curb, feel the fire
While I deny my identity, Bitch, I'm Bill Myer
Bloody mask and a gold ring
Choke a politician out, it's a Black thing

Niggas yelling action but I'm not actin'
Rednecks hanging from a tree while I'm laughin'
Say my name
Indistinguishable vocal sample
Niggas know I'm too hot to handle
Hit the drive-by on the Hollywood sign
Straight dumpin' out the roof screaming "Fuck Lee Daniels"

Keep thinkin' they your friends
Keep thinkin' they your friends
Keep thinkin' they your friends, nigga [x3]

I don't wanna be a star
I just wanna grip a 5th, shoot a cop car
Kid Rock called, said he was a rockstar
The check ran out, he ain't Black anymore
Fake Cracker from Detroit talkin' stupid
I got a full clip for that diet Ted Nugent
White Trash Icon, Wigga-fied pussy
Put yo head on a stick, fuck nigga don't push me
Strapped to the T, guns in the air
I hope you shoot well 'cause bitch, I ain't a deer
Wiggas talk shit 'til the shit gets real
This ain't a diss, White boy, you gettin' killed
You was in the house, Cracker, I was in the field
I got a sixth sense, smell a Trust Fund Kid like a meal
So fuck Lynyrd Skynyrd, fuck your flag and [?]
Watch your mouth or I'll send your pussy ass up to Cracker Heaven (Bitch, BITCH)

Keep thinkin' they your friends
Keep thinkin' they your friends
Keep thinkin' they your friends, nigga [x3]

I might rob a bank
Cause I got a tank
High up in the ranks
I might rob a bank
Cause a nigga broke
But you smoke a lot of stank
What the fuck you think?
I don't give a fuck
Had that nina tuck
Crashed the party up
Put them fingers up
Jerry Springer'd up
And stick the lobby up

I was in the crib
Grubbin' on some ribs
Fuckin' on your bitch
That's when I got a call
From my nigga Josh
He said he need a job
Push that shorty off
I told my nigga Josh, "Look here, I'm with you, dog"
We wasn't getting paid
It started as a joke
Like we can rob a bank? (one, two)

I might rob a bank

Robbed the bank now we
Slidin' cross the interstate
Ridin' kush to the face
That candle lit like dinner dates
Smoke the shit like andale
How I smoke so much
When the rent is late
How I pull that out my ass
I swear the boy is like Cirque Du Soleil
Hip hip hooray
I fill a soda with xans
Pour a cup to my man
Sanji
Break the damn beat up
Like it's Pangea
Sing it to it like Mari Maria
Lean in my sangria
Blood on my Adidas
Icy like margaritas

Got a new gun that bitch fat and privileged

Iliza Shlesinger when I get the hammer
Bang bang shooting at the shooters
Form it up like clayface
Then I'm swingin' on 'em like Batman
The front door won't open up
We gon' have to hit the back
Sticking up Hilary for her chips
Before I vote for her
Robbing my bank
She said I overdraft too much for her
I whip a tank
5 star GTA
Fuck up off me
Queen Latifah Cheefah
But these pigs ain't set it offing me
Joanne how I scam the courthouse
Judge said I got 30 days in the pen
Told him, "Fuck that, I ain't going back in"
Grab his left wrist, take his watch, then I scram
Robbing niggas, stalling niggas
If the cops come then we dodging niggas
Straight licks fuck a hostage, nigga
I need all that money in my pocket, nigga

// Stairwell Freestyle //

Check it
Any left wing motherfucker trying to be your friend is an enemy
Don't believe in his frenemy tactics
These niggas do backflips to get a pat on the head
You step to me and you're dead
Get your liberal ass kicked
Same bitch memorized every Chief Keef verse
The same one to call the cops
Think you want to steal her purse
It hurts to say this
Niggas think they doing favors but these hipster motherfuckers
Wanna steal all our creations and claim credit for 'em
Rewrite history, Chuck Berry to Elvis
Make our shit a mystery, rock, blues, techno, soul, jazz, and R&B
What do they have in common?
Niggas started it, now they barely have a part in it
Now some kids wanna be a fireman, a doctor
A rapper, a ball player, even a fucking dog watcher
Go to the NFL, be a teacher or a chemist
Make an app for iPhone and get paid for your inventions
But think real hard, think one long minute
I never heard one kid say they wanna be a critic
See, that's every single hipster's backup plan
They failed at everything else, they need some backup, man
They spend all their parents' money
All their trust fund cash, and flunk out
And these are the niggas y'all let run rap, God damn
See, these 90's babies scared to talk shit
So if I gotta be that nigga I'mma be that nigga, call you out
Grimes vinyl in a beartrap, I'mma draw you out
Take you in the back of an alley somewhere and maul you out
Then hop up in my whip and tell you to gentrify this dick
You hipster bitch
Fuck outta here, man

One eye open
Like a cyclops
Ran out of work
Hit the trap spot
44 tucked in the boot
Hash oil all in the coupe
I ain't got a coupe

[JPEGMAFIA:]
I'm almost of sauce with it
Bitch I'm almost out of sauce
I can't take a loss
Fuck Hugo I'm a boss
I got the juice
City on my back
Like it's a noose
You been stealing swag
I don't approve
I been in my bag
I got the truth
Rolie on my arm
But not like you
You gon end up dead
Out on the news
Cause your a moor
Fighting these demons and gods
Cause your a moor
Oh, I see it
Yeah, where the rappers at?

Yeah
I can't pay no taxes
I can't pay no taxes
I can't pay my taxes
Fuck these taxes mane
Fuck...
Fuck these taxes

[Enso:]
Still [*beep*] all night
Double park the PT Cruiser
I am feeling like ruler
On the beat I am the bruiser
I'm just a star I'm gon run it up
I am just saying I swag on em
I had to bring out that bag on em
I know that didn't make no sense
But I make dollars I don't make no cents

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Spit something real quick for the niggas on the westside!

[Enso:]
Aye, you hear the beat my nigga
Bunch of motherfuckers hating
I ain't here for debating
I am so hot when I'm whipping
Niggas be thinking I'm Cajun
You niggas played
These motherfuckers been plotting for days
But I swear...
All that money been spent
Real nigga tryna pay the rent
Aye, I didn't think it would be so weird
Spitting in the middle of the suburbs
In front of white people and shit...

// THE BENDS! //

"But the support we're getting from the African-American community has been overwhelming, and I wanna thank each and every one of you..."
Shit...

Maybe I'm stuck in my ways
Fantasies, fantasies, fantasies
I should rap like Sly Tendencies
Obviously, I'm who I meant to be (Facts)
My leader treat me like an enemy, he a casualty
Wonder if he cry when he see fans of me
Can't believe we thought he'd be the man for me
It's sad, for real, melody
When we fuckin' you better pretend to be
Gotta keep that on-brand positioning
No surprises, you know its the bends with me
Now halt, niggas dyin', you know it's y'all fault
People pray for the press to impeach
Deeper down, know that vote is a loss
It's sad (Yeah)

(Yeah, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh, oh, no no, yeah
Ayy, I don't got nothin' to say to remember this shit
Uh)

MAGA raps, caught a body in a MAGA hat (Yeah)
Who try get rid of me? Let my bottom bitches handle that
Nah, baby, I don't wanna go (Ah)
Made men make it look close, fuck the polls
Change the language when they decipher the code
Flip the script, now the caption is closed
Vice City, used to print all my codes
Strap on my hip 'cause I'm bitter and old
Mountain Dew sippers, they hatin' the scroll (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bunker bitch decoratin' his home (Uh)
Black man got it sowed
Get the money, y'all can keep all the hope
Rich, all my enemies is broke
Big bank and we rakin' in more (Yee)
Off a probation, them cases is closed (Woo)
I'ma tell we like Trump told you
Fuck it, nigga, what we got to lose?
Ain't gon' be no peace with the crew
'Cause it's one piece we gon' aim at you

(Fuck Trump)

// The Who //

Mmm, ooh, I look the best with this hue (Hue)
I am a vegetable too (Mmm)
I got a million in profit (Listen)
I brought them decimals through (Phew, phew)
Blessings for you (Ahh)
I write a hit while I'm takin' a deuce
Upload and get 20 views (Not a game)
I'm in the struggle for real
You know I struggle with truth (Set!)
I should get killed for my views
But I won't cause I'm a- (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, they don't wan' see me lose
Fuck I'ma do? I'ma sell out like The Who
(You think you know me)

I used to dream, but now it all seems
So pointless to me, when I'll never be
(Hit while I'm takin' a deuce
Upload and get 20 views)
But really, these are the lies that I tell myself
Leave me alone, I don't need your help (Ayy, ayy)
Give him the time, soon I'll be alright
I'll dream again, or will I?
I used to (Ooh)

Ooh, I look the best with the shoes
I am a vegetable too
I got a million in profit
So I brought them decimals through (Mmm, ha)
Blessings for you
I write a hit while I'm takin' a deuce
Upload and get 20 views (Not a game)
I'm in the struggle for real
You know I struggle with truth (Set!)
I should get killed for my views
But I won't cause I'm a- (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, they don't wan' see me lose (Phew, phew)
Fuck I'ma do? I'ma sell out like The Who

I wrote this song on a bus, now I'm bummin' in a coupe
You just hate the way I move, catch your du- after school
Amazon Prime with the new Glock, one click and it used
You think you're special because you can levi-duh-levi-duh
Damn (Damn), ooh (Ooh), no tax for a tool
I write a blog on a bitch, don't care about who
I don't really want to, y'all already know how I do
Baby, all I wanna see is you

I used to love, but I was never enough
For anyone's time, not even mine
Not even mine

// THIS SONG IS A SAFE SPACE //

[JPEGMAFIA:]
I don't wanna cry no more, yah
I don't wanna die no more, yah
Cause I don't wanna rap no more

When white people rap I think of suicide (Cuck, cuck)
Heard your track bro, now I wanna die (Cuck, cuck, cuck)
Tats on my face I'm so fucking pie [?] (Cuck)
Imma turn the damn trap into Columbine (Cuck)
Where my deal at? Where my steel at?
Boy I kill cacs, [?]
I ain't a rapper bruh
I don't feel that
I'm just a cracker bro
Get hated everywhere I go
I pulled up on a trust fund kid
Made him beg for his iPhone 6
I know his momma paid all that shit
I caught that cracker with a banzai kick
I take snaps when I hit that lick
I'm too cold when I'm sipping on the apple berry
I change modes when I'm kicking it with Katy Perry's
My black soul ain't enough for me to make a living
White girl got an ass like Meg Griffin
I told that bitch to grab a fork and hit the damn kitchen
Bust a nut up on her face and call it reparitions (hold up) reparations
My reputation got me banned from all of your fucking safe spaces
All them pronouns you still racist

[Freaky:]
They don't wanna be white anymore
They don't wanna be white anymore
They're more than just white now

Swagger

I got a white boy I think I finna tat his face
Got (a) white boy who rap I think he's trans-race
I know an asian girl with cornrolls she says cause she based
I know a white girl with grills she says it's cause she's from the bay
I know a white girl who think she ain't cause she speak "ándale"
I know white people who think they very fond of me
I know white people rap only cause the economy
(They don't wanna be white anymore)
(They're more than just white now)

Facetime my white boy
Facetime his white mom
Face palm his white (d) ad
Face fuck my white girl
Facetime her white dad
Facetime my white girl
Facetime her white mom
Facepalm his white dad
Facefuck my white boy
Facetime her white mom

When white people rap I think of suicide (suicide)
When white people rap, feel like I've lost some shit that's mine (I lost my mind)
When white people rap I feel like it's not mine (I lost my mind)
When white people rap they make a pretty (dime) (I wanna cry)

[Black Sheep Refugees:]
[?]

[Buffalo:]
I don't wanna lie no more
I don't have to try no more
I can never cry no more
[?]

I don't even wanna hear a white nigga speak
I don't ever wanna see a white nigga teach
If me and a white nigga ever meet
I'ma turn his ass into...
Dark Meat!
Food ass niggas
Make a nigga wanna eat
Fruity ass niggas
Make a nigga want beef

[Drug Dillon aka Deej Cokane:]
Fucking white boys keep wearing shark teeth

[Buffalo:]
Niggas talk money
But I know that talk cheap
You gon learn today
If you try and chalk me

[Farraji:]
Bitch you better pray
Before you try and cross me

[Buffalo:]
You just hardly living
I'm just killing softly

[Farraji:]
Snatch you at that starbucks
While you drinking coffee
Catch you in the club
While you dancing off beat

[Buffalo:]
All of us in the VIP
Some of us in here
All fake I.D.'s
Shallow ass niggas know
We came here deep

[Drug Dillon aka Deej Cokane:]
Grew up on a farm
And you used to heard sheep
But we the black sheep
White sheep
Can't beat

[Farraji:]
Soon as I roll my weed
They wanna hang by me
I'm not the type of nigga
You can hang by tree
Bitch I'll beat your ass
Like my name Ali

[Mikey S]
And I'll get you laid under a white sheet
Shoutout JPEG man this a nice beat!

[Black Sheep Refugees:]
We hate ya'll
We hate ya'll
We hate ya'll
We hate ya'll

[Farraji:]
We hate ya'll

[Mikey S:]
Ahhooohh

Kurt
Man

Why the fuck you say that shit you say if you ain't mean it?
I don't believe it
She bumpin' Brent but she black as Ben Carson (Yeah-yeah)
Back in the bricks, I was givin' dick to all my sergeants (Yeah-yeah)
I know you mad 'cause your friends ain't no Gs (Not at all)
And we got straps as big as Dugg in my apartment (One, one)
Keep it on the hip, when I load the clip I'ma blow the cartridge (Bah)
And aim that heat at your garments, boy

What about that shit you said them years when I was broke? (Yeah)
And what about buyin' a ticket to get beat up at my show? (Yeah, yeah)
The opposition sick of me, tired, nervous, and broke (Word)
You thought that I forgot but bitch, I'm never letting go
I got 'em on the ropes (Huh?)
Hit him hard, swing it left and get em gone (Uh)
Pick him up, dust him off, give him some more (Uh)
All my opps sick, tired, nervous, and broke
And they still take me as some j— (Man, huh?)
Now, are you feelin' me, baby, or do you need it more?
I keep straight faces like Casey whenever I'm in court
I can't keep making fire, I never pass the torch (Yeah)
Lil' Bruce Wayne, I'm so special with it
Beyond your reach tryna big up all these Terry McGinnis
Black Canelo puttin' on a clinic (Yeah)
They don't know how I'm doin' it, still stuck on how I did it, weak

I wish I would sidechain that kick to a beat, bitch, please
That's shit you need, bum!
Complete
Hmm

Why the fuck I'm still here walking 'round if you a demon?
See? (Mm-mm) I don't believe it (Not at all)
When I shoot my shit, I don't never miss, bet I hit hit my target (Yeah-yeah)
And they gonna learn quick, I'm the wrong nigga to start with it (Yeah-yeah)
I know why you hate, 'cause you don't feel safe in your own apartment (Nah)
I know why you hate, 'cause you know you lame even though you balling (Check it out)
Yeah, I see the bitch in you niggas, I know that's common (Uh)
The money can't change how a bitch nigga started (Check it out)
End up makin' threats (Yeah), start off paying homage (Shocked)
Caught for possession, I feel like Sarah McLachlan (Brrah)
Bitch, drop your nuts, I'm tired of tweetin' and talking
Pretty socks, big Glocks, bitch, I'm with the nonsense, come here
Uh

What about that shit you said that year when I was broke? (Yeah)
And what about buyin' a ticket to get beat up at my show? (Yeah, yeah)

You're selfish like me
