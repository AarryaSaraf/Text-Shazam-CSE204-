// At A Later Date //

Why must we be put down when we try to get away?
Why must we all grow up when we could just play and play?
Good things in life are free, can't buy everything, that's true
Only one thing wrong with that, what it don't buy I don't use

Only thing I'm thinking of is "Why are we all here?"
There must be more to do at night than drinking rotten beer
The world's a very shady place, and you can't trust a soul
"Grin and bear it" seemed the thing, when it just gets a hold
At a later date - it might come out a fright
At a later date - I hope that you're alright

Human beings are dangerous and they call me in the dark
But everything gets twice as cold in marching for a lark
There's loads of things I'd like to do if I could find the time
Working really tires me and I think I'll turn to crime
At a later date - I hope they start it soon
At a later date - before we hit the moon

I just can't be bothered to make an effort here at all
People make you feel your contributions are too small
At a later date - I'll be awful great
At a later date - someone somewhere blew it
At a later date - at a later date

// Gutz //

Warsaw!

Don't talk to me girl - you know it's not nice
Don't laugh at murder - I won't pay the price
The facts are too high-powered - it's such a big thrill
I'd do it myself, 'cause it makes you so ill

Blame bad things on me, whatever you do
When I come home my world is different from you
You're such a chic tart - you're really dressed up
Don't wanna talk to you - just left with your mum

Don't be a puppet - always rush you around
One just for your photo - try and tie me down
I won't tell him I talk like this all night
He must be worried 'cause you're sounding so trite

Respect is only normal - the way to your lives
Ever tried to sleep around - once I begged for a wife
Wouldn't have to change you - start acting that way
If we don't keep our heads alive, I'll never get a say
You know what's special - it's as black as I say
Can you see me, just ourselves - no comment, copycat!

// In A Lonely Place //

Caressing the marble and stone,
Love that was special for one,
The waste in the fever I heat,
How I wish you were here with me now.

Body that curls in and dies,
And shares that awful daylight,
Warm like a dog round your feet,
How I wish you were here with me now.

Hangman looks round as he waits,
Cord stretches tight then it breaks,
Someday we will die in your dreams,
How I wish we were here with you now.

// Inside The Line //

Hey you! You too!
I could make the choice for you
Dirt sticks close to you - it's all around me
Everything I try to do
I can't even seem to find the room to move

But you think you're number one
Actors though the film has gone
Crowded in a room for one
Darkness when the lights are on
Turn me on for good - it's so exciting
Slogans on the wall don't need no advertising
I can't even seem to find the room to move

Shackled up in fantasy
Hoping for some time to breathe
Suffocation comes too easy
I just want some time to breathe
Dirt sticks close to you - it's all around me
Everything I do - they're always trying to crowd me
I can't even seem to find the room to move

Watching every move I make
Choice of one that's hard to take
In fact it's just a big mistake
The effects that make it feel like you
Maggots run inside the line
Ready for the perfect crime
Say there is no right or wrong
I don't know what's right or wrong
I don't know what's right or wrong

// The Drawback (All Of This For You) //

Seen the troubles and the evils of this world
I've seen the stretches between godliness and sin
I've had the promise and confessions of true faith
And the hypocrisy that always lies within
And they left it for you - all of this for you -

I've seen the products and the other world of waste
I've seen the colour of corruption deep within
I've seen them lose themselves in dignity and taste
To see in black and white and through to black again
And they left it for you - all of this for you -

And they left it for you - all of this for you
And they left it for you - everything for you
I've seen the troubles and the evils of this world
I've seen the ones who can succeed but always lose
I've seen what's left of poor technology and work
And watched them dying as they leave their ship of fools
And they left it for you - all of this for you -

// You're No Good For Me //

Don't know what I'm doing - don't know where I'm going
Leading me to ruin - I should have traded you in
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me

Don't know if I care - don't know if I'm there
I just sit and stare - making love to thin air
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me
Na na na na na na na na no good -

I do lots of good - surprised at what you would
Don't call me no crud - I really think I'm good
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me

Try to call the tune - I'll probably go and rue it
I'll just get it groomed - all sorts of other clues
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me

I get by the local peer group and their pressures
I can wash the dishes - my soups can taste delicious
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me

I've forgotten how you feel - to me you're looking real
Come on let's make a deal - think of where you live
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me
Na na na na na na na na no good -

I've forgotten how you feel - to me you're looking real
Come on let's make a deal - think of what you need
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me
