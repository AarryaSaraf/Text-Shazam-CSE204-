Impossible

I never listen to nevers
I don't make use for howevers
I can make it through whatever
I got here 'cause I am clever
It's taken me to new levels
Just call me "Hood Cinderella"
Glass slipper fits my new ego

'Cause the world full of pain
Redemption is my name
It's all for those who claim
Who feel we are the same
The world's full of Satan's fools
God takes care of 'em too
For those breakin' all the rules
All the rules

Impossible things
Are happening every day
Impossible things
Are happenin' every day
Impossible things

I split the skies, change the weather
I bring the oceans together
Just watch me fly without feathers
That's how you make perfect better
It's whatever, now or never
Never blink, never think when they tell you "no"
'Cause that'll be the dirt that helps you grow

'Cause the world full of pain
Redemption is my name
It's all for those who claim
Who feel we are the same
The world's full of Satan's fools
God takes care of 'em too
For those breakin' all the rules
All the rules

Impossible things (Impossible things)
Are happening every day (Are happenin' every day)
Impossible things (Impossible things)
Are happenin' every day (Are happenin' every day)
Impossible things (Impossible things)
Are happenin' every day (Are happenin' every day)
Impossible things (Impossible things)
Are happenin' every day (Are happenin' every day)
Impossible things

Uh, outside  where a little girl earned her stripes
OG's tellin' me I need to read to write
On the TV, murder rate just goin' through the roof
 sendin' me to the store for juice
All the workers at the Kroger know me by my name
Barber shop, nail shop, hair shop, the same
They say, "Leikeli, baby, when you make it big, come back"
That's why I named my first three albums after all of that
Wash & Set, Acrylic, Shape Up, you could check the facts
I just put on for the hood after all of that
Wash & Set, Acrylic, Shape Up, you could check the facts
I just put on for the hood, uh
