This is for the lovers holding hands in the car
This is for the lovers, no matter where you are
This is for you (It's for you, it's for you, it's for you)
This is for you (It's for you, it's for you)
This is for the lovers just getting on their feet
This is for the lovers 'bout twenty years deep
This is for you (It's for you, it's for you, it's for you)
This is for you (It's for you, it's for you)
Oh yeah

It's a beautiful thing
When it's shared between two
The most beautiful thing about it
That it's so much more than you
There ain't nothing in the world like being with your lover
Nothing in the world like seeing one another
Happy with the one you need the most, yeah, ahh

I know somebody's gonna make love to this song tonight
Tonight, tonight
I know somebody's out of town
And they're calling home tonight
Let me tell you what they're sayin' right now
They're sayin'

It ain't hard to tell when it's something real
You can have the world, all you want is them
Even when you're in a crowd
And you're spotted from a mile and
That's when you know love is worth it

When it's going wrong, and you never give up
When you're on the phone, you never hang up
Even when you're feeling down
They can always make you smile and
That's when you know love is worth it

This is for the lovers holding hands in the car
(Holding hands in the car)
This is for the lovers, no matter where you are
(No matter where you are)
This is for you (It's for you, it's for you, it's for you)
This is for you (It's for you, it's for you)
This is for you, baby

Some people feel it, they let it show
Some people miss it, they let it go
Some people doubt it, I'ma tell you now
They don't know a thing about it
That's why they doubt it

Some people give it, some people take it
Some people try to but they can't fake it
That's why when it's official, you just can't walk away
And you can trust me when I say

I know somebody's gonna make love to this song tonight
Tonight, tonight
I know somebody's out of town
And they're calling home tonight
Let me tell you what they're sayin' right now
They're sayin'

It ain't hard to tell when it's something real
(When it's something real)
You can have the world (Oh), all you want is them
Even when you're in a crowd

That's when you know love is worth it

When it's goin' wrong (Yeah), you never give up
(You never give up)
When you're on the phone (Oh), you never hang up
Even when you're feeling down
They can always make you smile and
That's when you know love is worth it

This is for the lovers holding hands in the car (Oh)
This is for the lovers, no matter where you are
This is for you (You) (It's for you, it's for you, it's for you)
This is for you (It's for you, it's for you, oh baby, ah)
This is for the lovers just getting on their feet

This is for the lovers 'bout twenty years deep
This is for you (It's for you, it's for you, it's for you)
