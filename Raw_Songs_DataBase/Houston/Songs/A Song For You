I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs and made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my live on stages with ten thousand people watching
Well, we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

I know your image of me is what I hoped to be
I've treated you unkindly, but darling, can't you see?
There's no one more important to me?
Baby, can't you see through me?
We're alone now, and I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets of a true love withholding nothing
(Withholding nothing)
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better, and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody (The melody) 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time (Space or time)
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, oh, remember when we were together
(We were together)
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

This song is for you (This song, this song)
This song is for you (This song, this song)
This song is for you (This song, this song)
This song is for you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you

I love you in a place, my dear friend
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, ah, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone (We were alone) and I was singing this song to you

We were alone, and I was singing this song to you
We were alone (Yeah, yeah), and I was singing this song
Oh yeah, singing this song (Singing this song)
I was singing this song, just for you
