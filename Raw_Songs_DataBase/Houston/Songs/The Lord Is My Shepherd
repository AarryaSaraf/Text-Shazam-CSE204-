The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want
He makes me to lie down
In green pastures
He leadeth me beside the still waters
Ooh, He restores my soul
He restores my soul
He restores my soul
He restores my soul
Thank you Lord
I wanna thank you
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness
E'en for His name's sake
Yea, tho I walk thru valley of shadow of death
I will fear no evil
For thou art with me
Thy rod and thy staff
And you comfort me
And you comfort me
And you comfort me
And you comfort me
(Thank you Lord)
He prepareth a table before me
In the presence of my enemies
My anoint my head with oil
And my cup overflows
Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me all the days of my life
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Amen
(Wonderful conselour
Prince of peace
Mighty good shepherd
I love you Lord)
