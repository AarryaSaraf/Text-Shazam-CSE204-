I've been waiting such a long time
For a love that's real to come my way
Going to take some getting used to
Now that love is here to stay

After we make love, I'll be lost in the afterglow
You're all I'm dreaming of, I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go
After we make love, there's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow, all that matters is right here and now

Now the world is filled with wonder
You turned my life around in just one day
I love the spell you put me under
With just one kiss you take my breath away

After we make love, feels so good to be lost in the afterglow
You're all I'm dreaming of, I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go
After we make love, there's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow, all that matters is right here and now

All those lonely days and nights
Were well worth going through
I'm so glad I never gave my heart away
It's like I've waited all my life
So I can give it all to you

I've been waiting such a long time
For a love that's real to come my way
It's going to take some getting used to
Now that love is here to stay

After we make love, I'll be lost in the afterglow
You're all I'm dreaming of, I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go
After we make love, there's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow, all that matters is right here and now

All that matters is right here and now
