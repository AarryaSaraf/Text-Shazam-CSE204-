Well there's a bridge and there's a river that I still must cross
As I'm going on my journey
Oh, I might be lost

And there's a road I have to follow, a place I have to go
Well no-one told me just how to get there
But when I get there I'll know
Because I'm taking it

Step by step, bit by bit
Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (oh, yeah)
Step by step, day by day, mile by mile (ooh, ooh, ooh)

And this old road is rough and ruined
So many dangers along the way
So many burdens might fall upon me
So many troubles that I have to face

Oh, but I won't let my spirit fail me
Oh, I won't let my spirit go
Until I get to my destination
I'm going to take it slowly because I'm making it mine

Step by step (you know I'm taking it), bit by bit (bit by bit, come move)
Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (brick by brick by brick by brick mmm...)
Step by step (step by step uh-huh), day by day (day by day-ee)
Mile by mile (ooh), go your own way

Say it, baby, don't give up
You got to hold on to what you got
Oh, baby, don't give up
You got to keep on moving on don't stop (yeah yeah)
I know you're hurting, and I know you're blue
I know you're hurting but don't let the bad things get to you

Step by step (you know I'm taking it), bit by bit (bit by bit, come move)
Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (brick by brick by brick by brick mmm...)
Step by step (step by step uh-huh), day by day (day by day-ee)
Mile by mile (ooh), go your own way

(Come on baby got to keep moving)
(I'm taking it step by step), bit by bit
Stone by stone (yeah, stone by stone), brick by brick
Come on baby
Step by step keep on moving, day by day (day by day-ee)
Mile by mile by mile by mile, go your own way
Come on baby got to keep moving, bit by bit (bit by bit, bit by bit)
