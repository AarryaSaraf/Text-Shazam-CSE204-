Reaching for my dreams
And you're so quick to say what I can't do
You criticize my action
But I don't see you standing in my shoes
I'm going the wrong way
I'm doing the wrong things
Every word just gives me fuel
So come on come on come on come on come on come on

And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on
I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no

For every step I take you're right there
Trying to block my next move
If you're making me feel bad
Then tell me then do you feel good
I'm just human and all I'm doing
That's what my heart tells me I should
So come on come on come on come on come on come on

And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on
I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no

No no no no no no no
It motivates me more and more
And I think it's time you know
Giving me something to work forward
And I can't wait for the day
I can rub things in your face
I ain't going to stop 'til I'm done
I reach the top I'm the No. 1
For every time you try and tell me no
Oh it makes me keep on keeping on

And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on
I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no

And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on
I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no
