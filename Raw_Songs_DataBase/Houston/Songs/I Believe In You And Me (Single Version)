I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be in love eternally
Well, as far as I can see
You will always be the one for me
Oh, yes you will
And I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down, baby
Then I will always be around
Just to be right where you are, my love
You know I love you, boy
I will never leave you out
I will always let you in, boy
Oh, baby, to places no one's ever been
Deep inside can't you see
That I believe in you and me

Maybe I'm a fool to feel the way I do
But I would be the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles
And love is a miracle
And baby, yes, you're a dream come true
I was lost, now I'm free
Oh, baby, 'cause I believe
I do believe
I believe in you and me
See I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

Believe in you and me
