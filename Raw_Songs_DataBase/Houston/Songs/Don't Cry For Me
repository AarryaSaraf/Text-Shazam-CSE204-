Here we are again
That old familiar place
Where the wind will blow
No one ever knows
The time or space

Don't cry for me
Don't shed a tear
The time I've shared with you
Will always be
And when I'm gone
Please carry on
Don't cry for me

No one is to blame
My death was meant to be
Don't carry guilt or shame
The reason why I came
Soon you'll see

Don't cry for me
Don't shed a tear
The time I've shared with you
Will always be
And when I'm gone
Please carry on
Don't cry for me

Don't cry
When life is not the joy
It should be
With life comes pain
Soon time will end its course appointed
Then you will be rewarded
And all this world will see

Don't cry for me
Don't shed a tear
The time I've shared with you
Will always be
And when I'm gone
Please carry on
Don't cry for me
