And forgetting to live the life
Let all the problems get them down
Till they make you wanna shout (Oh yeah)
See, everybody's been down on luck (Yeah)

The sun has chased all the rain away
No more obstacles in our way

I wanna celebrate (Because it's all right)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you, yeah)

Listen
There is oh so many of us that (Underestimate the power of love)
So much hate going 'round and I've had enough
I'm inviting you to fall in love
Though we been going through changes
Just trying to make it from day to day
Tonight don't you worry about a thing
Just cast your cares away

Now, it's time to celebrate (Come on, yeah)
Come on and celebrate (It's what I want)
I wanna celebrate (It's time to celebrate)

I wanna celebrate (Tonight, everyone is a star)
I celebrate you, I celebrate you

I'm gonna give you a reason
Why you should clap your hands and jump for joy
There's something we can believe in
Now that the rain is gone, we're gonna dance on a rainbow
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It's time to celebrate (Come on)
Come on and celebrate (Time to celebrate)
I wanna celebrate (Because it's so right)

// Could I Have This Kiss Forever //

Dame un beso
Para siempre

Over and over, I look in your eyes
You are all I desire
You have captured me
I want to hold you
I want to be close to you
I never want to let go

I wish that this night would never end
I need to know

Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?
Could I have this night to share this night together?
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I hold you for all time?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever, forever?

Over and over, I've dreamed of this night
Now you're here by my side
You are next to me (You are next to me)
I want to hold you (Hold you)
And touch you and taste you (Hold you)
And make you want no one but me

I wish that this kiss could never end, oh no
Oh, baby, please (Please, please)
(Could I?)

Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?
Could I have this night to share this night together?
(Un beso para siempre, para siempre)
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I hold you for all time?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever? (Forever)
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever, forever? (Forever)
And ever? (Forever)
Oh!

I don't want any night to go by
Without you by my side
I just want all my days
Spent being next to you
Lived for just loving you
And, baby, oh, by the way

(Could I hold you?) Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?
Could I have this night to share this night together?
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I just want to hold you?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever, forever (Forever)
And ever? (Forever)

Oh, forever?

Para siempre

Could I have this kiss forever?

// Count On Me //

Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on me

I can see it's hurting you
I can feel your pain
It's hard to see the sunshine through the rain
I know sometimes it seems as if
It's never gonna end
But you'll get through it
Just don't give in because you can

Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on me
You can count on me
Yes you can

I know sometimes it seems as if
We're standing all alone
But we'll get through it
Because love won't let us fall

Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on me

There's a place inside all of us
Where our faith in love begins
You should reach to find the truth in love
The answer's there within, oh
I know that life can make you feel
It's much harder than it really is
But we'll get through it
Just (just) don't (don't) give in

Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on, count on, count on
Count on, count on, count on
Count on me

O, yes you can
No, I can't
Sure you can
No
So glad I can
Count me

// Don't Cry For Me //

Here we are again
That old familiar place
Where the wind will blow
No one ever knows
The time or space

Don't cry for me
Don't shed a tear
The time I've shared with you
Will always be
And when I'm gone
Please carry on
Don't cry for me

No one is to blame
My death was meant to be
Don't carry guilt or shame
The reason why I came
Soon you'll see

Don't cry for me
Don't shed a tear
The time I've shared with you
Will always be
And when I'm gone
Please carry on
Don't cry for me

Don't cry
When life is not the joy
It should be
With life comes pain
Soon time will end its course appointed
Then you will be rewarded
And all this world will see

Don't cry for me
Don't shed a tear
The time I've shared with you
Will always be
And when I'm gone
Please carry on
Don't cry for me

// Exhale (Shoop Shoop) //

Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong
And sometimes it's right
For every win
Someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, Shoop, Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (yeah)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
(All you got to say is shoo be doop)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo be doop)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doo

Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us
The when's or why's
When you've got friends to wish you well
You'll find a point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, Shoop, Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (shoo shoo shoo huh)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop

Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Say shoop say shoo be say shoo be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (say shoo-hoo say sho)
Shoo Be Doo (be doo oh)

Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's
Answers to your prayers
If you're searching for
A place you know
A familiar face
Somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
You're halfway there

Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us
The when's or why's
When you've got friends to wish you well
You'll find a point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, Shoop, Shoop (Shoo Be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo Be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo Be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo-hoo-hoo be)

// Far Enough //

Are we goin' far enough
Far enough
Far enough for love?
Are we goin' deep enough?
Are you real enough?

I got even more to show you
But I got to get to know you

// His Eye Is On The Sparrow //

Why should I feel discouraged
And why should the shadows, shadows come
Lord why, why, why should my heart, my heart feel lonely
And long for heaven, heaven and home, oh-yes
When, when Jesus, Jesus is, he is my portion
A, a constant Friend, constant Friend is He
Oh, oh-oh, his eye is on, his eye is on the sparrow
Oh yes I, I know He watches all over me
Yeah, hey

I sing (I sing)

Is on the sparrow (Sparrow), oh yes he is
I know (Know), I know (And I know)
He watches, thank you Lord, over me

// If You Say My Eyes Are Beautiful //

If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because they're looking at you
And if you could only see yourself
You'd feel the same way too
You could say that I am a dreamer
Who's had a dream come true
If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because they're looking at you

Oh...
If you wonder why I'm smiling
It's because I'm happy with you
And the warm sensations, touch my heart
And fill me through and through
I could hold you close forever
And never let you go
If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because I just love you so

Oh...
Now my heart is an open door
Won't you come inside for more?
You can love so sweetly now
Take my love, take me completely now
Oh...
If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because they're looking at you
And my eyes are just the window, oh
For my feelings to come through
And by far, you are more beautiful
Than anything, I ever know
If you say my eyes are beautiful
If you say my eyes are beautiful
If you say my eyes, my eyes are beautiful
Oh...
It's because
It's because
They're looking at you

(What a beautiful song!)

// Impossible Things //

Impossible

I never listen to nevers
I don't make use for howevers
I can make it through whatever
I got here 'cause I am clever
It's taken me to new levels
Just call me "Hood Cinderella"
Glass slipper fits my new ego

'Cause the world full of pain
Redemption is my name
It's all for those who claim
Who feel we are the same
The world's full of Satan's fools
God takes care of 'em too
For those breakin' all the rules
All the rules

Impossible things
Are happening every day
Impossible things
Are happenin' every day
Impossible things

I split the skies, change the weather
I bring the oceans together
Just watch me fly without feathers
That's how you make perfect better
It's whatever, now or never
Never blink, never think when they tell you "no"
'Cause that'll be the dirt that helps you grow

'Cause the world full of pain
Redemption is my name
It's all for those who claim
Who feel we are the same
The world's full of Satan's fools
God takes care of 'em too
For those breakin' all the rules
All the rules

Impossible things (Impossible things)
Are happening every day (Are happenin' every day)
Impossible things (Impossible things)
Are happenin' every day (Are happenin' every day)
Impossible things (Impossible things)
Are happenin' every day (Are happenin' every day)
Impossible things (Impossible things)
Are happenin' every day (Are happenin' every day)
Impossible things

Uh, outside [?] where a little girl earned her stripes
OG's tellin' me I need to read to write
On the TV, murder rate just goin' through the roof
[?] sendin' me to the store for juice
All the workers at the Kroger know me by my name
Barber shop, nail shop, hair shop, the same
They say, "Leikeli, baby, when you make it big, come back"
That's why I named my first three albums after all of that
Wash & Set, Acrylic, Shape Up, you could check the facts
I just put on for the hood after all of that
Wash & Set, Acrylic, Shape Up, you could check the facts
I just put on for the hood, uh

// Memories //

Forever-er

I know, I cannot leave this place for the memories
Things like the way they knew us all over town

Memories can hang you up and haunt you
All your life, you know
Guess so you cannot stay
And yet cannot go

You are here for-e-ever
We stand together (ever)
Reaching beyond where there is sound
Farther than the eye can see
Forever... (ever, ever, ever, ever)
Forever... (ever, ever, ever, ever)
Forever

I've got to choose between tomorrow and yesterday
I can't stop to think about my life, here today

Memories can hang you up and haunt you
All your life, you know
Guess so you cannot stay
And yet cannot go

You are here for-e-ever
We stand together (ever)
Reaching beyond where there is sound
Farther than the eye can see
Forever... (ever, ever, ever, ever)
Forever... (ever, ever, ever, ever)
Forever

I could find out where you've gone today
I feel so unhappy
Streets seem so empty now
I want you, I want you with me

Maybe I'll find someone to get you
Off my mind
Take me away from here
And leave it, leave it all behind

Nippy you are here we last forever
Reaching beyond
Where there is light

Nippy I sing with you together
In my heart
Ohhhhh

Ohhhhhhh
Memories can hang you up
Memories (memories)... Memories (memories)
Memories
Can hang you up
Ohhhhhhh

(Ever, ever, ever, ever)
Nippy I miss you... Oohhh
(Ever, ever, ever, ever)
Forever

// Moment Of Truth //

Ah, ah, uh, yeah
Baby, ooh, yeah

We've been playing games with our emotions
Let's get what we feel out in the open

Wanting you is all I do
Boy, I know you want me, too
Don't you think it's time we proved
What we've been feeling

This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real, soon enough
Let out your feelings tonight
'Cause oh, I know that I want you
It's all up to me and you
And the moment of truth, yeah yeah yeah

Far too many times a heart gets broken
Just because three words are never spoken

We can't let that bother us
Not when we're so much in love
I could never get enough of saying, I love you

This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real, soon enough
Let out your feelings tonight
'Cause oh, I know that I want you
It's all up to me and you
And the moment of truth

Yeah, yeah, baby, ooh
Wanting you is all I do
Boy, I know you want me, too
Don't you think, it's time we proved
What we've been feeling

This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real, soon enough
Let out your feelings tonight
'Cause oh, I know that I want you
It's all up to me and you
And the moment of truth
This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
(This is our moment of truth)
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real
(Oh, yes it is)
This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
(Our moment, our moment of truth)
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real
This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
(Our moment of truth)
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real

// One Moment In Time //

Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give
The best of me
I'm only one
But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown

I broke my heart
Fought every gain
To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity

I've lived to be
The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity

You're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time

When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity
I will be
I will be
I will be free, yeah
I will be
I will be free

And if you wanna go and take a vacation

It's been one of those crazy weeks (ugh, ugh)
And I gotta do something special for me

Come on, hush ma
You ain't gotta plead your case
I understood you from the jump
You said you needed your space
Take whatever time needed
To give you a peace of mind
'Cause when back rub home
I'm gonna give you a piece of mine
A back rub in the tub
Play in the suds
A simple walk around the park
And let you feed the doves
You my tender "Roni", tell the homies "No Dibs"
'Cause "Every Little Step" you take is "My Prerogative"
Call your girls take an early day off
Go do the manies and the pedies, whatever to stay soft
'Cause today, you the boss
And I'm footing the cost
And whoever else don't like it
They crooked, just stay lost
(One of those, one of those days)

You wanna buy your own Mercedes, get your hands up
If you rolling with Nelly, with me get your hands up

And if you wanna go and take a vacation, hey

Tell lil' Bobby Christina I said what's up alright

// Same Script Different Cast //

Hey Deb
Uh huh
Thank you for being woman enough to come
Whitney, what's this about?
I know he's leaving me for you
Who said that, who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
He told me that he loved me

I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
'Cause I've played that scene before

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
I'm not hating but I wish the one before me
Would have warned me too, babe

Don't say no more la la la la la la la la la
Uncover you're ears girl
I'm not listening la la la la la la la la la
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

It's your fault, you didn't love him enough
That's the problem I loved him too much
And when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you
Oh no, he's changing now he'll prove you wrong
No you won't
So go away, leave us the hell alone 'cause he loves me
He'll hurt you
He'll stay with me
He'll leave you for sure, for sure

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

Lights, camera, now you're on

// The Star Spangled Banner //

Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Over the land of the free and the home of the brave

// Tomorrow //

Jesus said
"Here I stand, won't you please take my hand?"
And you said
"I will tomorrow"
Jesus said
"I am he who supplies all your needs"
And you said
"I know, but tomorrow, ooh, tomorrow, I'll give my life tomorrow
I thought about today, but it's so much easier to say"
Tomorrow, who promised you tomorrow?
You better choose the Lord today
For tomorrow very well might be too late

Jesus said
"Here I stand, won't you please let me in?"
And you said
"I will (I will) tomorrow (Tomorrow)"
Jesus said
"I am he who supplies all your needs (All your needs)"
And you said
"I know, but tomorrow, ooh, ah, tomorrow, I'll give my life tomorrow
I thought about today
But it's so much easier to say"
Tomorrow, who promised you tomorrow?
You better choose the Lord today
For tomorrow very well might be too late

And who said (Who said)
That tomorrow would ever come for you (Would ever come)
Still, you laugh and play and continue on to say

"Tomorrow, I'll give my life tomorrow
I thought about today, but it's so much easier to say"
Tomorrow, who promised you tomorrow?
You better choose the Lord today
For tomorrow very well might be too late
