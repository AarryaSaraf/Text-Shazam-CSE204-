// Celebrate //

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh yeah

Well, everybody's been so uptight
And forgetting to live the life
Let all the problems get them down
Till they make you wanna shout (Oh yeah)
See, everybody's been down on luck (Yeah)
Now finally things are looking up (Oh yeah)
The sun has chased all the rain away
No more obstacles in our way

Now, it's time to celebrate (Come on, yeah)
Come on and celebrate (That's what I want)
I wanna celebrate (Because it's all right)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you, yeah)
I celebrate you

Listen
There is oh so many of us that (Underestimate the power of love)
So much hate going 'round and I've had enough
I'm inviting you to fall in love
Though we been going through changes
Just trying to make it from day to day
Tonight don't you worry about a thing
Just cast your cares away

Now, it's time to celebrate (Come on, yeah)
Come on and celebrate (It's what I want)
I wanna celebrate (It's time to celebrate)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you, yeah)
I celebrate you
It's time to celebrate (Come on, come on)
Come on and celebrate (Don't matter what color you are)
I wanna celebrate (Tonight, everyone is a star)
I celebrate you, I celebrate you

I'm gonna give you a reason
Why you should clap your hands and jump for joy
There's something we can believe in
Now that the rain is gone, we're gonna dance on a rainbow
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It's time to celebrate (Come on)
Come on and celebrate (Time to celebrate)
I wanna celebrate (Because it's so right)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you)
Celebrate me, celebrate me

It's time to celebrate (Time to bring you and me, baby)
Come on and celebrate (Don't matter what color you are)
I wanna celebrate (Tonight everyone is a star)
I celebrate you, you celebrate me
'Cause it's time to celebrate (It's time to celebrate)
Come on and celebrate
I wanna celebrate (Come on, come on)
I celebrate you, you celebrate me
'Cause it's time to celebrate (Celebrate)
Come on and celebrate (Clap your hands)
I wanna celebrate (Clap your hands)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you)
Celebrate me
'Cause it's time to celebrate (Come on, come on, come on)
Come on and celebrate (Come on, come, on)
I wanna celebrate

We love you Whitney!

// Could I Have This Kiss Forever //

Dame un beso
Para siempre

Over and over, I look in your eyes
You are all I desire
You have captured me
I want to hold you
I want to be close to you
I never want to let go

I wish that this night would never end
I need to know

Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?
Could I have this night to share this night together?
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I hold you for all time?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever, forever?
(Forever, ooh)

Over and over, I've dreamed of this night
Now you're here by my side
You are next to me (You are next to me)
I want to hold you (Hold you)
And touch you and taste you (Hold you)
And make you want no one but me

I wish that this kiss could never end, oh no
Oh, baby, please (Please, please)
(Could I?)

Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?
Could I have this night to share this night together?
(Un beso para siempre, para siempre)
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I hold you for all time?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever? (Forever)
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever, forever? (Forever)
And ever? (Forever)
Oh!

I don't want any night to go by
Without you by my side
I just want all my days
Spent being next to you
Lived for just loving you
And, baby, oh, by the way

(Could I hold you?) Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?
Could I have this night to share this night together?
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I just want to hold you?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever, forever (Forever)
And ever? (Forever)

Oh, forever?
(Could I have this kiss forever? Could I have this kiss forever?)
Solo, solo un beso
(Could I have this kiss forever?)
Un beso para siempre (Para siempre)
(Could I have this kiss forever?)
Dame un beso para siempre
(Could I have this kiss forever?)
Para siempre

Could I have this kiss forever?
Could I have this kiss forever?
