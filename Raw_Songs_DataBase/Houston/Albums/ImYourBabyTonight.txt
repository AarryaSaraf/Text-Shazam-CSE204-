Album: ImYourBabyTonight

// I'm Your Baby Tonight //

From the moment I saw you
I went outta my mind
Though I never believed in love at first sight
But you got a magic, boy
That I just can't explain
Well, you got a, you got a way
That you're making me feel
I can do, I can do anything for you, baby
I'll be down for you, baby
Lay all my cards out tonight
Just call on me, baby
I'll be there in a hurry
It's your move, so baby
Baby, decide

Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

From the second you touched me
I was ready to die
I've never been fatal
You're my first time
I feel like an angel
Who just started to fly
Well, you got a, you got a way that you're making me
Feel I can, feel I can, do anything for you, baby
I will fly for you, baby
Hold on and enjoy the ride
I'm not in no hurry
We can fly all night, baby
It's your move, now, baby
Baby, let's fly

Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight
Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

Whatever I do, boy
It's all about you, baby
And ain't it the truth, boy
I'm helplessly in love with you
What else can I do, boy
But be there for you, baby
You got a, you got a way that you're making me
Feel I can, feel
I can do any, do anything

Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight
Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

Looks like I'm fatal
It's all on the table
And baby, you hold the cards
You got the magic
And I've got to have it
I don't want the pieces
I want every single part
I'll be your angel
I'm ready and able
Whatever you want is fine
Whenever you're ready
Just call on your lady
And I'll be your baby tonight, yeah

I'm your baby tonight
I'm your baby tonight

Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight
Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

// My Name Is Not Susan //

One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last
Now Romeo you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't want to hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
(No, no, no, no, no -- get it right)

Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same
Now Romeo you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say good-bye to me boy

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't want to hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't want to hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan

I never want to be the girly that you "call" one and only
You know the kind of girl
That you would call when you get lonely
I never should have let you in
A damn shame
Forgot my name!
Well, anyway

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't want to hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan

Don't want to hear about Susan
My name ain't Susan
Ya better get it right!

// All The Man That I Need //

I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here
It's not the same, it's not the same

He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening
When the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go
He won't let go

He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

// Lover For Life //

I hope that you realize baby, just what you mean to me
Hey you where I run for cover, your loving shelter for me
And when I find myself needing some lifting up
One night with you and that always is enough
Hey you make being in love, a true rare affair
So take me I'm your prisoner

Will you sentence me to be your lover for life
Your lover for life
Will you sentence me, I want to be you lover for life
Your lover for life

I just want to hear you say
You'll be my lover, lover for life
Capture, there's no getaway
You're my lover, my lover for life

Under your spell or under my own power
It really doesn't matter to me
See I fell in love the first time I saw you
And have been falling in love ever since

You heard my testimony, you've seen my evidence
Hey, it's a crime of passion, in every sense
And justice won't be served, 'til you stay here in my world
Take me I'm your prisoner

Will you sentence me to be your lover for life
Your lover for life
Will you sentence me, I want to be you lover for life
Your lover for life

// Anymore //

I believe in roses, but only from the heart
And if it's not sincere, baby then I don't want no part
I believe in one love, baby, true monogamy
What I don't know can't hurt me, well, that's not the way I see
If you believed in me you won't mess around
It's not like I don't know you've been with every girl in town
You got a lot of nerve to think I just close my eyes
While you walk around so full of it I give you my surprise

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no
I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no

I believe that angels watch everything we do
And all the wrong you're doing just might come back on you
I believe in phone calls when you're not by my side
Especially when it's lonely in the middle of the night
If you believe that true love is only made in bed
Lord, have mercy on you, chivalry is dead
You got a lot of nerve to think, to think that I'm still down
While you've taken me for granted, boy, I'm through, I'm outta town

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no
I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no

So baby, you can kiss this girl goodbye
I'm through with you, moving on with my life
No more pain, no more fears
I'm moving on, I'm keeping on, I'm through with all the tears

Your kinda love, your kinda trust
I don't want you
Don't want you, don't need you
Can't have you
Your kinda kisses, to be your Mrs
I don't want you

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no
I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no

I don't need, don't want you
Don't need, don't want
Don't need that kind of love
Don't want your kind of love
I don't need, don't want you
Don't need, don't want
Don't need that kind of love
Don't want your kind of love
Don't need it
Don't want it
Don't need it
Don't want it
Don't need it
Don't need it
Don't want you, don't need you
Don't want you

// Miracle //

How could I throw away a miracle?
How could I face another day?
It's all of my doing, I made a choice
And today, I pay
My heart is full of pain
How could you understand, the way I feel?
How could you relate to so much pain?
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today, I pray
That someone should listen, for

Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store

How could I let go of a miracle?
Nothing cold ever take its place
Thought I was looking, out for myself
Now it seems the pain
Is all that I have gained
I wonder if I could be your miracle
I wonder if I could spare you pain
Seems as though nothing will comfort me
Lord, less today, I pray
That you should come listen

Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store

Don't ever throw away your miracle
Don't let it slip away
Nothing should matter

Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store

// I Belong To You //

In a world where dreams are few
You've got me baby, I've got you
You're the one that makes me feel brand new
Sometimes love can wear you out
Chill your soul, baby, make you doubt
That's you'll never find the one that's true

All my life I've longed for this
Someone who makes me happy
Let's seal this moment with a kiss
I want to know
And nothin's gonna stop me because

I've been to the bottom
But I'm back on top
And I'm feeling the rhythm
As we start to rock
When you get down to it
I belong to you

Though I'm not afraid to let it show
I'll tell the world I want everyone to know
There's nobody who does me like you do, boy

All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothing has ever felt so right
I want it all
And nothin's gonna stop me because

I've been to the bottom
But I'm back on top
And I'm feeling the rhythm
As we start to rock
When you get down to it
I belong to you

When you touch me tender
And you reach my soul
When I start to weaken
And I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you
To you

Say that you love me boy and I'll make it right oh yeah
I'll rock your heart and soul 'til the morning light
Boy no
I will, oh yeah yeah

You know I belong to you
And you belong to me

All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothing has ever felt so right
I want it all
And nothing's gonna stop me because

I've been to the bottom
But I'm back on top
And I'm feeling the rhythm
As we start to rock
When you get down to it
I belong to you

When you touch me tender
And you reach my soul
When I start to weaken
And I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you
To you

I belong to you, baby
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me
When you get down to it
I belong to you
I belong to you, baby
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me, yeah

// Who Do You Love //

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

I got a feeling you're the boy for me
I bet your love can set me free
I feel a love thing coming on
It started week then got oh so strong
Strong enough to rock the world
Straight up I want to be your girl
So I keep praying to the stars above
That it's me who you're going to love

Am I the one?
Is she the one?
I want to know
Could it be me?
Won't you tell me so
Who do you love
You've got to say
Don't want to go
Why can't I stay

I keep pushing so you'll be mine
We'll be loving baby over time
My sensitivity gets so high
It keeps me dreaming that you're my guy
Then I have to stop and check myself
Could it be that you love someone else
I can't give in to jealousy
So touch me now if you love me

Am I the one?
Is she the one?
I want to know
Could it be me?
Won't you tell me so
Who do you love
You've got to say
Don't want to go
Why can't I stay

// We Didn't Know //

We didn't know we didn't know
Since I don't know when
We've been only friends
No more but no less
Our friendship we had at best
A voice to console
An ear to confide
That someone you tell
Your deepest of feelings inside

But we didn't know
When we held each other
It would feel so right
We didn't know
On that night we'd be falling in love
I looked at you
You looked at me
In ways we never thought we would be
But like tomorrow's today's mystery
We didn't know

Be it big, be it small
On you I could call
Nothing but to ask
You'd be right there in a flash

A hand I could hold
That friend I could trust
But the love that we shared
Was just platonic between us

But we didn't know
When we held each other
It would feel so right
We didn't know
On that night we'd be falling in love
I looked at you
You looked at me
In ways we never thought we would be
But like tomorrow's today's mystery
We didn't know

That's what happens
When innocent friends
Turn serious lovers
And we're so happy that
We've fallen in love
And still can be best of friends

When they'd break your heart
And when they'd make you cry
We both would confer
You should give love one more try
We've searched everywhere
For true love to find
Yet who'd think it was us
That we were longing for all the time

Because we didn't know
When we held each other
It would feel so right
We didn't know
On that night we'd be falling in love
I looked at you
And you looked at me
In ways we never thought

We would be
But just like the future
No one can see
We didn't know

But we didn't know
When we held each other
It would feel so right
We didn't know
On that night we'd be falling in love
I looked at you
You looked at me
In ways we never thought we would be
But like tomorrow's today's mystery
We didn't know

// After We Make Love //

I've been waiting such a long time
For a love that's real to come my way
Going to take some getting used to
Now that love is here to stay

After we make love, I'll be lost in the afterglow
You're all I'm dreaming of, I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go
After we make love, there's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow, all that matters is right here and now

Now the world is filled with wonder
You turned my life around in just one day
I love the spell you put me under
With just one kiss you take my breath away

After we make love, feels so good to be lost in the afterglow
You're all I'm dreaming of, I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go
After we make love, there's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow, all that matters is right here and now

All those lonely days and nights
Were well worth going through
I'm so glad I never gave my heart away
It's like I've waited all my life
So I can give it all to you

I've been waiting such a long time
For a love that's real to come my way
It's going to take some getting used to
Now that love is here to stay

After we make love, I'll be lost in the afterglow
You're all I'm dreaming of, I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go
After we make love, there's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow, all that matters is right here and now

All that matters is right here and now

// I'm Knockin' //

Who's to say it's easy
Sometimes life's not fair
I've heard some say just knock the door will open
And when it does you'll find love standing there

And if it's true I'm knocking
Come open up the door
My heart's been right here waiting
For someone to adore
Well if it's true I'm knocking
Come open up the door
My heart's been right here waiting
For someone to adore
Say if it's true
In sight we have to choices
And it's told to me to do or die
And every word he speaks makes me certain
Beyond the door's life's reason why

(Knock the door will open)
The door will open
(Look and you will find it)
Look and you will find it
For certain it's true for me and for you
When love comes and knocks
Here's the right thing to do

(Knock the door will open)
The door will open
(Look and you will find it)
Look and you will find it
For certain it's true for me and for you
When love comes and knocks
Here's the right thing to do

Ask me what I want
Peace of mind
Ask me what I don't
Waste of time
Tell me that it's true
And you will find me knocking

// Takin' A Chance //

There's a chance that maybe in this life I'll find
True love and peace of mind
There's a chance that maybe I can reach my goal
And soar to the other side
Good things come to those who wait
I'm just afraid that I might sit here and wait too late, so

I'm taking a chance on loving you
No matter the price I'll pay my dues
I'm taking a chance on loving you
They tell me I'm crazy

There's a chance that maybe once I could be wrong
But wrong never felt so right
There's a chance that maybe I'm risking much too soon
But our hearts just fell in tune
Good things come to those who wait
I'm just afraid that I might sit here and wait too late, so

I'm taking a chance on loving you
No matter the price I'll pay my dues
I'm taking a chance on loving you
They tell me I'm crazy

I don't know much about you, but I know I can't live without you
I am telling all my friends goodbye
My friends can't understand but
I know I've got to try
Here's my reason why
I'm in love, that's all I know

I'm taking a chance on loving you
No matter the price I'll pay my dues
I'm taking a chance on loving you
They tell me I'm crazy

// Higher Love //

Think about it
There must be higher love
Down in the heart or
Hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart
I'll look inside mine
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We will walk the line
And try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love
I keep thinking of

Worlds are turning
And we're just hanging on
Facing our fear
And standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone
Who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We will walk the line
And try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love
I keep thinking of

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
I could light the night up
With my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine
From pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love
I keep thinking of
