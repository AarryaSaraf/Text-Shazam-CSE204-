// You Give Good Love //

I found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone

Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby, so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby, you give good love

Never stopping
I was always searching for that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of

Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby, so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby, you give good love

Now I, I can't stop looking around
It's not what this love's all about
Our love is here to stay, stay

Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby, so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby, you give good love

// Thinking About You //

I can't get you off my mind
No matter what I do
I'm wishing you were here, with me
It makes no difference
I only think of you
And I'm living out my fantasy

Late at night, I run to you
Being such a love sick fool
It might be pouring rain
But still the same, nothings changed
All and all, I feel no shame
I'm just your fool the same
(I'm just your fool)
(I keep thinking about you baby)
So tell me what you're gonna do
(I keep thinking about you)
All I wanna do is
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind
I'm thinking about you)
That's what I wanna do
(Pick me up, let's go down
I'm thinking about it too)
(I'm thinking about you)
You got me thinking about you
(I'm thinking about it too)

Maybe weeping is a game
That's hard for me to face
(But you need me)
Just like I need you
There's no reason
Just my heart that makes me feel this way
And I hope you feel the same way too

Late at night, I run to you
Being such a love sick fool
It might be pouring rain
But still the same, nothings changed
All and all, I feel no shame
I'm just your fool the same
(I'm just your fool)
(I keep thinking about you baby)
So tell me what you're gonna do
(I keep thinking about you)
All I wanna do is
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind
I'm thinking about you)
That's what I wanna do
(Pick me up, let's go down
I'm thinking about it too)
(I'm thinking about you)
You got me thinking about you
(I'm thinking about it too)

It might be pouring rain
But like a fool, insane
I run to you
I'm just a love sick fool
I've got this thing for you (I'm just a love-sick fool)

Late at night, I run to you
Being such a love sick fool
It might be pouring rain
But still the same, nothings changed
All and all, I feel no shame
I'm just your fool the same
(I'm just your fool)
(I keep thinking about you baby)
So tell me what you're gonna do
(I keep thinking about you)
All I wanna do is
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind
I'm thinking about you)
That's what I wanna do
(Pick me up, let's go down
I'm thinking about it too)
(I'm thinking about you)
You got me thinking about you
(I'm thinking about it too)

// Someone For Me //

(Someone for me)
(Someone for me)
I'm here alone on a Friday night
Waiting here beside the phone
The TV, radio, and me
Really ain't been getting along
I wish that I could find a way
To party to the break of day
And there I'd be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me
Then momma comes and asks me
Why I am dreaming, sitting alone
Why not go out and have some fun
It's the only way I'll ever
Find someone for me
While I am young and seventeen

Someone for me (someone for me)
I've got to find someone
Someone (someone for me)
I've got to find someone

Now there's a party down at Angie's house
With people packed against the walls
I'm sitting in a corner here
Trying to make sense of it all
And when I least expect it
Meeting a guy I see in my dreams
Here he is walking up to me
And asking if I'd like to come and dance with him
I think I found someone for me

Someone for me (someone for me)
I've got to find someone
Someone (someone for me)
I've got to find someone
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me, someone
And so I'm finding out that
Dreams you believe in, can come to be
And now I'm looking up to find that joy
And happiness can come to you and me
I actually found someone for me

Someone for me (someone for me)
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me, someone
(Someone for me)
Someone for me, someone for me
Someone
(Someone for me)
Someone, someone, someone
Someone, someone, someone for me
(Someone for me)
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, yeah, yeah
(Someone for me)
Oh, I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me, someone
(Someone for me)
Someone for me
Someone for me
Someone (someone for me)
Someone, somebody, someone, somebody
Someone, somebody for me
(Someone for me)
Someone, somebody, someone, somebody for me
(Someone for me)

// Saving All My Love For You //

A few stolen moments, is all that we shared
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said, "Be patient, just wait a little longer."
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door

'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm saving all my loving
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
For you, for you

// Nobody Loves Me Like You Do //

Like a candle burning bright
Love is glowing in your eyes
A flame to light our way
That burns brighter everyday
But now I have you
Nobody loves me like you do

Like a leaf upon the wind
I could find no place to land
I dreamed the hours away
And wondered everyday
Do dreams come true?
Nobody loves me like you do

What if I'd never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
You've touched my heart in places that I never even knew
'Cause nobody loves me like you do

I was words without a tune
I was a song still unsung
A poem with no rhyme
A dancer out of time
But now there's you
Baby, nobody loves me like you do

What if I'd never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
You've touched my heart in places that I never even knew
Nobody loves me (nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me (nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me like you do
Nobody loves me like you do

// How Will I Know //

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistakin'
What I feel is really love
Ooh, tell me

How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh, how will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
Hey, how will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
How will I know? (I say a prayer)
How will I know? Ooh
How will I know? (I fall in love)
How will I know?
How will I know?
I'm asking you

// All At Once //

All at once
I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me all at once
All at once
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once

All at once
I looked around and found that you were with another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once
All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once

// Take Good Care Of My Heart //

Time can pass so slowly when you feel so all alone
Love can strike like lightning
When you find your heart a home

I've seen it in the movies
Read about it in a book
I never thought I'd feel it
But your touch was all it took

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it

I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Come and make your magic
'Til you have me hypnotized
If we get any closer
I'll be drowning in your eyes

You're the one I needed most
When my love was on the line
I'm so glad you gave me yours
When I gave you mine

So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it

I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
(Take good care of me...)
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it

I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

(Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart...)
Won't you please...?
Baby, you're the first to take it
And you're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should

// Greatest Love Of All //

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love

// Hold Me //

I'll hold you, and touch you
And make you my woman
And give you my love with sweet surrender
Tonight our hearts will beat as one
And I will hold you, touch you
And make you my woman tonight

There's something in your eyes I see
A pure and simple honesty

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

I believe you when you say that you love me
Know that I won't take you for granted
Tonight the magic has begun
So won't you hold me, touch me
Make me your woman tonight

There's something in your eyes I see
I won't betray your trust in me

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

I'll hold you (Hold you)
And touch you (Touch you)
And make you my woman (Make me your woman)
Tonight (Tonight)

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together
Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together
