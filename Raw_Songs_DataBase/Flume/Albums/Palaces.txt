// Highest Building //

Baby, baby, I've been where you told me
All the way up to the highest building
I didn't look down on the way in
All the way up to the highest building
Everything you said, I believed it
Dedicated to the maze, the illusion
The only one path, one decision
Was the way up to the highest building

All the way up to the highest building

Thousand stories to climb on my own
But all I've found was a thousand more
Waiting there in an ocean of clouds
When there's nowhere to go, find the way to the ground

Baby, baby, I've been where you told me
All the way up to the highest building
I didn't look down on the way in
All the way up to the highest building
Every single step, I could hear you
Dedicated to the maze, I could feel you
The only one path, one decision
Was the detonate the highest building

All the way up to the highest building

Never thought that I would realise it
You could never really fight it
And every little piece of me that lies in you will never disappear

Never thought that I would realise it
You could never really fight it
And every little piece of me that lies in you will never disappear

// Say Nothing //

As far as summer goes I'm not even close
To wearing you like clothes when nobody's home
Now I don't see your ghost everywhere I go
And as far as I know you need me the most

Now I'm not on the inside anymore
You talk, but at the same time say nothing
Now all I see is daylight when you're gone
If you don't wanna say goodbye, say goodbye

Say nothing, say nothing
No running back, running back
Say nothing, say nothing
If you don't wanna say goodbye

Say nothing, say nothing
It isn't so bad, you should know that
Say nothing, say nothing
No running back, running back

You're lying through your teeth when I turn my head (Turn my head, turn my head)
As far as subtleties, well it's not my best (Not my best)
It hurts to love and leave, I don't love you less
I saw it on your sleeves, you made such a mess

Now I'm not on the inside anymore
You talk, but at the same time say nothing
Now all I see is daylight when you're gone
If you don't wanna say goodbye, say goodbye

Say nothing, say nothing
No, run it back, run it back
Say nothing, say nothing
If you don't wanna say goodbye

Say nothing, say nothing
It isn't so bad, you should know that
Say nothing, say nothing
No, run it back, run it back

It's not harder than you think
It's not like we ever burned so bright
I don't wanna hear a thing
So if you don't wanna say goodbye

Say nothing, say nothing (Say nothing)
No, run it back, run it back
Say nothing, say nothing
If you don't wanna say goodbye (Say goodbye, goodbye)

Say nothing, say nothing
It isn't so bad, you should know that
Say nothing, say nothing
No, run it back, run it back

Say nothing (Say nothing, run it back)
Say goodbye (Say goodbye)
Say nothing
Nothing
Nothing

// ESCAPE //

Ex-thoughts to translate
Memories you wanna shape
Distort, watch them mutate
Make it easy to erase, to erase

Find another way, you could be here too
Help me elevate, I just wanted to escape
Find another way, what you left to lose?
Ex-communicate, I just wanted to escape

Old roads to re-trace, new ideas to embrace
Take hold, watch it translate
Make it easy to relate, to relate

Find another way, you could be here too
Help me elevate, I just wanted to escape
Find another way, what you left to lose?
Ex-communicate, I just wanted to escape

// I Can't Tell //

Pick myself up off the ground
Tired of hearing the sound
Of the hands of the clock go round
Misery come down
Think they have been here for days
Scared but I'm not afraid
I'm just parting, trying to find an escape
Picking the lock on the cage

Where've you been?
Where did you go, go?
How can you sleep knowing you don't know?
If I'm okay, I hope I'm not
If you care, I can't tell
You put up walls knowing I can't see
How can you die knowing I can't breathe?
Am I okay? I hope I'm not
If you care, I can't tell

Do you know how it felt?
A question that I answer myself
I'm standing here in amazement
You really showed me yourself
Making it hard to engage (Mm, mm)
There's nothing left to say (Mm, mm)
Instances that you can't erase
Wasting away
Wide awake

Where've you been?
Where did you go, go?
How can you sleep knowing you don't know?
If I'm okay, I hope I'm not
If you care, I can't tell (Woah)
You put up walls knowing I can't see
How can you die knowing I can't breathe?
Am I okay? I hope I'm not
If you care, I can't tell

// Hollow //

Now I got you on my side
We could start an empire
You, me and the skyline
Riding on a beam light
Lift me till I'm up high
Time fly and I glide by
Real life highlight
Now we're dancing on a fine line

And you make me wanna look twice
To see divine in my life
Yeah, there's crystals on the front line
And I trust you with my whole life
And you make me wanna look twice
To see what's on the inside
There's a halo under your eyes

Wherever you may go
Part of me follows
Bound by no ropes and ties
I got you for one night
Wherever you may go
Part of me follows
Bound by no ropes and ties
I got you for one night

But when I am hollow
And I miss you and I feel like
I've got no level
And I miss you and I feel like

Look twice, look twice, look twice, look twice

Now my light is amplified
See, I got you on the good side
Love be my guide
Flying through the divide
And you make me wanna look twice
To see divine in my life
Yeah, there's crystals on the front line
And I trust you with my whole life
And you make me wanna look twice
To see what's on the inside
There's a halo under your eyes

Wherever you may go
Part of me follows
Bound by no ropes and ties
I got you for one night
Wherever you may go
Part of me follows
Bound by no ropes and ties
I got you for one night

But when I am hollow
And I miss you and I feel like
I got no level
And I miss you and I feel like

I've got some feelings of fire
I've got some sense of desire
Feelin' a light just in light of
The fact that we are alive
And I'm on my way
Changing up lanes
Fly through the gates
Money's on me
I see you're real
I see your fear
I see you clear

When I am hollow
And I miss you and I feel like
I've got no level
And I miss you and I feel like

Look twice, look twice, look twice, look twice
Look twice, look twice, look twice, look twice

// Sirens //

And if I could
I'd raise my arm
And wave a wand
To end all harm

And if I could
With just a sigh
I'd stop the tide
Of siren cries

And if I could
With just a sigh
I'd stop the tide
Of siren cries

And if I could
And if I could
No wand of mine
No end in sight

And if I could
I'd raise my arm
And wave a wand
To end all harm

And if I could
With just a sigh
I'd stop the tide
Of siren cries

And if I could
Dissolve all pride
Unite divides
Surrender sides

And if I could
And if I could
No wand of mine
No end in sight

And if I could

// Go //

I'm taking off

No wasting time, if you love me, you'll answer
No wasting time, if you love me, you'll answer
No wasting time, if you love me, you'll answer
I'm taking off

No wasting time, you'll answer
No wasting time, if you love me, you'll answer
No wasting time, you'll answer
No wasting time, if you love me, you'll answer
I'm taking off

// Palaces //

I thought beyond the exit there would be palaces
And so there were, composed within time, being here before
If outside is no more, the golden astroturf
The countdown to the big show, swimming in casinos
