You wanna let me know now that you've let me go
Life is better still and I guess somehow
You'll just keep on coming back
I wanna let you know now that you've let me go
Life is better still and I guess somehow
Everyone says you're coming back

But I'll let you know that you fill me whole
So now you try to call me home
Let me know what you're thinking of
And now these words are all air

You wanna let me know now that you've let me go
Life is better still and I guess somehow
You'll just keep on coming back

But I'll let you know that you fill me whole
So now you try to call me home
Let me know just what you're thinking of
And now these words are all air
Boy let me know what you're thinking of
So now that you try to call me home
Let me know just what you're thinking of
And now these words are all air

You won't see what everyone can
Did I make you feel like less of a man?
I heard you drive past my house again
Over again, over again
But I'll let you know that you fill me whole
So now you try to call me home
Let me know just what you're thinking of
And now these words are all air

But I'll let you know that you fill me whole
So now you try to call me home
Let me know just what you're thinking of
And now these words are all air
And now these words are all air
