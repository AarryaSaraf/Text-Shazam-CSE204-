You won't go fooling me twice now, baby
I'm sorry that's the way you're made
I let you get to me once now, baby
But I'll never let you win again

Cover it up, you like to play your own game
Cover it up, you let them know what you're thinking
I bet you never tell them how it feels
I bet you never even try to be real
