Sky, sky, sky
Is it only here for some?
Do it and they overcome
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Shining bright, mm

So what, so what, so why?
It's never what they say it's gon' be
Sky, sky, sky
Would you ever take it from me?

Sky, sky, sky
I'm over what I'm living on
Only thing I'll ever want
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Shining bright at me
Shining bright past me

So what, so what, so what?
It's never what they say it's gon' be
Sky, sky, sky
Would you ever take it from me?
Oh

From me, from me, from me, oh
From me, from me, from me, mm
Oh, mm, mm, mm
