Ex-thoughts to translate
Memories you wanna shape
Distort, watch them mutate
Make it easy to erase, to erase

Find another way, you could be here too
Help me elevate, I just wanted to escape
Find another way, what you left to lose?
Ex-communicate, I just wanted to escape

Old roads to re-trace, new ideas to embrace
Take hold, watch it translate
Make it easy to relate, to relate

Find another way, you could be here too
Help me elevate, I just wanted to escape
Find another way, what you left to lose?
Ex-communicate, I just wanted to escape
