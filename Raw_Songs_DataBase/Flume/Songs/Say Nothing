As far as summer goes I'm not even close
To wearing you like clothes when nobody's home
Now I don't see your ghost everywhere I go
And as far as I know you need me the most

Now I'm not on the inside anymore
You talk, but at the same time say nothing
Now all I see is daylight when you're gone
If you don't wanna say goodbye, say goodbye

Say nothing, say nothing
No running back, running back
Say nothing, say nothing
If you don't wanna say goodbye

Say nothing, say nothing
It isn't so bad, you should know that
Say nothing, say nothing
No running back, running back

You're lying through your teeth when I turn my head (Turn my head, turn my head)
As far as subtleties, well it's not my best (Not my best)
It hurts to love and leave, I don't love you less
I saw it on your sleeves, you made such a mess

Now I'm not on the inside anymore
You talk, but at the same time say nothing
Now all I see is daylight when you're gone
If you don't wanna say goodbye, say goodbye

Say nothing, say nothing
No, run it back, run it back
Say nothing, say nothing
If you don't wanna say goodbye

Say nothing, say nothing
It isn't so bad, you should know that
Say nothing, say nothing
No, run it back, run it back

It's not harder than you think
It's not like we ever burned so bright
I don't wanna hear a thing
So if you don't wanna say goodbye

Say nothing, say nothing (Say nothing)
No, run it back, run it back
Say nothing, say nothing
If you don't wanna say goodbye (Say goodbye, goodbye)

Say nothing, say nothing
It isn't so bad, you should know that
Say nothing, say nothing
No, run it back, run it back

Say nothing (Say nothing, run it back)
Say goodbye (Say goodbye)
Say nothing
Nothing
Nothing
