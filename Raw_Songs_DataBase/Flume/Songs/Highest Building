Baby, baby, I've been where you told me
All the way up to the highest building
I didn't look down on the way in
All the way up to the highest building
Everything you said, I believed it
Dedicated to the maze, the illusion
The only one path, one decision
Was the way up to the highest building

All the way up to the highest building

Thousand stories to climb on my own
But all I've found was a thousand more
Waiting there in an ocean of clouds
When there's nowhere to go, find the way to the ground

Baby, baby, I've been where you told me
All the way up to the highest building
I didn't look down on the way in
All the way up to the highest building
Every single step, I could hear you
Dedicated to the maze, I could feel you
The only one path, one decision
Was the detonate the highest building

All the way up to the highest building

Never thought that I would realise it
You could never really fight it
And every little piece of me that lies in you will never disappear

Never thought that I would realise it
You could never really fight it
And every little piece of me that lies in you will never disappear
