Put away your inhibitions
Let the beast in you just get loose
We all young, wild and different
We could all get lit from a lil goose
I know you're terrified by what the future lies
But there's no compromising, it's my way or the highway
We all just played the lust, hard building breaking trust
She gon' get wowed when we come out
Like she gon' get loud when the weed come out this instant
Give a fuck what your friends think
Tell their boosie ass go wait in line
With them lame niggas talking real rap
Tell 'em break your neck go and bust a rhyme

Blow one down, pass it around, aye
Fuck with me now, we're running wild, aye
Nobody game, we own the town, aye
Never come down, I'll never come down

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

Everybody got guilty pleasures
Mine just turned to catch me cases
Handcuffs, police inspections
Lawyers, judges, allegations
Turn on your favorite station
You hear the same old song
I feel like Nagasaki, dog
I'm 'bout to drop the bomb

Blow one down, pass it around, aye
Fuck with me now, we're running wild, aye
Nobody game, we own the town, aye
Never come down, I'll never come down

Blow one down, pass it around, aye
Fuck with me now, we're running wild, aye
Nobody game, we own the town, aye
Never come down, I'll never come down

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it
