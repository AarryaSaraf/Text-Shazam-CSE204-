And if I could
I'd raise my arm
And wave a wand
To end all harm

And if I could
With just a sigh
I'd stop the tide
Of siren cries

And if I could
With just a sigh
I'd stop the tide
Of siren cries

And if I could
And if I could
No wand of mine
No end in sight

And if I could
I'd raise my arm
And wave a wand
To end all harm

And if I could
With just a sigh
I'd stop the tide
Of siren cries

And if I could
Dissolve all pride
Unite divides
Surrender sides

And if I could
And if I could
No wand of mine
No end in sight

And if I could
