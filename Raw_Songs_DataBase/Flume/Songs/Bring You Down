Hush now
You're standing on a landmine
Tread lightly
Get ready to explode

Hush now
Those eyes can not harm you
Keep your wits about
Don't let it bring you down

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise
This awful truth

I've seen it all before
Your eyes are wet
Your head is on the floor
And it's only a matter of time
Before you hit the ground running
Running running
Running running

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise
This awful truth

Hush now
You're standing on a landmine
Tread lightly
Get ready to explode

Hush now
Your eyes can not harm you
Keep your wits about
Don't let it bring you down

And never let go
And I'm afraid of being too wrong
And I'm afraid of being too wrong in this side, oh

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise
This awful truth
