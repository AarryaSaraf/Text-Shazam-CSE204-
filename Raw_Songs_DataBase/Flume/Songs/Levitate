I'm blowin' kisses couple states away
She blow me back and then I elevate
We go a hunnit like a speed race
You know your heart I'd never break
I thought I made that clear don't wanna have you livin' in fear you know I'm in it for the ride
Baby I'm in it for the ride, ride' ride' oh yeah

Ignited the fire it's climbin' we're high now
Excited we dive in she's frightened of flying (Flying)
We ain't planning on coming down

Strap up the only time we play it safe
Used to daydream of takin' you to second base
If they do you wrong I'd set aflame the whole place
I mean the whole place' oh yeah
I thought I made that clear
Imma make all ya worries disappear
Baby I'm in it for the ride
I said I'm in it for the ride, ride, ride' oh yeah

Ignited the fire it's climbin' we're high now
Excited we dive in she's frightened of flying (Flying)
We ain't planning on coming down

We ain't planning on coming down
We gon' levitate now
We gon' levitate now
We ain't planning on coming down
We gon' levitate now
