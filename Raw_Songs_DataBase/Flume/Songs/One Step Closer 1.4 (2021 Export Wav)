If I could take only one step closer
To you
If I could take only one step closer
To you

It's one step closer
It's right there in the center of the screen
Soft touch on the back of the neck
Up in smoke, you can see it so clear now
Out mind when the smoke disappears

If I could take only one step closer
It's one step closer to you
If I could take only one step closer
To you

One step closer

And when it moves the shutter inside you
So close like a shadow of skin
Rubbed up against it, a sound in the distance
Made it banish with the press of a switch

If I could take only one step closer
It's one step closer to you
If I could take only one step closer
To you

It's one step closer to you
It's one step closer
