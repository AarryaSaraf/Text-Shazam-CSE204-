Cocaine heart is broken, time to retire
Head won't listen to the words I decide on
Meet this, this is from a point of arrival
Preach it from another human devour

Cocaine heart is broken, time to retire
I don't know purple, though tropical
Head won't listen to the words I decide on
I'm a ghost open for bidding poll
Meet this, this is from a point of arrival
Pardon, but knock the show overload
Preach it from another human devour

I don't know purple, though tropical
I'm a ghost open for bidding poll
Pardon, but knock the show overload
Easy, done - something for everyone

Meet this, this is from a point of arrival
Pardon, but knock the show overload
Preach it from another human devour
Easy, done - something for everyone

Cocaine heart is broken, time to retire
I don't know purple, though tropical
Head won't listen to the words I decide on
I'm a ghost open for bidding poll
Meet this, this is from a point of arrival
Pardon, but knock the show overload
Preach it from another human devour

Cocaine heart is broken, it's time to retire
Head spun overlooking, I don't want no fire
