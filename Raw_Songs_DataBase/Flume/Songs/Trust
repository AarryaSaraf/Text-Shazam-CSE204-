I can't fight, holding much, you know I trust in reason
That I would go back
And I'm over you
And I better make it
And not go back

And I'd kill to
Kick my beat back into you
Hear me out, babe, I wanna talk about it
Kick my beat back into you

And I'd kill to
See my lips out next to you
Hear me out, babe, I wanna talk about it
Kick my beat back into you

And I'd kill to
Kick my beat back into you
Hear me out, Babe, I wanna talk about it
Kick my beat back into you

I, I wanted to
High, High, But I'm going slow
I, I wanted to
Hearts, Hearts, But I'm going slow

(Maybe it's something I should have said a long time ago)
