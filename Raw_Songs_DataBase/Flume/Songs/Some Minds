In our home all day I waited for the change
Something warm that I could say
But I admit it won't come
Somehow I don't care
Though I love the clothes she wears
And I love her body bare (bare)

So, I pray, I pray that it won't feel the same, and
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Darling yeah, we both knew it from the start
Some minds are better kept apart

Here I pass the day in a most peculiar way
Watching ships out in the bay
And I swallow so hard
Am I too weak to fight?
As the day becomes the night
And I don't want to be right (right)

So, I pray, I pray that it won't feel the same, and
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Darling yeah, we both knew it from the start
Some minds are better kept apart

I pray that it won't feel the same, and
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Darling yeah, we both knew it from the start
Some minds are better kept apart
