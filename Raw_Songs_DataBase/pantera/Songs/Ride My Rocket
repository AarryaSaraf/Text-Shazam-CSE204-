In this day and time of metal magic
We need rock and roll
We need PANTERA

I didn't wanna touch you
Since we were both sixteen
Didn't wanna take you down
And show you what love means
Now is the time
This is the place
Get ready to take a chance
We don't have a minute to waste

Ride my rocket
Wear me out
Ride my rocket
Make me twist and shout
Ride my rocket
Give me all of your love
Ride my rocket
I just can't get enough

You leave me breathless
When you walk by
The way you move it girl
Makes you satisfy
You might be the best
That I've ever had
It's gotta be good girl
Cuz it looks so bad

Ride my rocket
Wear me out
Ride my rocket
Make me twist and shout
Ride my rocket
Give me all of your love
Ride my rocket
I just can't get enough

Feels so good
Makes my heart break
Every time you touch me
I explode into flames

Ride my rocket
Wear me out
Ride my rocket
Make me twist and shout
Ride my rocket
Give me all of your love
Ride my rocket
I just can't get enough
