How many roads must a man walk down
Before he's called a man
Tell me, how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Tell me, how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
No, the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer: blowin' in the wind

How many times must a man look above
Before he sees the sky
Tell me, how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
What I wanna know is
How many deaths will it take 'til he knows
Too many people have died
Oh, the 
No, the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer: somewhere in the the wind

How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed out to the sea
Tell me, how many years can people exist
Before they are allowed to be free
How many times can a man turn his head
Pretending that he just doesn't see
Oh, the answer, my friend, blowin' in whe wind
The answer: blowin' in the wind

Blowin' in the wind, blowin' in the wind
The answer: somewhere in the wind
That answer is somewhere in the wind
