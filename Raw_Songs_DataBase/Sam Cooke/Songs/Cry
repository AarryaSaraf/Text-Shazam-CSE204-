If your sweetheart, sends a letter, of goodbye
It's no secret, you'll feel better, if you cry
When waking from a bad dream,
don't you sometimes think it's real
Well it's only false emotions,
that you feel

If your heartaches seems to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting blue-er with each song
Remember, sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go on and cry

remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
so let your hair down and go on and cry
so let your hair down and go on and cry.
