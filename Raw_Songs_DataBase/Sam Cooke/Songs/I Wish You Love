I wish you bluebirds in the spring
to give your heart a son to sing.
And then a kiss oh but more than this,
I wish you love.

And in July a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade.
I wish you health oh and more than wealth. I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree that you and I will never be.
So with my best my very best I am ' setn' you free
Oh honey.

I wish you shelter from the storm.
A cozy fire to keep you worm.
Oh but most of all I wish you love.
But most of all when snowflakes fall I wish you love.
But most of all when snowflakes fall I wish you love.
