If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
hammer in the evening
all over this land

I'd hammer out danger
hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out love between
my brothers and my sisters
all over this land

If I had a bell
I'd tinkle in the morning
tinkle in the evening time
all over this land
I'd tinkle out that danger
I'd tinkle out a warning
tinkle out love between
my brothers and my sisters
all over this land

If I had a song
sing it in the evening
all over this land
and I'd sing out danger
sing out a warning
I'd sing out love between
my brothers and my sisters
all over this land

yeah, oh yeah
yeah, oh yeah
yeah, yeah

If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
a hammer in the evening time
all over this land

I hammer out danger
hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out love between
my brothers and my sisters
all over this land

look, I got a hammer
and I got a bell
and I got a song to sing
all over this land
it's the hammer of justice
a bell of freedom yeah
it's a song about love
between my brothers and my sisters
