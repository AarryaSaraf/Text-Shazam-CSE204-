If you love somebody the way that I do
And your heart is hoping she feels that way too
You're longing to ask her, you're longing to know, oh
But what do you say if her answer is no?

There's so much to tell her, so much to say
But how can I tell her, when I'm so afraid
That she might not love me, and if this is so, oh
What do I say if her answer is no?

What do you say when your dreams disappear
And all that you've planned fades from view?
And oh, what do you say when your eyes fill with tears
And your heart is breaking in two, woah oh

Tonight I will tell her the way that I feel
I think that she knows, for it's hard to conceal
If she says she loves me, my whole world will glow, oh
But what will I say if her answer is no?
