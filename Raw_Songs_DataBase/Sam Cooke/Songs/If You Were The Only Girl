I would say such wonderful things to you
And there would be such wonderful things to do

If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy, I were the only boy

Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way

A garden of Eden, just made for two
With nothing to mar, nothing to mar our joy

And I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do

If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

Hmm, hmm mm
Hmm hmm mmm mm
Hmm hmm mmm mm
