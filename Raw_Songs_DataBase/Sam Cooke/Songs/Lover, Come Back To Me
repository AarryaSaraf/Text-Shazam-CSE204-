The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new, and so was love
The eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, lover where can you be

You came at last, love had his day
That day is past, you gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, lover come back to me

When I remember every thing you used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder, no wonder, I am lonely

The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new, but love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, lover come back to me
Lover, lover come back to me
Lover, lover come back to me
