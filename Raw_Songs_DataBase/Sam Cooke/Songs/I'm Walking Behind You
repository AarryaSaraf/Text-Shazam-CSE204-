I'm walking behind you
and I'll hear your promise
to love and obey
tough you may forget me
you're still on my mind

Look over your shoulder
I'm walking behind
Maybe I'll kiss again
with a love that's new
But I shall wish again
I was kissing you
'Cause I'll always love you
wherever you go
And tough we are parted
I wan't you to know
That if things go wrong dear
and faith is unkind
Look over your shoulder
I'm walking behind
