I want to cross over into campground

Deep river
My home is over Jordan
Deep river, Lord
I want to cross over into campground
I want to cross over into campground

Oh, don't you want to go
To that gospel feast
That promised land where all is peace

Deep River, Lord
I want to cross over into campground
I want to cross over into campground
Into campground
