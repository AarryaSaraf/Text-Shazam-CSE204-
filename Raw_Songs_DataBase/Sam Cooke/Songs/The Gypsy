In a quaint caravan there's a lady they call the gypsy
She can look in the future and drive away all your fears
Everyone of your fears
Everything will come right if you'll only believe the gypsy
She could tell at a glance that my heart was so full of tears

She looked in my hand and told me my love was always true
But yet in my hearts I knew dear somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again cause I want to believe the gypsy
That my lover is true and will come back to me someday

She looked in my hand and told me my love was always true
But yet in my hearts I knew dear somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again cause I want to believe the gypsy
That my lover is true and will come back to me someday
