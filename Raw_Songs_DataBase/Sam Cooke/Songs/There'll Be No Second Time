You done me wrong
I tried to be kind baby
'Cause you told me you were mine o mine
But you walked out and left me behind
So there'll be no second time

I was a fool to give my love
Cause you swore you'd love me
By the stars above
But you walked out and left me behind
So there'll be no, no second time

Go on and laugh and have your fun
Let the good times keep rollin' on
There'll come a day
When you have to pay
For everything that you done wrong, baby

You can cry, you can rave
Try to show you love me
In a, a million ways
But you walked out and left me behind
So there'll be no, no second time

Go on and laugh and have your fun
Let the good times keep rollin' on
There'll come a day
When you have to pay
For everything that you done wrong
Listen to me

You can cry, you can rave
Try to show you love me
In a, a million ways
But you walked out left me behind
So there'll be no, no second time

No doubt certainly there'll be no second time
