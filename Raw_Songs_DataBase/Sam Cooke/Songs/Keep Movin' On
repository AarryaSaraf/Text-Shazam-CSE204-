Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Every day

Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way, yeah
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Every day

When I go to sleep at night
I add up my day
Tryin' to recall the things I've done
And debts I have to pay
For there is one thing that I know:
What you reap is what you sow

Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way, so
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Every day

Brother, mind out what you do
And how you treat your fellow man
If you knew like me you'd try and live
The very best you can
For if you spread good all around
You'll be able to sleep when the sun go down

Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way, so
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Every day
