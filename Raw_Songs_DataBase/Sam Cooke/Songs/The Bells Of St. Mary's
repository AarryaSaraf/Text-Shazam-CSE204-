The bells of St. Mary's
I hear they are calling
the young loves, the true loves
who come from the sea

And so my beloved
when red leaves are falling
the love bells are shell
ring out, ring out
for you and me

the bells of st mary's
I hear they are calling
the young loves, the true loves
who come from the sea

And so my beloved
when red leeves are falling
the love bells shell
ring out, ring out
for you and me
