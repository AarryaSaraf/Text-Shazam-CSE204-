Oh how I love you
every moment I can see your face
Oh how I love you
no one, no one could ever
never will take your place

oh how I love you
every moment I know I see your face
oh how I love you
no one could ever take your place

every morning when I rise
I can almost see you standing before my eyes
and every night when I go to sleep
my prayer is our love will keep
I long to see your smiling face
I long to feel your warm embrace
how could anyone ever take your place

oh how I love you
every moment I know I see your
oh how I love you
no one could ever take your place
oh how I love you
