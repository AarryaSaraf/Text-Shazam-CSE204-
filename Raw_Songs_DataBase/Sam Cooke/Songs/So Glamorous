So glamorous
My darling, you are so glamorous
You're so exciting, so adorable
And I'm so in love with you, with you

And woah oh oh, you're so wonderful
To me, you are so wonderful
You're so exciting, so alluring
And I'm so in love with you

In school, I sit behind you
You never notice me
If you'd only turn and smile
How happy I would be
But when I'm face to face with you
I'm completely lost
Is it that I haven't the nerve
Or is it because

You're so beautiful
To me, you are so beautiful
You're so exciting, you're so wonderful
And I'm so in love with you

In school, I sit behind you
You never notice me
If you'd only turn and smile
How happy I would be
But when I'm face to face with you
I'm completely lost
Is it that I haven't the nerve
Or is it because

You're so beautiful
To me, you are so beautiful
You're so exciting, you're so wonderful
And I'm so in love with you
