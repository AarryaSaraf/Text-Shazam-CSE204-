this wonderful world we live in
is God's masterpiece of art
and I live each golden moment
with his love in my heart

I thank God
for blessing me
with eyes to see
each wondrous day
and I thank God
for hands to help
my fellow man along the way

he gave me lips to speak the simple truth
and ears to hear to magic dreams of youth
I thank God for giving me
his blessed book with words divine
for now I know dear God I know
the miracle of life is mine

yes Dear God I know
the miracle of life is mine
