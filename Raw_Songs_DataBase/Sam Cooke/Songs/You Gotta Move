You gotta move, you gotta move
Baby, you gotta move
If you keep on mistreatin' me, baby
You gotta move
If you keep on doggin' me, baby
You gotta move

My mother told me long time ago
Watch out for women, oh, they hurt you so
And if you keep on hurting me like you're doing
You gotta move

I said you gotta move
You gotta move
Move on, you gotta move

Let me tell you, baby, I love you, baby, to my heart
You keep on mistreatin' me baby, oh, we got to part
I hate to let you go, baby
But oh, you gotta move

Let me tell you one more time, you gotta move
Gotta move, get away from me
Baby, oh, you gotta move
Now if you keep on hurting my heart gal
You gotta move

One more time, move one
You gotta move from me baby
You gotta move, I hate to let you go, baby
But oh, you gotta move
