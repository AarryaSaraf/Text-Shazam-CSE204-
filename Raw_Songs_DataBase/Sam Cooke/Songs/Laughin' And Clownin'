Laughin' and clownin'
Just to keep from cryin'
I'm laughin' and clownin'
Just to keep from cryin'

I keep on tryin' to hide the fact
I've got a worried mind

Let me tell you, being life of the party
Seemed to be my role
Since you left me, baby, being life of the party
Seemed to be my role

I keep on tryin' to hide my feelings
Trying to hide my soul

Let me tell you what I do, I stand in the doorway
Watchin' all the girls go through
You might not believe me, baby, but I stand in the doorway
Watchin' all the girls go through

I keep on tryin' to me find someone
To take my mind off you, tickle 'em for me

I keep on laughin' and clownin'
To take my mind off you
