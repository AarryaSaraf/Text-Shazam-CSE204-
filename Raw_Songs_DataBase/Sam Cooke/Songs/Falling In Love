I'm falling in love
With someone
Who's not falling in love with me
How can I escape this future
That holds nothin' but misery?

I'm giving my all
To someone
Who's not giving her all to me
If she only knew what she's doin' to me
She would set my poor heart free

I know there's been many before me
Who've had a one-sided love
But goodness knows
A poor boy like me
Needs some help from above

So Lord I'm falling in love
With someone
Who's not falling in love with me
If she only cared just the very least bit
I'd be happy as a boy could be
Lord, I'd be happy as a boy could be
