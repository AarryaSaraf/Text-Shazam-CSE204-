You're here, that moment's near,
I'm almost in your arms
Tonight, the mood is right,
I'm almost in your arms

One sigh, one word
and I will rush to your embrace
Say that certain word,
sigh that certain sigh
And with all my heart,
to your arms I'll fly
It's strange, how we are changed
by things that seem so small
One look can write a book,
one touch can say it all

We know those nights alone,
and now we found our way
I'm almost in your arms,
nearly in your arms to stay
