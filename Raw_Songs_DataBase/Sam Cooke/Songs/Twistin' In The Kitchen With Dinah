it seemed to me that I heard music
coming through the kitchen door
So I peeped in, saw my Dinah with a fellow
that I've never seen before

and he was twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
twistin in the kitchen, I know
twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
to the music of an old banjo

and singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,

And going around and around and around and around
around and around and around and around

And going around and around and around and around
around and around and around and around

Should have been my with My Dinah
Should have been me, I know
Should have been me, twistin in the kitchen
to the music of an old banjo

I saw him twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
twistin in the kitchen, I know
he was twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
to the music of an old banjo

and singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,

And going around and around and around
around and around and around and around

And going around and around and around and around
around and around and around and around
