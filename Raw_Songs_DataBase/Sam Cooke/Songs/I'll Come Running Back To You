Folks say that you've found someone new
To do the things I used to do for you
Just call my name, I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you

Can't sleep at night, I can't eat a bite
When you were mine I didn't treat you right
Just call my name, I'm not ashamed
I'l come running back to you

Just like a king, I've lost everything
I sit all alone on my throne
I've got my pride, but deep down inside
I'm yours and yours alone

I try to forget, have no regrets
This love of ours could always start anew
Just call my name, I know I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you

Just like a king I've lost everything
I sit all alone on my throne
I've got my pride, but deep down inside
I'm yours and yours alone

I try to forget, have no regrets
This love of ours could always start anew
Just call my name
I know, I know, I know I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you.
