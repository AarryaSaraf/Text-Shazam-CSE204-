Up and down and through the town
The Piper plays today
Doors and windows open wide
To greet him on his way

He's dressed all up in little boots
And green and yellow clothes
And when he plays his little harp
Away your trouble goes

Hi, everybody
I didn't come to stay
I just came to let you know
The Piper's on his way

He goes off through each little town
And upon his harp he plays
And if you have a troubled heart
He'll wipe it right away

Hi, everybody
I didn't come to stay
I just came to let you know
The Piper's on his way

Up and down and through the town
The Piper plays today
Doors and windows open wide
To greet him on his way

Hi, everybody
I didn't come to stay
I just came to let you know
The Piper's on his way
