God bless the child, the child that's got his own
Them that's got shall get
them that's not you lose
So the bible says and it still is news
mama may have, papa may have
but God bless the child that got it's own
God bless the child that got it's own

Yes, the strong gets more
while the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
mama may have, papa may have
but God bless the child that got it's own
God bless the child that got it's own

When you've got money
you've got lots of friends
Crowding round the door
When it's gone spending ends
They don't come no more
Which relations give, crust of bread and such
You can help yourself but don't take too much

mama may have, papa may have
but God bless the child that got it's own
God bless the child that got it's own
