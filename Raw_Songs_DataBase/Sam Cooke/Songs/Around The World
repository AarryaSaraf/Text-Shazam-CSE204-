Around the world I searched for you
I traveled on but hope was gone
to keep a rendez-vous

I knew sometime, some place, some how
you'd look at me, and I would see the smile
you're smiling now

it might have been in ...
or in New York, or in Paris, or even London town
no longer will I go all around the world
for I've found my world in you

(with background vocals)
Around the world I searched for you
I traveled on but hope was gone
to keep a rendez-vous

I knew somewhere, some time, some how
you'd look at me, and I would see the smile
you're smiling now

it might have been in ...
or in New York, or in Paris, or even London town
no longer will I go all around the world
for I've found my world in you
I've found my world, found my world in you
