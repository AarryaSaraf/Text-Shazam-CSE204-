Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day, yeah

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day

Now listen while I tell you a story
A story about my girl
Oh I call her sugar dumpling because
She's the sweetest things in this world

Oh and whenever I-I'm feeling bad
Right away she puts me to bed
She hires two nurses, one to hold my hand
The other one to rub my head
Let 'em rub it, but

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day

Now whenever I'm hungry
I tell her fix me something to eat
And oh, she rushes in the kitchen and fixes me a dinner
With seven different kinds of meat
And oh, whenever I call at two in the morning
And say, come on over if you can
Before I hang up the telephone, ahe's sitting beside me
With a cup of coffee in her hand
Gimme that coffee 'cause

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day

Sugar dumpling, oh yeah...
