Whenever you kiss
I worry and wonder
Your lips maybe near
but where is your heart
It's always like this
I worry and wonder
You're close to me here
but where is your heart

It's a sad thing to realize
that you have a heart that never melts
when we kiss do your close you eyes
pretending that I'm someone else
You must break the spell
this cloud that I'm under
So please won't you tell
darling where is your heart

It's a sad thing to realize
that you have a heart that never melts
when we kiss do your close you eyes
pretending that I'm someone else
You must break the spell
this cloud that I'm under
So please won't you tell
darling where is your heart
