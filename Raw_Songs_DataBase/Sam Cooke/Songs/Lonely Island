I live on a lonely island in the heart of the city
I live on a lonely island there isn't any hope for me
I tell you my heart is broken, it's a shame have pity
I might as well be shipwrecked in the middle of the sea

Nobody will believe me
Nobody seems to care
How lonely, how lonely can you be
I walk around the city
My heart sends out a flare
Baby, baby, baby won't you rescue me
