Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
I know the sun's going to shine
In my back door someday

I got that trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living
Sometimes I feel like dying

Tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm going to lay,
On some lonesome, railroad line
And let two-ten train
Ease my trouble in mind

Meanwhile I got that
Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
I know the sun's going to shine
In my back door someday

If things don't get better
I'm going down to the river
I'm gonna take my old rocking chair
And if the blues overtake me
I'm gonna rock on away from here

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
I know the sun's going to shine
In my back door someday

I'm not worried cause I know
I know the sun's going to shine
In my back door someday

I know the sun's going to shine
In my back door someday
