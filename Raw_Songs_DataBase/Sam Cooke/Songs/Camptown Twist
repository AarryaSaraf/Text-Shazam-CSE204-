now the camptown ladies they sing this song (doo dah)
they say the camptown racetrack five miles long
I've come down here to see the horses run 
and if I don't make money I'll have some fun

because we're gonna twist all night
we're gonna twist all day
if I don't make some money I'll have some fun
twistin' the night away

now the longtailed filly and the big black horse
they tried too take a shortcut and couldn't get across
the black horse stick in a big muddy hole
and the filly wound up around a ten foot pole

I don't care
we're gonna twist all night
we're gonna twist all day
if I don't make some money I'll have some fun
twistin' the night away

you oughtta seem them fly on the ten mile heat
they go round the racetrack and then repeat
now I win my money and the bobtailed neck
I'm gonna keep my money in an old shoebag

we're gonna twist all night
we're gonna twist all day
since I done won this money I'm gonna have some fun
twistin' the night away

we're gonna twist all night
we're gonna twist all day
since I done won this money I'm gonna have some fun
twistin' the night away
