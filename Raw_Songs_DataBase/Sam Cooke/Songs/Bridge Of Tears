You told me you'd always love me
You told me, "Have no fears"
But you left me just standing
Standing on a bridge of tears

You left me so hurt and lonely
Now hours seem like years
I'll never find peace of mind
Standing on a bridge of tears

Those happy hours we spent
Planning our wedding day
Made me feel our love was real
Why did you go away?

I loved you, oh, how I love you
I need you, I need you here
Here beside me, to guide me
Guide me 'cross a bridge of tears

Those happy hours we spent
Planning our wedding day
Made me feel our love was real
Why, why did you go away?

I love you, oh, how I love you
I need you, I need you here
Here beside me, honey, just to guide me
Guide me 'cross my bridge of tears
(Guide me 'cross my bridge of tears)
