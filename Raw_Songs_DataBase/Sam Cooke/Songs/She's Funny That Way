Not much to look at,  nothing to see
I'm glad I'm living, and I'm lucky to be
But I got a woman crazy 'bout me
She's funny that way

ain't got a dollar, can't save a cent
She never holler, she'd live in a tent
I've got that woman mad about me
She's funny that way

 Though she loves to work and slave for me every day
 She'd be so much better off if I went away

But why should I leave her?, Why should I go?
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I've got that woman crazy 'bout me
She's funny that way

I've got that woman mad about me

she's funny that way
