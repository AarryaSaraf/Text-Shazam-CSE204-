I often think off the life I've led
And oh, it's a wonder I ain't dead
Drinking and gambling, staying out all night
Living in a fool's paradise

My mother told me, and Father told me too
Said my child, it'll all catch up with you
Drinking and gambling, staying out all night
Living in a fool's paradise

Though I've learned my lesson
Like all fools I've met
Oh, I've learned things in this life
That I haven't forgotten yet

My father told me, Mother said it right
Said my son, you're ruining your life
Drinking and gambling, staying out all night
Living in a fool's paradise
Oh, yeah, living in a fool's paradise
