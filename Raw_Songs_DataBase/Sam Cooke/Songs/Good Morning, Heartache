Good morning heartache
you ole gloomy sight
Good morning heartache
thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you were gone
Now here you are with the dawn
Wish I'd forget you but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by daying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
can't shake you, know how
just leave me alone
I've got the Monday blues
straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache
Here we go again
Good morning heartache
you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down
