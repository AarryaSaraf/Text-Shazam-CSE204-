(I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun)

I ain't gonna marry in the fall
I ain't gonna marry in the spring
Oh, for I am love with a pretty little girl
Who wears a diamond ring

And I am just a country boy, money have I none
Oh, but I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
I have gold in the morning sun

I never gonna kiss the ruby lips
Of the prettiest girl in town
Oh, I'm never gonna ask her if she'd marry me
'Cause I know she'd turn me down

'Cause I am just a country boy
Money, money have I none
Oh, but I've got that silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
I have gold in the morning sun
