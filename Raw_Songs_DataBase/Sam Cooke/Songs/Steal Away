Steal away, steal away, steal away
Steal away home
Steal away, steal away
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

Steal away, steal away, steal away
Steal away home
Steal away, steal away
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

My Lord he calls me, he calls me by the thunder
The trumpet sounds within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

Steal away, steal away, steal away
Steal away home
Steal away, steal away
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

Green trees bending
Poor man, he stands trembling
The trumpet sounds within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

Steal away, steal away, steal away
Steal away home
Steal away, steal away
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

Steal away, steal away, steal away
Steal away home.
