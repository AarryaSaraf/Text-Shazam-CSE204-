The moon belongs to everyone
Best things in life they're free
Stars belong to everyone
They cling there for you and for me

Flowers in spring
The robins that sings
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours and their mine

Love can come to everyone
Best things in life they're free

Moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life, they're free
Stars belong to everyone
They glitter there for you and for me
They are yours and me

Flowers in spring
The robins that sing
Sunbeams that shine
They're yours and their mine

Love can come to everyone
Best things in life they're free
All of the good things
Every one of the better things

The best, best things in life
They're free
