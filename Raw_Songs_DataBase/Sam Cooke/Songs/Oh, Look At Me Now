I never cared for simple things like love
June and old place
may face was terribly blank
Two things concerning l'amour
I'm really, really not for sure

For I'm not the guy who kid about love
For I'm not the guy who kid about fortunes and such
Never cared much, but, Oh look at me now
I never knew the technique of kissing
I never knew the thrill I could get from your touch
Never cared much, but, Oh look at me now

I'm a new man, better than Cassanova at his best
With a new heart a brand new start
I'm so proud I'm busting my best
So I'm a guy who turned out a lover
So I'm  guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Never cared much, but, Oh look at me now

I'm a new man, better than Cassanova at his best
With a new heart a brand new start
I'm so proud I'm busting my best
So I'm a guy who turned out a lover
So I'm  guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Never cared much, but, Oh look at me now
