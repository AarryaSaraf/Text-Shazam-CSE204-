Why do I love to walk with you?
To walk and talk with you?
Why do I feel that certain glow?
Why do I feel a thrill with you
Just sittin' still with you?

I know, I know
I know, I know, I know

'Cause you understand me
Yes, you understand me
You know exactly what I'm thinkin'
Exactly what I'm feelin'
I never have to say a word
A solitary word

'Cause you get the message
Yes, you get the message
No, you know exactly what I'm dreamin'
When stars are brightly gleamin'
Like no one in the world, the whole wide world
You understand me

Why do I love to date with you?
To stay up late with you?
Cuddling when the lights are low?
Why you're such a part of me?
Deep in the heart of me?

I know, I know
You bet your pretty life I know

You get the message
Yes, you get the message
Oh, you know exactly what I'm dreamin'
When stars are brightly gleamin'
Like no one in the world, the whole wide world
You understand me

I know, I know, I know, I know you understand me
Mmm, you understand me
I know, I know, I know you understand me
