Basin Street, Basin Street
That's the place where my friends all meet
Down in New Orleans
In that land of dreams
And you don't know how nice it seems

It's dear to me, yes-sir-ee
And that's the place I'm so longing to be
Where I can lose these old Basin Street Blues
No-o-o

Basin Street, my Basin Street
Where the young and the old folk meet
Down in New Orleans
In that land of dreams
You don't know how nice it really seems

But it's dear to me, yes-sir-ee
And that's the place I'm so longing to be
Where maybe I can lose
These old Basin Street Blues
Oh man I'm talking about

Basin Street, Basin Street
Where the folk who know what's happening meet
Down in New Orleans
In the land of dreams
And you don't know how nice it seems
Just how much it really means

Dear to me, yes-sir-ee
It's dear to me, yes-sir-ee
Can't you see why I wanna lose
These old Basin Street Blues
I wanna go where I can lose
These old Basin Street Blues
