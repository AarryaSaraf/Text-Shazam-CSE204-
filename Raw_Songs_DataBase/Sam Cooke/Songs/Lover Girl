I don't know why
but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something
I've never had
Never had no kissin', o
what I've been missing
Lover girl, o where can you be

The night is cold
and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul
just to call my own
got a moon above me
but no one to love
Lover girl, o where can you be

I've heard it said
that the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a pruger?
that you make love to me
Strange as it seems
someday we'll meet
and you dry all my tears
then whisper sweet little things in my ear
Hugging and kissing
oh what we've been missing
Lover girl, o where can you be
Lover girl, o where can you be
