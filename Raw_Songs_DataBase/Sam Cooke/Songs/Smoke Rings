Where do they go
Those smoke rings I blow each night?
Oh, what do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Why do they seem to picture a dream of love
And why do they fade, that phantom parade of love?

Puff, puff, puff, puff your cares away
Puff, puff, puff, night and day
Blow, blow them in the air
Silky little rings
Blow, blow them everywhere
Give your troubles wings!

Oh little smoke rings I love
Please take me above
Take me with you!
