// Far Away Places //

Far away places with strange sounding names
Far away over the sea
Those far away places with strange sounding names
Are calling, calling me

Goin' to China, or maybe Siam
I wanna see for myself
Those far away places
I've been reading about
In a book that I took from a shelf

I start getting restless whenever I hear
The whistle of a train
I pray for the day I can get underway
And look for those castles in Spain

They call me a dreamer well maybe I am
But I know that I'm burning to see
Those for away places with strange sounding names
Calling, calling me

Calling, calling me

// Under Paris Skies //

Stranger beware
There's love in the air
Under Paris skies
Try to be smart
And don't let your heart catch on fire
Love becomes king
The moment it's spring
Under Paris skies
Lonely hearts meet
Somewhere on the street of desire

Parisian love can bloom
High in a skylight room
Or in a gay cafe where hundreds of people can see

I wasn't smart
And I lost my heart
Under Paris skies
Don't ever be a heartbroken stranger like me

Oh I fell in love
yes I was a fool
for Paris can be
so beautifully cruel
Paris is just a gay coquette
who longs to love and then regret
stranger beware there's love in the air

Just look and see what happened to me
Under Paris skies
watch what you do
the same thing can happen to you

// South Of The Border (Down Mexico Way) //

Ai-ai-ai-ai
oh-oh-oh-oh
ai-ai-ai-ai
oh-oh-oh-oh

south of the border
down Mexico way
that's where I fell in love 
when stars above came out to play

and now as I wonder
my thoughts ever stray
south of the border
down Mexico way

she was the picture
in old Spanish lace
just for a tender while
I kissed the smile
upon her face
for it was siesta
and we were so gay
south of the border
down Mexico way

then she sighed as she whispered manana
never dreaming that we were parting
and I lied as I whisperd manana
for our tomorrow never came

south of the border
I rode back one day
there in a veil of white by candlelight
she kneeled to pray
the missionbells told me
that I musn't stay
south of the border
down mexico way

Ai-ai-ai-ai
oh-oh-oh-oh

// Bali Ha'i //

Bali Ha'i may call you 
any night, any day
In your heart you'll hear it call you
Come away, come away

Bali Ha'i will whisper 
on the wind of the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me 

Your own special hopes
your own special dreams
Bloom on the hillside 
and shine in the streets
If you try you'll find me 
where the sky meets the sea
Here am I your special island
come to me, come to me

Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i

If you try you'll find me 
where the sky meets the sea
here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me

Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i

// The Coffee Song (They've Got An Awful Lot Of Coffee In Brazil) //

Way down among the Brazilians,
Coffee beans grow by the billions,
So they've got to find those extra cups to fill,
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil.

You can't get cherry soda,
'Cause they've got to sell their quota,
And the way things are I guess they never will,
They've got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil,
No tea or tomato juice,
You'll see no potato juice,
'Cause the planters down in Santos all say No! No! No!

A politician's daughter,
Was accused of drinking water,
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill,
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil.

A politician's daughter,

And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill,

// Arrivederci, Roma (Goodbye To Rome) //

Arrivederci Roma,
Goodbye, goodbye to Rome

City of a million moonlit places
City of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one of all the faces
Far from home

Arrivederci Roma
It's time for us to part

Save the wedding bells for my returning
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning in her heart

City of a million moonlit places
City of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one of all the faces
Far from home

Arrivederci Roma
It's time for us to part

Save the wedding bells for my returning
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning in her heart

Arrivederci roma,
Roma, roma, roma

// London By Night //

London by night is a wonderful sight
there is magic a brawl in the air
I'm often told that the street turn to gold
when the moon shines on circus and square
deep in the dark that envelops the park
there's a man and his cigarette's low
down by the Thames, lights that sparkle like gems
seem to wink at each girl and her boy

up comes the moon when the city's asleep
he's not alone for it sings
somewhere up there stands an angel to keep her watch
while each Londener dreams

my love and I saw the sun leave the sky
then we kissed in the fast fading light
most people say they love London by day
but lovers love London by night

most people they love London by day
but lovers love London by night

// Jamaica Farewell //

Down the way where the night are gay
And the sun shines dearly on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
I won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a girl in Kingston Town

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swing to and fro
I must declare my love to is there
Tough I've from Maine to Mexico

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
I won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a girl in Kingston Town

Down at the market you can hear
Ladies crying out while on their heads they bear
Ackee rice, salt fish on ice and
the rum is fine any time of year

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
I won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a girl in Kingston Town

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
I won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a girl in Kingston Town

// Galway Bay //

If you ever go across the seas to Ireland
Then maybe at the closing of your day
You will sit and watch the moonrise over Claddagh
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay

To hear again the ripple of the trout stream
The women in the meadows making hay
To sit beside the turf fire in the cabin
And watch the barefoot goosoons at their play

For the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways
They scorned us just for being what we are
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams
Or light a penny candle from a star

And if there's going to be a life hereafter
And somehow I am sure there's going to be
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven
In that dear land across the Irish Sea

// Sweet Leilani //

Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flower
Nature fashioned roses kissed with dew
And then she placed them in a bower
It was the start of you.
Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flower
I dreamed of paradise for two.
You are my paradise completed.
You are my dream come true.

Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flower
I dreamed of paradise for two.
You are my paradise completed.
You are my dream come true.

You are my paradise completed.
You are my dream come true.

// The Japanese Farewell Song //

The time has come for us to say sayonara
my heart will always be yours for eternity
I knew some time we'd have to say sayonara
please promise that you'll be returning someday to me

I'll remember our romance until the day that I die
I'll see your face in the moon and stars in the sky
so, hold me close before you say sayonara
and promise that you'll always keep me near to your heart

I'll remember our romance until the day that I die
I'll see your face in the moon and stars in the sky
so, hold me close before you say sayonara
and promise that you'll always keep me near to your heart
always keep me near to your heart

// The House I Live In //

the house I live in
a plot of earth, a street
the grocer and the butcher
and the people that I meet
the children in the playground
the faces that I see
all races, all religions
that's a miracle to me

the place I work in
the worker at my side
the little town or city
where my people lived and died
the howdie and the handshake
the air of feeling free
the right to speak my mind out
that's a miracle to me

the things I see about me
the big things and the small
the little corner newsstand
and the howls a mile tall
the wedding in the churchyard
the laughter and the tears
the dream that's been a-growing for a 150 year

the town I live in
the street, the house, the room
the pavement of the city
are a garden all in bloom
the church the school the clubhouse
the million lights I see
but especially the people
that's a miracle to me
