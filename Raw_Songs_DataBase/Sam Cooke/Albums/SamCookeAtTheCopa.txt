// When I Fall In Love //

Maybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you

// Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out //

Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends
And I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again,
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you
Their your old long-lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

// The Best Things In Life Are Free //

The moon belongs to everyone
Best things in life they're free
Stars belong to everyone
They cling there for you and for me

Flowers in spring
The robins that sings
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours and their mine

Love can come to everyone
Best things in life they're free

Moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life, they're free
Stars belong to everyone
They glitter there for you and for me
They are yours and me

Flowers in spring
The robins that sing
Sunbeams that shine
They're yours and their mine

Love can come to everyone
Best things in life they're free
All of the good things
Every one of the better things

The best, best things in life
They're free

// Bill Bailey //

it's time you went home, Bill Bailey
it's time you went home
you got a woman there that moans the whole night long
she said she'd do the cooking, Billy
said she'd pay the rent
she realizes that she done you wrong, yeah

stop thinking about that lonely evening
that she drove you out
with nothing but a fine toothcomb
oh then I know that's a shame, Bill
maybe you're the blame, Bill
so Bailey go on home

it's time you went home Bill Bailey
it's time you home
you got a woman there she's moaning and a groaning
the whole night long
said she'd do that cooking, Billy
pay the telephone bill and the rent
she realizes that she done you wrong

stop thinking about that lonely evening
that she drove you out
and remember, remember she didn't let you leave
without that fine tooth comb

And I know, I know
I know it's a shame
maybe you're to blame, Bill
and Bailey won't you go on home
Bailey won't you get on home
Bailey go on home

// Frankie And Johnny //

Frankie and Johnny was sweethearts
At least that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports car to his Ivy League clothes

Aw, he was a man alright
Oh, but he was doing her wrong
Just to show you what can happen

A friend came running to Frankie
She said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man ridin' in his Jaguar
With a chick named Nellie Blye

Oh, if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

Frankie ran around the corner
And peeked in a swinging place
And there she saw Johnny with a woman
He had his arms around her waist

Aw...he was a man alright
But Frankie could see that he was
Doing her wrong
And oh let me tell you

Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long forty-four
She shot once, twice, three times
And Johnny fell on the hard wood floor

Aw...he was a man alright
But she shot him because he was doing her wrong

But the last thing he told her was
Frankie, you know I love you
Why? Honey, why did you do that?
Frankie, I was telling her about you
Frankie, you know I love you
Frankie, you know that I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now Frankie, you know good and well that I love you
Frankie, I'll always love you baby
Frankie, you know I can't do without you
Frankie, you know I love you
And I know, and I know I was doing wrong
You wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
Frankie, baby, you know I love you
Frankie...

// Medley: Try A Little Tenderness / (I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons / You Send Me //

[Try a Little Tenderness]

Oh she may be weary
Women do get wearied
Wearing that same old shaggy dress
And oh when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness,

You won't regret it, no no
Young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness, yeah
But it's all so easy
try a little tenderness 


[(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons]

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart

I love you and you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart


[You Send Me]

Darling you send me. I know you send me
Honest you do [x3]
You thrill me, I know you thrill me
Darling you thrill me
Honest you do
Honest you do
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But it lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
to marry you and take you home

You Send Me [x3]
Honest you do

Whenever I'm with you
Whenever I'm near you
Honest you do
I know when you hold me,
whenever you kiss me

Amen

This little light of mine,
I'm going to let it shine.
This little light of mine,

even in my home, I'm gonna let is shine
I let is shine to show my love

when I see my neighbor coming
I'm gonna let it shine

Amen

// Blowin' In The Wind //

How many roads must a man walk down
Before he's called a man
Tell me, how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Tell me, how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
No, the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer: blowin' in the wind

How many times must a man look above
Before he sees the sky
Tell me, how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
What I wanna know is
How many deaths will it take 'til he knows
Too many people have died
Oh, the 
No, the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer: somewhere in the the wind

How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed out to the sea
Tell me, how many years can people exist
Before they are allowed to be free
How many times can a man turn his head
Pretending that he just doesn't see
Oh, the answer, my friend, blowin' in whe wind
The answer: blowin' in the wind

Blowin' in the wind, blowin' in the wind
The answer: somewhere in the wind
That answer is somewhere in the wind
