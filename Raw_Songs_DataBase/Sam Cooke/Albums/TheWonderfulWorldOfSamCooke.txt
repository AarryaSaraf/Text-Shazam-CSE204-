// Desire Me //

Desire me, desire me
As I desire you
Desire me and want me
That's all I ever ask of life
That you will someday come to me
And say that you love me
As I love you
Hmm

Desire me and tell me
That you are mine and mine alone
Desire me and love me
And be the queen upon my throne
For I will always worship you
No matter where you go or what you do

There comes a time in the life of every boy
When one and only one girl will do
So now the time has come
And I know that you're the one
And all that I will ever want is you

So desire me desire me
That's all I ever ask of you
Desire me and love and tell me that you want me too
For nothing else will matter in the world
As long as I am close to you

There comes a time
In the life of every boy
When one and only one girl will do
So now the time has come
And I know that you're the one
And all that I will ever want is you
So now the time has come
And I know you are the one
And all that I will ever want is you

// That's Heaven To Me //

The things that I see
As I walk along the street
That's heaven to me

A little flower that blooms in May
A lovely sunset at the end of a day
Someone helping a stranger along the way
That's heaven to me

The feeling I have when I hear a touching prayer
Makes me know, a God is somewhere near
Even the birds flying around in the air
That's heaven to me

It doesn't have to be a miracle
For me to see
The goodness of my God
Is everywhere to me, oh woah

Even the children playing in the street
Sayin' a friendly hello to everyone they meet
Even the leaves blowing out on the trees
That's heaven to me

// No One //

Oh how I love you
every moment I can see your face
Oh how I love you
no one, no one could ever
never will take your place

oh how I love you
every moment I know I see your face
oh how I love you
no one could ever take your place

every morning when I rise
I can almost see you standing before my eyes
and every night when I go to sleep
my prayer is our love will keep
I long to see your smiling face
I long to feel your warm embrace
how could anyone ever take your place

oh how I love you
every moment I know I see your
oh how I love you
no one could ever take your place
oh how I love you

// With You //

With you
With you, although I am poor, I feel like a king
With you
With you, though I have nothing, I feel I have everything

But without you my dreams will soon fade away
I'd be here crying day after day, ohh
Promise me you'll never, never, never
Never leave me

Oh, when I'm with you
With you, oh life means everything to me
With you
With you, just like a child, I'm happy as I can be

But without you I'm lost like a child left alone
Crying for its mother and wishing she was home
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know you'll never, never, never leave me

Ohh, you are my love
For your wonderful, wonderful, wonderful love, I live
You are my life
For your wonderful love my life I'd gladly give

For only when I'm with you
With you, oh do I, do I, do I feel the way that I do
With you
With you, I found, I found, I found, I found the love that's always true

But without you I'm lost, so you find my way
I'd be here crying day after day, ohh
Promise, promise, promise me you'll never
Never leave me

// Blue Moon //

Blue moon,
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
You heard me sing a prayer
For someone I really care for

Then suddenly there appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold
Then I heard somebody whisper:
"Please adore me!" and when I looked
The moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

// Stealing Kisses //

Stealing kisses, precious kisses
You should be ashamed, I trust in you
Stealing kisses, someone's kisses
Starting a romance that wasn't meant for you

I begged and begged you to be careful
But you were always acting smart
You kept on
Stealing kisses, precious kisses
And suddenly you stole my heart

(Stealing kisses, precious kisses)
You should be ashamed I trusted you
(Stealing kisses, someone's kisses)
Starting a romance that wasn't meant for you
(I begged and begged you to be careful)
But you were always acting so smart

Stealing kisses, precious kisses
You should be ashamed, I trust in you
Stealing kisses, someone's kisses
Starting a romance that wasn't meant for you

But now I wish we never, never, never part
Stealing kisses, someone's kisses
And suddenly you stole my heart

// There I've Said It Again //

(love you, love you)
I love you, there's nothing to hide
It's better than burning inside
I love you, no use to pretend
There I've said it again
I've said it, what more can I say
Believe me, There's no other way
I just love you and will to the end
There I've said it again

I tried to drum up,
A frase that would sum up
All that I feel, that I feel for you
But what good are frazes
The thought that amazes
Is you love me and it's so heavenly
Forgive me, for wanting you so
There's one thing I want you to know
[?] and that I love you so
Heaven knows when
There I've said it again
There I've said it again

// I Thank God //

this wonderful world we live in
is God's masterpiece of art
and I live each golden moment
with his love in my heart

I thank God
for blessing me
with eyes to see
each wondrous day
and I thank God
for hands to help
my fellow man along the way

he gave me lips to speak the simple truth
and ears to hear to magic dreams of youth
I thank God for giving me
his blessed book with words divine
for now I know dear God I know
the miracle of life is mine

yes Dear God I know
the miracle of life is mine
