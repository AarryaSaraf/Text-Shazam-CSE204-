// Tammy //

I hear the cottonwoods whispering above 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's in love! 
The old hootie owl hootie-hoo's to the dove 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's in love! 
Does my darling feel what I feel 
When he comes near? 
My heart beats so joyfully 
you'd think that he could hear! 
Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of! 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's in love! 

Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, you and I know 
Tammy! Tammy! Can't let him go! 
The breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring low 
Tammy! Tammy! You love him so! 
When the night is warm, soft and warm 
I long for his charms! 
I'd sing like a violin 
if I were in his arms 
Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of! 
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love!

// The Gypsy //

In a quaint caravan there's a lady they call the gypsy
She can look in the future and drive away all your fears
Everyone of your fears
Everything will come right if you'll only believe the gypsy
She could tell at a glance that my heart was so full of tears

She looked in my hand and told me my love was always true
But yet in my hearts I knew dear somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again cause I want to believe the gypsy
That my lover is true and will come back to me someday

She looked in my hand and told me my love was always true
But yet in my hearts I knew dear somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again cause I want to believe the gypsy
That my lover is true and will come back to me someday

// Almost In Your Arms //

You're here, that moment's near,
I'm almost in your arms
Tonight, the mood is right,
I'm almost in your arms

One sigh, one word
and I will rush to your embrace
Say that certain word,
sigh that certain sigh
And with all my heart,
to your arms I'll fly
It's strange, how we are changed
by things that seem so small
One look can write a book,
one touch can say it all

We know those nights alone,
and now we found our way
I'm almost in your arms,
nearly in your arms to stay

[repeat first and last verse]

// You're Always On My Mind //

You're always my mind
Instilled in my heart
You're always on my mind
Although we are apart
You're always, always
Always on my mind

Baby, the reason why I know
I can't forget your face
Cause everywhere I go
I see you everyplace
You're always, always
Always on my mind

Life is so empty
Along with a broken heart
Please, please tell me
Honey, why did we have to part

You know it's you I love
To my heart you hold the key
I pray the stars above
That you hurry back to me
You're always, always
You're always on my mind

// Try A Little Love //

Be nice to her whenever you can
And when you cross the street
Always, always hold her hand
You'll find out, oh just a little love
Goes a long way

So, smile at her
When she does something wrong
Always be there to pick her up
And to make her strong
You'll find out a little love

If you be kind, sometimes she'll be blind
To the wrong things that you might do
If you treat her good
The way that you should
She'll see the goodness in you

So, be sweet to her and gentle too
Then you will find out what
Just a little, a little love can do
You'll find out that a little love goes a long way

If you treat her kind, sometimes she'll be blind
To the wrong things
The wrong things you might do
If you treat her good
The way that you should
She'll see the goodness in you

So, be sweet to her and gentle too
And you'll find out what
A little love can go
You'll find out, find out, find out
A little love can go a long, long way

// Don't Cry On My Shoulder //

Don't cry on my shoulder
For somebody else
While I'm dancing this dance with you
O, don't cry on my shoulder
About someone you knew
I told you I am in love with you

You try to tell me that
You love me yet
How come while were dancing
Our eyes never met

Don't cry on my shoulder
For somebody else
While I'm dancing this dance with you

And oh pretty baby
Don't cry on my shoulder
For somebody else
While I'm dancing this twist with you

And oh, pretty baby
O, don't cry on my shoulder
About someone you knew
I told you I am in love
At least I mean to tell you I am on love with you

Ah, you try to tell me that
You love me yet
How come while were dancing
Our eyes never met

Don't cry on my shoulder
For somebody else
While I'm dancing this dance with you

Do that thing one more time

// Bridge Of Tears //

You told me you'd always love me
You told me, "Have no fears"
But you left me just standing
Standing on a bridge of tears

You left me so hurt and lonely
Now hours seem like years
I'll never find peace of mind
Standing on a bridge of tears

Those happy hours we spent
Planning our wedding day
Made me feel our love was real
Why did you go away?

I loved you, oh, how I love you
I need you, I need you here
Here beside me, to guide me
Guide me 'cross a bridge of tears

Those happy hours we spent
Planning our wedding day
Made me feel our love was real
Why, why did you go away?

I love you, oh, how I love you
I need you, I need you here
Here beside me, honey, just to guide me
Guide me 'cross my bridge of tears
(Guide me 'cross my bridge of tears)

// I Fall In Love Every Day //

Ooh, ooh

I fall in love every day
I fall in love each
And every day
Each time I see you
I fall in love with you
Every day (Ooh), mmm

I get a thrill every day (Ooh, ooh)
I always will each
And every day (Ooh, ooh)
Each time I see you
I want to be with you
Every day (Ooh)

This happens every day
(Every day, every day), oh, oh
When you walk by my way
(By my way, by my way), mhm
If I could only say
(Only say, only say)
How much I'm in love you (Oh)

I fall every day (Ooh, ooh)
I fall in love each
And every day (Ooh, ooh)
Each time I see you
I fall in love with you
Every day (Ooh)

Ooh, ooh

// When A Boy Falls In Love //

I've heard them say love was a wonderful things
Something you couldn't hide on a shelf
But for me they no longer have to explain
Because I know for myself

He awakens each morn with a smile on his face
When a boy is in love (Boy is in love)
And the world to him is a beautiful place
When a boy is in love
He's up and he's gone
There's no breakfast for him
'Cause he lives on the love of his sweet little gem
The days not through, though it's not very long
Before he must talk to his girl on the phone
That's how it is when a boy falls in love

His girl's voice on the phone brings him wondrous delight
When a boy is in love (Boy is in love)
If there's been any darkness, it all fades from sight
When a boy's in love
He can hardly wait 'til the moment they meet
For he knows when he sees her his day will be complete
When they're finally alone and he kisses her lips
The world sings a love song and his heart turns a flip
That's how it is when a boy falls in love

At the end of the day the time comes they must part
The strings of regret tear away at his heart
And late in the night as he sleeps on his bed
Visions of her sweet song, how they dance in his head
And before you know he is buying a ring
To capture forever that sweet darling thing

That's how it is when a boy falls in love
Whoa, that's how it is when a boy falls in love
That's how it is

// To Each His Own //

To each his own
To each his own
And my own is you

A rose must remain with the sun and the rain
Or its lovely promise won't come true
To each his own, to each his own
And my own is you

What good is a song if the words don't belong
And a dream must be a dream for two?
No good alone to each his own
And for me, there's you

If a flame is to grow, there must be a glow
To open each door, there's a key
I need you, I know, I can't let you go
Your touch means too much to me

Honey, two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I've found my own
One and only you (To each his own)

My own is you (To each his own)
My own is you (To each his own)
Tell you, you're my own (To each his own)
Honey, my own is you (To each his own)
My, my, my own is you (To each his own)

// Little Things You Do //

Love without devotion
Can never be true
You can show emotion
In the little things you do
Words when kindly spoken
Can make dreams seem true
But more than words can say
Are the little things you do
(The little things you do)

A tender touch can mean so much
A card, a letter when away
Each little smile is so worthwhile
To show affection each day
Love can be so tender and always be true
But love must have assurance
By those little things you do
(Love must have assurance and you can make it true)
By the little tings you do
