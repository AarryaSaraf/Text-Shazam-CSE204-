// Nobody Knows The Trouble I've Seen //

Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Glory hallelujah

Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Nobody knows my, my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Glory hall - glory hallelujah

Sometimes I'm up and sometimes I'm down
Oh, yes Lord
You know sometimes I'm almost to the ground
Oh, oh yes Lord

Still, nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Nobody, nobody knows my, my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Glory hallelujah

If you get there before I do
Oh, oh yes Lord
Don't forget to tell all my friends I'm comin' too
Whoa, oh yes Lord

Still, nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Glory hall - hallelujah

// Lost And Lookin' //

I'm lost and lookin' for my baby
Wonder why my baby can't be found
I'm lost and lookin' for my baby
Lord knows my baby ain't around

So I'm lost and lookin' for my baby
Wonder why my baby can't be found
Lost and searching for my baby
Lord knows my baby ain't around

Crying for my baby
Crying all alone
Calling for you
Come home, come home

I'm lost and a-calling for my baby
Baby, won't you please come home
I'm lost and a-calling for my baby
I need you 'cause I'm so alone

// Mean Old World //

This is a mean old world to live in all by yourself
This is a mean old world to live in all by yourself
This is a mean world to be alone
Without someone to call your own
This is a mean old world to try and live in all by yourself

I wish I had someone, someone who'd love me true
I wish I had someone, who loved me true
If I had someone who loved me true
Then I know I wouldn't be so blue
This is a mean old world to try and live in all by yourself

Lord, this is a mean old world to live in all by yourself
Mean old world to try and live in all by yourself
This is a mean world to be alone
Without someone to call your own
Lord, mean world to try and live in all by yourself

Sometimes I find myself dreaming I found a love
Sometimes I find myself dreaming I found a love
Sometimes I dream I really found a love
Someone who loved me true as the stars above
For this is a mean old world to try and live in all by yourself

// Please Don't Drive Me Away //

Baby, please
Don't you drive me away
Baby, please
Don't you drive me away

Now, you know I want you, need you by my side
My love for you I'll never hide
Now, if you love me you will hear my plea
Put me out and that's the end of me
Baby, please
Don't you drive me away

One more thing, honey
You know I want you, I love you so
I'll never, never, never, never, never let you go

Baby, please
Don't you drive me away

Oh, yeah
Oh, please
Please don't you drive me away
Don't you hear me telling you
Oh, don't you drive me away

Let me tell you
You know I need you, want you by my side
My love for you I'll never hide
If you love me, won't you hear my plea
Put me out and that's the end of me

Baby, please 
Don't you drive me away

// I Lost Everything //

I lost everything
When I lost you
Now my heart is breaking in two

I found memories
What am I to do
Those memories keep on making me blue

The moon and the stars
They don't seem the same
Love has lost its glory
To me it's just a game

No, I lost everything
My dreams are all through
My life is only make-believe without you
Oh, my life is only make-believe without you

// Get Yourself Another Fool //

Oh, at last I've awaken
To see what you've done
What can I do
But pack up and run

Now, I know the rules
Get yourself another fool

You said that you love me
I was yours to command
But your kind of love
My heart couldn't stand

Use me for a tool
Get yourself another fool

And now, now that we're through
You say you meant to be true
Oh, but deep down in your heart I know
That our love could never grow

I tried to believe you
That we'd never part
But your kind of love
Broke my poor heart

No I know the rules
Get yourself another fool

Get yourself another fool

// Laughin' And Clownin' //

Laughin' and clownin'
Just to keep from cryin'
I'm laughin' and clownin'
Just to keep from cryin'

I keep on tryin' to hide the fact
I've got a worried mind

Let me tell you, being life of the party
Seemed to be my role
Since you left me, baby, being life of the party
Seemed to be my role

I keep on tryin' to hide my feelings
Trying to hide my soul

Let me tell you what I do, I stand in the doorway
Watchin' all the girls go through
You might not believe me, baby, but I stand in the doorway
Watchin' all the girls go through

I keep on tryin' to me find someone
To take my mind off you, tickle 'em for me

I keep on laughin' and clownin'
To take my mind off you

// Trouble Blues //

So many days since you went away
I often think of you night and day
But I know that someday, someday darling
I won't be trouble no more

Trouble, trouble and misery
Is about to get the best of me
But I know that someday, oh someday darling
I won't be trouble no more

I told you my story, I sang my song
About you leaving baby, you know that's wrong
But oh, someday, someday darling
I won't be trouble no more

// You Gotta Move //

You gotta move, you gotta move
Baby, you gotta move
If you keep on mistreatin' me, baby
You gotta move
If you keep on doggin' me, baby
You gotta move

My mother told me long time ago
Watch out for women, oh, they hurt you so
And if you keep on hurting me like you're doing
You gotta move

I said you gotta move
You gotta move
Move on, you gotta move

Let me tell you, baby, I love you, baby, to my heart
You keep on mistreatin' me baby, oh, we got to part
I hate to let you go, baby
But oh, you gotta move

Let me tell you one more time, you gotta move
Gotta move, get away from me
Baby, oh, you gotta move
Now if you keep on hurting my heart gal
You gotta move

One more time, move one
You gotta move from me baby
You gotta move, I hate to let you go, baby
But oh, you gotta move

// Fool's Paradise //

I often think off the life I've led
And oh, it's a wonder I ain't dead
Drinking and gambling, staying out all night
Living in a fool's paradise

My mother told me, and Father told me too
Said my child, it'll all catch up with you
Drinking and gambling, staying out all night
Living in a fool's paradise

Though I've learned my lesson
Like all fools I've met
Oh, I've learned things in this life
That I haven't forgotten yet

My father told me, Mother said it right
Said my son, you're ruining your life
Drinking and gambling, staying out all night
Living in a fool's paradise
Oh, yeah, living in a fool's paradise

// Shake Rattle And Roll //

Get out of that bed, go wash your face and hands
Get out of that bed, go wash your face and hands
Get into that kitchen make some noise with the pots and pans
And all you're wearing them dresses the sun come shining through
Yeah all you're wearing them dresses the sun come shining through
I can't believe my eyes all of that belong to you

Now I believe to my soul you're the Devil in nylon hose
Listen, I believe to my soul you're the Devil in nylon hose
Oh, you won't do right to save your, not your soul

And all you want to do is, shake rattle and roll
Every morning, shake rattle and roll
With the feeling, shake rattle and roll
Sing the line kids, shake rattle and roll
Every morning, shake rattle and roll
Oh you're doing it, shake rattle and roll

I'm like a one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store, you don't hear me
I'm like a one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store
I can look at you and tell ya there ain't no time no more

Everybody sing it, shake rattle and roll
Let me hear you, shake rattle and roll
A little louder, shake rattle and roll
With the feeling, shake rattle and roll
Got the feeling, shake rattle and roll
It's good to me, shake rattle and roll

Everybody sing it, shake rattle and roll
A little louder, shake rattle and roll
Make me feel it, shake rattle and roll
Love to sing it, shake rattle and roll
Everybody, shake rattle and roll
Sing the song now, shake rattle and roll

One more time now, shake rattle and roll
Let me hear you do it, shake rattle and roll
Sing out your song now, shake rattle and roll
Oh, I like to do it, shake rattle and roll
Everybody sing it, shake rattle and roll
Everybody dancing, shake rattle and roll

Oh yeah, shake rattle and roll
Don't you love it, shake rattle and roll
Make you feel good, shake rattle and roll
With the feeling, shake rattle and roll
Everybody sing it, shake rattle and roll
Oh yeah, shake rattle and roll
One more time now, shake rattle and roll
Shake rattle and roll
