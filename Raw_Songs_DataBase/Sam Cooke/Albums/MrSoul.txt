// I Wish You Love //

I wish you bluebirds in the spring
to give your heart a son to sing.
And then a kiss oh but more than this,
I wish you love.

And in July a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade.
I wish you health oh and more than wealth. I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree that you and I will never be.
So with my best my very best I am ' setn' you free
Oh honey.

I wish you shelter from the storm.
A cozy fire to keep you worm.
Oh but most of all I wish you love.
But most of all when snowflakes fall I wish you love.
But most of all when snowflakes fall I wish you love.

// Willow Weep For Me //

Willow weep for me,
Willow weep for me,
Bend your branches green,
Along the stream that runs to sea.
Listen to my plea,
Listen willow and weep for me.

Gone my lover's dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here
To weep my tears into the stream.
Sad as I can be,
Hear me willow and weep for me.

Whisper to the wind,
And say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a breaking
And making a moan
Murmur to the night,
To hide her starry light,
So none will find me sighing
And crying, all alone.

Oh weeping willow tree,
Weep, in sympathy,
Bend your branches down
Along the ground and cover me,
When the shadows fall,
Bend oh willow and weep for me.

// Chains Of Love //

Chains of love
Have tied my heart to you
Chains of love
Have made me feel so blue
Now that I'm your prisoner
Tell me what you're gonna do

What I wanna know is
Are you gonna leave me
Are you gonna make me cry
Tell me baby
Are you gonna leave me
Are you gonna make me cry
The chains are gonna haunt me
Until the day I die

Let me tell you right now
If you're gonna leave me
Please wont you set me free, pretty baby
If you're gonna leave me
Please wont you set me free
Cause I can't stand these chains around me
Unless you're here with me

In conclusion let me tell you honey
It's three o'clock in the morning
And oh, the moon is shining bright
One more time now
Three o'clock in the morning
The moon is shining bright
And O I just sit and wonder
Where can you be again tonight

// Smoke Rings //

Where do they go
Those smoke rings I blow each night?
Oh, what do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Why do they seem to picture a dream of love
And why do they fade, that phantom parade of love?

Puff, puff, puff, puff your cares away
Puff, puff, puff, night and day
Blow, blow them in the air
Silky little rings
Blow, blow them everywhere
Give your troubles wings!

Oh little smoke rings I love
Please take me above
Take me with you!

// All The Way //

when somebody loves you 
its no good unless he loves you
all the way
happy to be near you
when you need someone to cheer you
all the way
taller than the tallest tree is
know thats how it s gotta feel
deeper than the deep blue see is
that how deep it goes if it is real, baby

when somebody needs you its no good
unless he needs you
all the way
through all the good and lean years
and all the in between years
come what may
how knows where the road will lead us
and only a fool would say
but if you let me love you
its for sure I am gonna love you
all the way
all the way

who knows where the road will lead us
only a fool would say

but if you let me love you
its for sure I am gonna love you
all the way

// Send Me Some Lovin' //

Send me some lovin'
Oh send it I pray
How can I love you
When you're far away?

Send me your picture
Send it my dear
So I can hold it
Pretend you are here

Can you send me your kisses? 
I still feel their touch
I need you so badly
I miss you so much

My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waitin' for you

// Cry Me A River //

Now you say you're lonely
You cry the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was true, too plebeian being
Told me you were through with me and

And now you say you love me
Well just prove you do
Come and cry me a river
Cry cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you

Come on and cry me a river
Cry cry me a river
I cried a river over you

// Driftin' Blues //

I'm driftin'
I'm driftin'
Like a ship out on the sea
I'm driftin'
I'm driftin'
I'm driftin'
Like a ship out on the sea
No, I ain't got nobody
In the world to care for me

If my baby would only take me back again, back again
If my baby would only take me back again, back again

I know I'm a good for nothing
And I haven't got no friends
Listen to me, honey
I gave you all my money
Tell me tell me tell me tell me
What more can I do
Didn't I give to u all my money?
Now tell me what more can I do!
I'll realize you're a good little girl
But it seems that you won't be true

Seems like I got to tell you
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Listen to me
I know you gonna miss me
This time you gonna be 
The one to cry

// For Sentimental Reasons //

I love you
For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my
Given you my heart because I mmm you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

I think of you every morning
I dream of you every night
And I know I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

I know I love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And tell we'll never part

I think of you every morning
Can I help it if I dream of you every night
No, no, no, no, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

I know that I love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And tell we will never part

My darling I love you
I love you

// Little Girl //

Little girl
You're the one girl for me
Little girl
You're as sweet as can be

Just a glance at you meant
Love from the start
And oh, what a thrill came
Into my heart

Little girl
With your cute little ways
I am yours
For the rest of my days

And this great big world
Will be divine
Little girl
When you are mine, oh mine, yeah

And this great big world
Will be divine
Little girl
When you're mine, oh mine

// These Foolish Things //

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin' words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

let me tell you
first daffodils and all excited cables
and candlelights on little corner tables
and still my heart has wings
These foolish things
Remind me of you

The park at evening and scented roses
and waiters whistling as the last bar closes
the beauty that is spring springs

How strange, how sweet, to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you so near to me

The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
These foolish things
Remind me of you
