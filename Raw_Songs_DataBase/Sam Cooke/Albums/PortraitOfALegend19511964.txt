With your daddy and mommy standing by

// Wonderful World //

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for

But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be

Now, I don't claim to be an A student
But I'm trying to be
For maybe by being an A student, baby
I can win your love for me

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be

La ta ta ta ta ta ta (History)
Hmm-mm-mm (Biology)

Yeah, but I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be

// You Were Made For Me //

A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sale on the sea
As sure as there are stars above,
I know I know you were made for me
You were made for me.
A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there are stars above,
I know I know you were made for me

We'll have our quarrels and you will upset me
But what can I do?
You've been mine ever since I met you and I'll never leave you
No I'll never leave you
As sure as there's a heaven up above me,
From you I know I'll never be free.
As sure as there are stars above,
I know I know you were made for me.

// Chain Gang //

(Hoh! Ah!) I hear something saying (Hoh! Ah!)

(Hoh! Ah!)(Well don't you know)
That's the sound of the men,
Working on the chain, ga-ang

All day long they work so hard till the sun is going down
Working on the highways and byways and wearing, wearing a frown
You hear they moaning their lives away
Then you hear somebody say

Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men,
Working on the chain, gang

But meanwhile I gotta work right here

// Twistin' The Night Away //

Let me tell you 'bout a place
Somewhere up-a New York way
Where the people are so gay
Twistin' the night away
Here they have a lot of fun
Puttin' trouble on the run
Man, you find the old and young
Twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin'
Everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin'
They're twistin' the night away

Here's a man in evening clothes
How he got here, I don't know, but
Man, you oughta see him go
Twistin' the night away
He's dancin' with a chick in slacks
She's movin' up and back
Oh, man, there ain't nothin' like
Twistin' the night away

They're twistin' the night

Dancin' with an older queen
Who's dolled up in her diamond rings and
Twistin' the night away
Man, you oughta see her go
Twistin' to the rock and roll
Here you find the young and old
Twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin', man
Everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin'
They're twistin' the night

One more time

// Sugar Dumpling //

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day, yeah

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day

Now listen while I tell you a story
A story about my girl
Oh I call her sugar dumpling because
She's the sweetest things in this world

Oh and whenever I-I'm feeling bad
Right away she puts me to bed
She hires two nurses, one to hold my hand
The other one to rub my head
Let 'em rub it, but

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day

Now whenever I'm hungry
I tell her fix me something to eat
And oh, she rushes in the kitchen and fixes me a dinner
With seven different kinds of meat
And oh, whenever I call at two in the morning
And say, come on over if you can
Before I hang up the telephone, ahe's sitting beside me
With a cup of coffee in her hand
Gimme that coffee 'cause

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day

Sugar dumpling, oh yeah...

// Nothing Can Change This Love //

If I go, a million miles away
I'd write a letter, each and everyday
'Cause honey nothing, nothing can ever change this love I have for you

Mmmmmm, make me weep
And you can make me cry
See me coming
And you can pass me by
But honey, nothing, nothing can ever change this love I have for you

Wo-oh-oh, you're the apple of my eye, you're cherry pie
And oh you're, you're cake and ice cream
Oh you're sugar and spice, and everything nice
You're the girl of my, my, my, my, dreams

But if you wanted, to leave me and roam
When you got back, I'd just say welcome home
'Cause honey nothing, nothing, nothing can ever change this, love I have, for you
Wo-oh-oh-oh...

[Musical Interlude]

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know that nothing, nothing, nothing can ever 
Change the love I have for you.

// Little Red Rooster //

I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard,
Upset in every way

Dogs begin to bark now,
And the hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark now,
And the hounds begin to howl
Watch out stray cat,
The little red rooster's on the prowl

If you see the little red rooster
Won't you please drive him home
If you see the little red rooster
Won't you please drive him home
Been no peace in the barnyard
Since that little red rooster's been gone

I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard,
Upset in every way

// Tennessee Waltz //

I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I untroduced him to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Only you know how much I have lost 
Yes I lost my little darling the night they were playing
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz

// Touch The Hem Of His Garment //

Oh, there was a woman in the Bible days,
she had been sick, sick so very long
but she heard about Jesus was passing by,
so she joined the gathering throng
and while she was pushing her way through,
someone ask her: 'What are you trying to do?'

She said:
'if I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'll be made whole'

She cried:
'Oh Lord, Oh Lord and Oh Lord, Oh Lord'
Said :
'if I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'll be made whole'

Oh, She spent her money here and there
until she had no, had no more to spare,
the doctors, they'd done all they could
but their medicine would do no good.
When she touched Him The Saviour didn't see
but still He turned around and cried
'Somebody touched me'

She said:
'It was I who just wanna touch the hem of Your garment,
I know I'll be made whole right now'

She stood there crying:
'Oh Lord, Oh Lord and Oh Lord, Oh Lord'

Said:
'If I could just touch the hem of His garment,
I know I'll made whole right now'

// Lovable //

She's so lovable

// Only Sixteen //

She was only sixteen, only sixteen 
But I loved her so 
She was too young to fall in love 
And I was too young to know 

We'd laugh and we'd sing 
And do the little things 
That made my heart glow 
But she was too young to fall in love 
And I was too young to know 

Why did I give my heart so fast 
It never will happen again 
But I was a mere lad of sixteen 
I've aged a year since then 

She was only sixteen, only sixteen 
With eyes that would glow 
But she was too young to fall in love 
And I was too young to know 

(But why did you give your heart so fast?) 
Boy, it never will happen again 
(But you were a mere lad of sixteen) 
I've aged a year since then 

She was only sixteen, only sixteen 
With eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love 
And I was too young to know 
She was too young to fall in love 
And I was too young to know

If some miracle could win your love for me

Wooah ooo little girl

// Another Saturday Night //

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause i just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

I got in town a month ago, I seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em but as yet I haven't met 'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in 

Here another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

Another fella told me he had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
to a cat named Frankenstein 

Here's another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful way

(Here it is another weekend and I ain't got nobody
Man if I was back home I'd be swinging
Two chicks on my arm
Aww yeah
Listen to me huh)

It's hard on a fella, when he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town

Here it's another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful way

// That's Where It's At //

Lights turned way down low
& music soft & slow
With someone you love so
That's where it's at, yeah

Your world turned upside down
You're making not a sound
No one else around
That's where it's at, yeah

Let me tell you
Your heart beatin' fast
You're knowin' that time will pass
But a-hopin' that it lasts
That's where it's at, oh yeah

That's where it's at, pretty baby
That's where it's at, oh yes it is
That's where it's at, pretty baby
That's where it's at, oh yeah

Let me tell you just one thing
To say it's time to go
& she says "Yes I know"
But just stay one minute more
That's where it's at

Oh let me say it one more time
That's where it's at, pretty baby
That's where it's at, I know that's where it's at
That's where it's at, pretty baby
That's where it's at

// A Change Is Gonna Come //

I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh, and just like the river I've been running ever since

It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gon' come, oh yes, it will

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky

It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gon' come, oh yes, it will

I go to the movie and I go downtown
Somebody keep telling me don't hang around

It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gon' come, oh yes, it will

Then I go to my brother
And I say, "Brother, help me please"
But he winds up knockin' me
Back down on my knees

There've been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on

It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gon' come, oh yes, it will

// Jesus Gave Me Water //

Woah, Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water, I wanna let His praises swell
Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water and it was not in the well

Well, there was a woman from Samaria, came to the well to get some water
There she met a stranger who did a story tell
Then the woman dropped her pitcher
She's drinking was made richer
From the water He gave her and it was not in the well

Yes, He gave her water, Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water, I wanna let His praises swell
Jesus gave her water, He gave that woman water
Gave her living, loving, lasting water and it was not in the well

Well, on that woman He had pity, she ran back to the city
Crying glory Hallelujah and did His wonders tell
She left my Savior singing, she came back to Him bringing
The times she'd had water Lord, and it was not in the well

Yes, He gave her water, Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water, I wanna let His praises swell
Jesus gave that woman water, gave her that love and lasting water
Water and it was not in the well

Well, Lord that woman left a shoutin' and there was no room for doubtin'
That she had met a Savior who did all wonders tell
Every time she doubtin' she start to think about Him
The man that gave her that water Lord, and it was not in the well

Yes, He gave her water, Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water, I wanna let His praises swell
Tell you He gave that woman water, gave her that love and lasting water
Water, water, water, water loving water and it was not in the well
