// The Rover //

I've been to London, seen seven wonders
I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for

There can be no denying
That the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flying
There's a new plague on the land

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands

Traversed the planet, when heaven sent me
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight
I hear the rested rivers call

And the wind is crying
From a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying
On the dark side of the globe

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You got me rocking when I ought to be a-rolling
Darling, tell me, darling, which way to go
You keep me rocking, baby, then you keep me stalling
Won't you tell me, darling, which way to go, that's right

Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry
And I would dearly like to know
Of all this wonder, of earthly plunder
Will it leave us anything to show?

And our time is flying
See the candle burning low
Is the new world rising
From the shambles of the old?

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just, if we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just join hands
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah
Ah, ah, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right

// In My Time Of Dying //

In my time of dying
I want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do
Is take my body home

Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus got to make up
You know
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed

Meet me, Jesus, meet me
Ooh, meet me in the middle of the air
If my wings should fail me, Lord
Oh, please meet me with another pair

Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Oh, oh
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up
Somebody, somebody
Oh, oh
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed

Oh, Saint Peter
At the gates of heaven
Won't you let me in?
I never did no harm
I never did no wrong
Ah, oh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn
Let me blow your horn
Oh, I never did no harm
Did no harm
I've only been this young once
I never thought I'd do anybody no wrong
No, not once, oh no

Oh yeah!

Oh, I did somebody some good
Somebody some good, yes, oh
Oh, did somebody some good, yeah
I must have did somebody some good, yeah
Oh, I believe I did
I see the smiling faces
I know I must have left some traces, oh

And I see them in the streets
And I see them in the field
And I hear them shouting under my feet
And I know it's got to be real
Oh Lord, deliver me
All the wrong I've done
Oh, you can deliver me, Lord
I only wanted to have some fun
Oh, hear the angels marching, hear them marching
Hear them marching, hear them marching, the marching

Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, ah, oh
Now my Jesus, hey, yeah, it's got to be my Jesus, oh
It's got to be, it's got to be my Jesus, it's got to be, oh
It's got to be my Jesus, oh, take me home
Come on, come on, I can hear the angels singing
Oh, here they come, here they come, here they come
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Oh, it feels pretty good up here, pretty good up here
Oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Ooh I'll see you again, come on
[?], ooh yes
Oh, don't you make it my dying, dying, dying

(Coughing)
Cough
That's gonna be the one isn't it?
Come have a listen then
Oh yes, thank you

// Houses Of The Holy //

Let me take you to the movie
Can I take you to the show?
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan's daughter
And it only goes to show
And you know

There's an angel on my shoulder
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I'll sow
You know

So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you stall?
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the master's call?

Satan and man

Said there ain't no use in crying
'Cause it will only, only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying?
Was this the only world you had? Oh, oh

So let me take you, take you to the movie
Can I take you, baby, to the show?
Why don't you let me be yours ever truly?
Can I make your garden grow?
You know that's right

// Trampled Under Foot //

Greasy slicked down
Groovy leather trim
I like the way you hold the road

Guaranteed to run for hours

// Kashmir //

Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Ooh, baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, ooh, yeah I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying

Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When moving through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Ooh

Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Oh come on, oh, let me take you there... let me take you there
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, let me take you there... let me take you there

// In The Light //

And if you feel that you can't go on
And your will's sinking low
Just believe, and you can't go wrong
In the light, you will find the road
You will find the road

Hey, ooh, did you ever believe that I could leave you
Standing out in the cold?
Yeah, baby, I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through
To the very depths of my soul, yeah
Oh-ho, baby, I just want to show you what a clear view
It is from every bend in the road
Now listen to me
Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was
And really would be for you, too, honey
As you would for me, oh, I would share your load
Let me share your load
Ooh, let me share, share your load

And if you feel that you can't go on
In the light, you will find the road
Hey, oh ho, the the winds of change may blow around you
But that will always be so
Whoa whoa, when love is pain it can devour you, but you are never alone
I will share your load, I will share your load
Baby, let me, oh, let me

In the light
Everybody needs the light
Ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh, baby
In the light, in the light, in the light
[?]

Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh, yeah
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh yeah yeah
Light, light, light, in the light, everybody, come on now

// Down By The Seaside //

Down by the seaside
See the boats go sailing
Can the people hear
Oh, what the little fish are saying?

Oh ooh
The people turned away, oh
The people turned away

Down in the city streets
See all the folk go racing, racing
No time left, oh no
To pass the time of day

Hey, hey, yeah
The people turned away
The people turned away
So far away, so far away

See how they run, see how they run
See how they run, see how they run
Do you still do the twist?
Do you find you remember things that well?
I wanna tell you
Some go twisting every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, oh

Out in the country
Hear the people singing
Singing about their growing
Knowing where they're going
Yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, the people turned away, yeah
Oh, the people turned away

Sing loud for the sunshine
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for Lady Nature
And she will come back again
Yeah, yes, she will

Oh, the people turned away
The people turned away

// Ten Years Gone //

Then, as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Flying skies of fortune, each a separate way
On the wings of maybe, downing birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to go
But as the eagle leaves the nest, got so far to go

Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be

Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad?
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had?
Do you ever remember me, baby?
Did it feel so good?
Cause it was just the first time
And you knew you would

Through the eyes and I sparkle, senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul

Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be
Oh darling, oh darling
Oh, oh darling, oh yeah, oh darling

I'm never going to leave you
I'm never going to leave
Holding on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holding on, ten years gone
I'm never, I'm never
Ooh, yeah

// Night Flight //

I received a message from my brother across the water
He sat laughing as he wrote, "The end's in sight"
So I said goodbye to all my friends
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox
Because I know it's time to fly

Oh, yeah, come on, meet me in the morning
Meet me in the middle of the night
Ah, yeah, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright?
Ooh yeah, ah hah

I just jumped a train that never stops
So now somehow I know I'll never finish paying for my ride
Someone pushed a gun into my hand
Tell me I'm the type of man
To fight the fight without inquiring

Oh, yeah-ha come on, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night, yeah?
Oh, well, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright?

Oh, mama, well, I think it's time I'm leaving
Nothing here to make me stay
Whoa, mama, well, it must be time I'm going
They're knocking down them doors
They're trying to take me away
Please, Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell
And ring it loud and clear?
Please, Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell?
Tell the people they got to fly away from here

Oh, I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile
We are in the middle of a change in destination
When the train stops, all together we will smile

Oh, come on, come on now, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, n-n-night?
Oh, oh yeah, everybody know the morning time is coming
Don't it make you wanna feel alright? Ah, ah, yeah
Make me feel alright
Fly now, baby
Get to fly, yeah
Fly now, baby
Ooh, hey hey
Uh, uh, uh, uh

// The Wanton Song //

Silent woman in the night, you came
Took my seed from my shaking frame
Same old fire, another flame
And the wheel rolls on

Silent woman through the flames, you come
From the deep behind the sun
Seems my nightmares, my loving gun
Left me barely holding on, oh

With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand
When we know the time has come
Lose my senses, lose command
Feel your healing rivers run

Is it every time I fall
That I think this is the one?
Ooh, in the darkness can you hear me call?
Another day has just begun
Another day, yeah

Silent woman, my face is changed
Some know in ways to come
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame
And the wheel rolls on, rolls on
Rolls on, rolls on, babe, ooh

// Boogie With Stu //

Been in town, my baby, we just got to rock on
Yeah, darling, we just got to go home
I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on, baby, just rock, rock, rock

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, honey
We've been shaking all night
Oh, darling, we just got to roll right
Aah, ooh, my head, rock on, rock on

Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe

I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on baby, just rock, rock, rock
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo ooh hoo ooh hoo ooh hoo ooh hoo
Let's go out
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo

I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on baby, just rock, rock, yeah

// Black Country Woman //

"Shall we roll it, Jimmy?"
("We're rolling on, what, one?")
("No, one again?")
("Got to get this airplane off.")
("Naw, leave it, yeah.")

Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to tell me that you love me so
You didn't have to love me, mama, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to make me a total disgrace
You didn't have to leave me with that beer in my face
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
That's alright, it's awful dog-gone clear

Hey, hey, baby, why you treat me mean?
Oh, oh, baby, why you treat me mean?
You didn't have to crucify me like you did
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid
Hey, hey, mama, why'd you treat me mean?
You didn't have say you'd always be by my side
You didn't have to tell me you'd be my blushing bride
Hey, hey, mama, why you treat me mean?
But that's alright, I know your sisters, too

You didn't have to tell me that you love me so
You didn't have to leave me, mama, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
You didn't have to leave me like a total disgrace
You didn't have to leave me with that beer on my face
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
Oh, but that's alright, I'd be the same way, too

Now now now, you didn't have to crucify me like you did
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to tell me you would be my own
You didn't have to tell me, baby, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
That's alright, I know your sister, too

What's the matter with you, mama?

// Sick Again //

From the window of your rented limousine
I caught your pretty blue eyes
One day soon you're gonna reach sixteen
Painted lady in the city of lies

Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, babe
I must be the one you need, yeah

Clutching pages from your teenage dream
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise
Through the circus of the L.A. queens
How fast you learn the downhill slide

Oh, how you like my face?
Still don't know your name
You know I'm the one you want, babe, ooh yes
I must be the one you need, yeah

Oh, you got me feeling
Just a bit, just a bit

Lips like cherries and the brow of a queen
Come on, flash it, flash it in my eyes
Said you dug me since you were thirteen
Then you giggle as you heave and sigh

Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
Baby, I gotta tell you, I'm the one you want
And everybody know I'm the one you need, yeah

Oh, give it to me, come on now
Come on now
Come on now

Hours, hours, and the moments in between
Oh, baby, I couldn't count the times
The fun of coming, oh, the pain in leaving
Baby, dry those silver eyes

Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, ooh yes
I'm the one you need, yeah

Ooh, that's right
Ooh, yeah, that's right
Ooh, that's right
That's right
That's right
Ooh yeah, that's right
That's right
