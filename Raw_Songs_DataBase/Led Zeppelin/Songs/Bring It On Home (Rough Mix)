All you pretty women
Sitting out all night long
I gotta tell you baby
You gonna seduce me all night long

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home

Keep on messing me, baby
Keep messing me around
You come home with the morning sun
Boogie all night long

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Ooh, bring it on home
Alright!

I don't care sweet baby
What your money's saying
I'm gonna give you sweet loving cry
You're gonna boogie night and day

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home

Bring it on home
Home, home, home
Home, home, ooh yeah
You got it, you got it
