Oh, nobody's fault but mine
Nobody's fault but mine
Trying to save my soul tonight

Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

Devil. He taught me to roll
Devil. He taught me to roll
How to roll the lot you like

Nobody's fault but mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Brother. He showed me the gong
Brother. He showed me the ding dong ding dong
How to kick that gong to light

Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

Got a monkey on my back
M-m-m-m-monkey on my back, back, back, back
Gonna change my ways tonight

Nobody's fault but mine

How to kick that gong to light
N-n-n-n-n-no, nobody's fault
