There was a time, I used to call you on my very own
We were so happy woman, talking for hours and hours on the telephone

Then one day, I set you up to walk right outta my life
Leaving me all by myself, all alone, to cry every night

(Babe ooh, I want you to come back home yeah (come on home)
(Ooh yeah) Sweet little girl (ooh yeah, been gone so long)
Been away so long

Now listen to me: I said I made up my mind
Woman when you left me there, oh
I was gonna find another sweet lover
Who's gonna feel all of my cares

So I met a sweet little girl, just about as nice as she could be, oh
I fell in love with that woman, but she turned around
And did the same thing again to me

(Babe Baby, please come home (come on home) home yeah
I know, (you been gone too long) been away so long
(Babe I want you to please come home, oh (come on home)

So I made up my mind, I gonna crawl right back to you woman
I'm gonna plead and plead and plead, yeah, 'til you're here by my side
I can't even walk down the same old streets we used to walk down
'Cause I keep thinking about all the good times
Keep thinking about it, I wanna make you mine

Babe, babe, babe, please (come on home, yeah come on home)
(You've been gone too long)
