And if I say to you tomorrow
"Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be."

Catch the wind
See us spin
Sail away
Leave today
Way up high in the sky

But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By taking our time

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be

Catch the wind
See us spin
Sail away
Leave today
Way up high
In the sky

But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By taking our time

So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, the answer lies with you

Catch the wind
See us spin
Sail away
Leave today
Way up high
In the sky

But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By taking our time

Oh the wind won't blow
And we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show

Catch the wind
We're gonna see it spin
We're gonna sail
Leave today
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh. My my my my my my yeah

Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never going to know that I move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh Lord
Baby baby babe. Huh? Oh I love ya
Do no no no no no no. C'mon now
I want you now
