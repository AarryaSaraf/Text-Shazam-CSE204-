I'll ascend
As the sun into the night
I'll appear
On a pale horse alight
Skyward, I climb alone
Yet, bound forever to this Earth
Quench my unholy thirst
To will is to dissent

I'll ascend
As the sun into the night
I'll appear
On a pale horse alight

Go forth
And conquer
In thy own name
For thy own flesh
Forsake shame
Forsake guilt
Do what thou wilt

Onwards, driven by doubt
Carving my beastly ways
Never will I submit
To will is to disobey
Hail empower thyself
Strive forever to more
And make heel the universe
So the last will be the first

Onwards, driven yet calm
Carving malevolent ways
Never will I submit
To will is to disobey

Go forth
And conquer
In thy own name
For thy own flesh
Forsake shame
Forsake guilt
Do what thou wilt

Go forth
And conquer
Forsake shame
Forsake thy fucking guilt

For love is the law
Love under will
