As far as trying to go up against the goverment, well, unless the whole country did it, I guess

Now you listen to me
Just enough water
For one third of the world
Oil baron running the government
So I'll start a war

All votes invalid
Use any old lie
Gonna carve up your wealth
Like pumpkin pie

Only fools won't realize it
Won't be told that empires run on the old black gold

It's a global abrasion
It's conflagration
United nations
It's a total invasion

Terrify them
Complete submission
This our goal
This our mission
Destroy your customs
You'll have no say
We'll clothe your women
The western way

It's a fucking crusade
A lesson in trade
So all you intellectuals
Were gonna invade

It's a global abrasion
It's conflagration
United nations
It's a total invasion

Mexico city
24 Million people
Half a litre a day
Is their ration

The final push
The last battle
Eden restored
Man is cattle
We want your oil
We want your land
We'll take your wealth
You'll have much less
Well change your God
To the bitch goddess

It's a global abrasion
It's conflagration
United nations
It's a total invasion

It's a global abrasion
It's conflagration
United nations
It's a total invasion
