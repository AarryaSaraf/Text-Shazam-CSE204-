"Let them hate me, so that they will but fear me." 

"Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them
Bring them here and kill them in front of me"


Behold! As Rome burns so do I...
'tis not the last empire to crumble
I bore witness to rise and fall ov tribes ov Adonai
And fallen short ov a glory ov god

Lord ov hosts
Whore ov salvation
Tear the skies as you spread your legs
Vomit forth upon my head
All afflictions and abominations known to man
