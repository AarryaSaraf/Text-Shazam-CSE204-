the son ov morn
what made me so divine?
I, transcending ecstasy through ecstasy
I who am eternally defined by my Will



behold I am the spawn ov downcast Ariman
awakened, yet am no longer human
kindle me to Thy rapture
as I descend into Sheol

Hiva! hear my call!
transform my flesh into flame
Hiya! hear my cry!
sustain my being in million-fold forms



our creed: the living flesh
our law: trespass all the laws
since NUIT is our refuge
and HADIT becomes our light



all stirs within
tis chaos in and above me
in the world ov nether-nether
"I" infinite space is all-consuming

behold! I am unending!
the consciousness ov "I" shines universally
unbound by wretched dogma
I spew my will forth!
hell is democracy!



all things exist in me
I believe in naught save myself
my sermon steadfast and proud:
there is nothing but god in me!

all things stir in me
with joy and suffering
my sermon steadfast and proud:
there is nothing but god in me!
