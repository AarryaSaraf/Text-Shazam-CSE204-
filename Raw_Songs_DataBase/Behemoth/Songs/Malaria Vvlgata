Let all bibles preach the sermon ov vengeance
Let the hallowed verses call for war
Behold as seraphs fall from ebonising skies
Let's stab the world and halt the cosmic lie

Spare no one
Show them no pity
Tooth for a tooth
Eye for an eye
Hostibvs hvmani natvrae
Begone, all ye fucking cowards

Myself, I am a foe to all your piety
Anointed by the radiance ov warring Mars
Submerged, I am into oceans ov enmity
I'll find no peace in here until I ram the luminous stars

Spare no one
Show them no pity
Tooth for a tooth
Eye for an eye
Hostibvs hvmani natvris
Annihilate the crux ov the untruth

O death
Thou art so quiet that it hurts
Pale, proud and so immaculate
Beyond all contemplation
Beyond perception
Come forth
Eradicate

We shall trample all over thee
Spreading exhortations mightier than the sword
Each word revolts against god-fearing helotry
Restoring the hegemony ov primordial law
