Am I ov God or Satan, or an obsidian hemisphere?
Am I the fated sovereign or sanctitude inverse?
Consider the great solitude ov the truly liberated man
Set forth to raze frail humanity once again

Am I to act alone?
If so, I'll draw blood from stone
Am I to act alone?
If so, I'll be the thundering tremor to whip the storm

Why are we such tender flesh under blackening skies?
Are we defenceless prey in a predator's eye?
Can we stay stalwart in the face ov fated tragedy?
Are we to remain subjugated by fictitious morality?

Am I to act alone?
If so, I'll separate the meat from bone
Am I to act alone?
If so, I shall be the herald ov reckoning's swarm

Host ov the ones condemned
Dethrone god malevolent
Hear the cannons roar
We are off to war
Uncrown he with reins adorned
Blacken the icon
We for whom no god shall mourn
Off to war

Am I ov God or Satan, or an obsidian hemisphere?
Am I the fated sovereign or sanctitude inverse?
Consider the great solitude ov the truly liberated man
Set forth to raze frail humanity once again
