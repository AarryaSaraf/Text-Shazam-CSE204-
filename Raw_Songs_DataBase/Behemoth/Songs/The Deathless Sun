I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the deathless sun

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the deathless sun

My god is the all-devouring pyre
My goddess dwells in Hadean somber tides
Burst forth from the crushing depths as Leviathan
And then descend into the bowels of the Earth
The imperial throne is set to dominate
The powers of ruthless zephyr forever shall reign

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Divinvs, the deathless sun

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Divinvs, the deathless sun

My god is the all-consuming fire
Fated centre of the bottomless pit
He's the void beyond any cipher
Starless night, immortally lit
When the throne of the carnal world is restrained
The powers of ruthless zephyr forever shall reign

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the undying sun

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the undying sun

Let's drink to he of the shining morn
To the lacerated yet so divine
To the sun that evermore shall rise
To my ascent, to thy demise

I am nothing
But without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the undying sun

I am nothing
But without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the deathless sun
