Can you withstand the rapid currents ov the river Rubicon?
Can you feel the pulse ov ecclesial litanies?
Can you bring the enemy who can match my wrath?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Earth?

Can you feel the heartbeat down in the belly ov the Leviathan?
Can you see the loving God in the dying flesh ov his most beloved son?
Can you taste the gangrenous fruit from the forbidden tree?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Sea?

Rex Infernus
Antichrist
Born ov the shadows
Warring Mars

Can you smell the genesis ov victory when the sacrum's raped?
Can you hear Chaldean prayers chanting ov my name?
Can you curse all those who say: conquered is life?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Air!

Can you taste the blood ov Abel on the sacrificial knife?
Can you convey the souls out from the bosom ov Abraham?
Can you confront the speculum ov thy soul with the fearless eye?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Fire!

Find divity in harlot's lechery
Seek monogamy in lustful flames
I, once married to the Peccatrix Divine
I find redemption in the Faustian light
