O Mighty Watcher!
Thou art all and all art in Thee
free me from mortals
intoxicate with Thy self love
O Mighty Sentinel!
Thou art the concious one
break the monotony ov existence
that I may illuminate!

uncrowned in Tarterean Sulphur
elder than the Memphian kings
Thy reign so timeless and infinite
ever silent watchers, whom mankind yet aches to embrace
grand me Thy Promethean rays
blacker than light...
cunquering lion-headed god
by the name ov Legion dost Thou arrive



Thou hast seen the prophets in the desert
Thou hast bled for the fallen idols from beyond
prevailing stregth hath made Thee greater
than the god...
from amongst the million dead angels army
Azazel, begotten not ov human race
honour the divinity vision ov victorious sun
open wide your glimmering eyes
bathe in divinity ov loneliness
empowered in self creation
shine inward!
Shemyaza! the profoundest one
spread Thy wings
the desolate one
Thy disease untamed within the sinister self...

O Mighty Watcher!
Thou art all and all art in Thee
free me from mortals
intoxicate with Thy self love
O Mighty Sentinel!
Thou art the concious one
break the monotony ov existence
that I may illuminate!







beyond all cowardness!
hast Thou no fear?
spit out the blasphemy!
strive unto sin...

seduce Thyself
o mighty seer!
the ancient voyager
blind me with light

the sleepless ones
in aimless andering
Thou must first fall
to reign in blasphemy...
