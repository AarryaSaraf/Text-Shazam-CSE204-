// Wolves ov Siberia //

Enthrone thyself, O Archuman
O how thou shineth in the realm above
As planets rumble when thou descended upon this globe
To walk this Earth like a shimmering god

Let it be forever heard
We lost our Eden to own the world
Let it be forever know
We lost our battle to win the war

Come all ye, Wolves ov Siberia
We hail the flame, we hail the ice
Beyond bosom, beyond materia
We reject! We fucking deny!

Let it be forever heard
From Slave to king, from king to man
Let it be eternally know
We fled from heavens to rape the world

// God = Dog //

There's serpent coiling around my neck
The adoring crescent moon in blazing night
The holy river Ganga flowing through my muddled hair
In the ancient times before I learned ov who I am

If I am a missing link between the pig and the divine
I shall cast the pearls before the swine

I am no good shepherd on an ox
But a solitude ov the loneliest star
Like a 1000 shrines subsumed into the void
Like a dead space in between the suns

Is a God to live in a dog? No!
But the highest are of us
Is a God to live in a dog? No!
But the highest are of us

Elohim ([children:] Elohim!)
I shall not forgive!
Adonai ([children:] Adonai!)
I shall not forgive!
Living God ([children:] Living God!)
I shall not the forgive!
Jesus Christ ([children:] Jesus Christ!)
I forgive thee not!

// Ecclesia Diabolica Catholica //

Eritis sicut dii
Thus sermonized the serpent ov Eden
Thus struck the breath ov the Earth
And thus flooded the blood ov the soil
Slither into the gaping void!

I worship Thee, O vicious man!
Now mark my words ye mortal race
Feed my wrath with lion's gore
Feed my envy with the fat ov lambs
As the wicked ways will flourish
Behold the monuments ov God decay

Lex Divinus, I stamp to dust
I despoil the holy books
I desecrate the angelic verses
Like dead leaves wither they to ash
As I am leading the hosts ov stars
Onwards, embrace the Sur

In absentia Dei we sermonize
In ecclesia Satani
Thy might is right!

I have watched the birth ov planets
I have witnessed the death ov worlds
I've conducted the choir ov stars
I have ridden the tail ov the comet
As I've transformed
From God to ash
From dust to Man

In absentia Dei we evangelize
In absentia Christi
We spread like swarming plagues
In ecclesia Satani
Thy might is right!

// Bartzabel //

O Purple flame!
O whirling wheel ov life!
Appear! Move! Rise!

Come unto me Bartzabel
By the laws divine I quell
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the raging blood cells
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the spear, the sword, the spell
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the word that openeth Hell!

By Ra Hoor Khuit!
By Elohim!
By Samael!
By Seraphim!
By Hoor and Khem!
By Gods ov War!
Ares and Mars, and mighty Thor!

Come unto me Bartzabel
By the power ov the panther's spell
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the circling citadel
Come unto me Bartzabel
By this mind ov miracles
Come unto me Bartzabel
By the moon and stars, I swear!

By Ra Hoor Khuit!
By Elohim!
By Samael!
By Seraphim!
By Hoor and Khem!
By Gods ov War!
Ares and Mars, and mighty Thor!

By Gods ov War!
By Khem and Hoor!
By Hachiman!
Mentu, and all
And by thy master, Graphiel
Come unto me
O Bartzabel!

// If Crucifixion Was Not Enough... //

Crawl with insects and feed on barren soil!
O! rise above the animal in you!
Find kindness among the unkind!
Slowness ov decrepitude
Like sirens beckoning me to their ruined shores!
Impotent in the eye ov the storm!
Cthonic ore forefathers!
Ravishing sires ov the black hosts!

Feast on their bones!
Feed on their flesh!
Ares!
Adonis!
Astarte!
Prometheus' Rebirth!

In constellations with dust!
And thus thou empowered me!
I am legion in company ov seraphs!
At the threshold ov this godless anarchy!
Malediction to all that is Angelic!
Pariah ov collapsing truth!
Crucifixion was not enough!
The alpha ov this mortal whorl!

Feed on their bones!
Feed on their flesh!
Ares!
Adonis!
Astarte!
Asmodias' Rebirth!

// Angelvs XIII //

Begone!

Ye prophets ov Eucharist 
My praise shall climb to your decline 
May rust corrode on Michael's sword 
Recession ov the progeny divine 

Come forth ye!
Preachers ov imminent death 
Let loose the mighty beasts upon 
Damnatio Ad Bestiam!
Bring an end to this decrepit world 

Countless my legions 
Many my names 
A thousand descendants 
A goat ov Mendez 

Come forth ye!
Heralds ov ruir 
And mute to dust their anaemic way's 
Futile relic ov an utopian age 
King ov kings recrucified 
What an ignominious end!

El Shaddai 
Woe unto Thee O Galilean God Be Thou ashamed YHWH!
Woe unto Thee To aeons I curse!

Countless my legions 
Many my names 
A thousand young 
A goat ov Mendez 

For I am my Christ over myself 
The accused became the accuser 
For I am Satan incarnate 
Serpent ov old immaculate!

// Sabbath Mater //

I am she who spits out the lusts
The root ov sin derived from me
I am born ov sacrilegious uterus
Magna peccatrix
I am she who cast the adversaries out
I am the spawn ov her vulva obsolete
Libera nos blasfemia madonna
Magna hecate

With the sound ov trumpets!
With the pounding ov demon drums!
Come forth within!
Come forth without!

With the roaring thunders
With the blinding light
Come to be exalted!
Come to be despised!

For i am Aurora's son
With no beginnin, with no decline
Sabbath ,atter dolorosa
A progency ov her lecherous cunt
Love me orgasmically
Fuck me estatically
Genetrix meretix
I pledge my heart to thee
I bow down devotedly

With the sound ov trumpets!
With the pounding ov demon drums!
Come forth within!
Come forth without!

With the roaring thunders
With the blinding light
Come to be honoured
And to be despised!

Blessed be the destroyer
For she's the creator!

// Havohej Pantocrator //

Our father, who art in hell 
Unhallowed be Thy name 
Thy legions come 
Thy enemies begone 
On Earth as it is in the Netherworld 
Embrace our souls untraveled 
Let us sail to the farthest sea 
Ignite our craving hearts 
Illuminate our ageless will 

Dissolve!
Coagulate!

Our father, who lies in wait 
Unhallowed be Thy name 
Thy kingdom enshrines 
Thy phosphor blinds 
On Earth as it is in Hell 
Embrace my soul untraveled 
Let me sail to the farthest sea 
When I am Thou, O Lord 
And Lord when Thou art Me 

Dissolve!
Coagulate!

By thou holy name: Satan
At his command 
Heaven shall burn!
By thou holy name: Lucifer 
At his command 
Heaven shall blaze!
By thou holy name: Leviathan 
At his command 
Heaven shall burn!
By thou holy name: Belial 
At his command 
Heaven shall burn!

// Rom 5:8 //

Morning Star 
Phosporos 
How Thou shinest in the fiery 
Empyrean above 
Paracletus 
How do I rejoice, for Thy apostles flock around 

For Thou art Christ a rebours!
L'enfer abides deep within 
Limbo is stirring up Thy cells 
Below Sheol, where odium dwells 
Reverse Davidian psalm 
The jaws ov Hades set ajar 

Let the cold moon 
lick the blood from my stigmatas 
Let the burning sun 
devour gore from my wounds 

For I am Christ a rebours!
L'enfer abides deep within 
Limbo is stirring up in my cells 
Deep down below my odium dwells 
Reverse Davidian psalm 
The jaws ov Pandemonium set ajar

"I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore."
"I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore."

// We Are The Next 1000 Years //

Oh sun and moon beheld!
When we rose up from dust 
No sound or song would dare dispraise 
The might we have become 

We hail to Thee, O avenging force!
We are the dawn ov New Jerusalem 
We are the ending ov all days 
We are the next 1000 years!

To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the Emperor ov Rome!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the devil in our souls!

We go where no mortals dare to go 
Explore that human flesh yet not explored 
The tree ov god shall not withstand the ruthless storm 
We are the death that rides the pale horse 

We hail to Thee, O avenging force!
We are the deportees from the Promised Land 
Fallen, but we rewrite the history with blood 
We are the next 1000 years!

To Christ, falls saviour on the cross!
To the Emperor ov Rome!
To Christ, falls saviour on the cross 
For devil our souls!

// O Pentagram Ignis //

Can you withstand the rapid currents ov the river Rubicon?
Can you feel the pulse ov ecclesial litanies?
Can you bring the enemy who can match my wrath?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Earth?

Can you feel the heartbeat down in the belly ov the Leviathan?
Can you see the loving God in the dying flesh ov his most beloved son?
Can you taste the gangrenous fruit from the forbidden tree?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Sea?

Rex Infernus
Antichrist
Born ov the shadows
Warring Mars

Can you smell the genesis ov victory when the sacrum's raped?
Can you hear Chaldean prayers chanting ov my name?
Can you curse all those who say: conquered is life?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Air!

Can you taste the blood ov Abel on the sacrificial knife?
Can you convey the souls out from the bosom ov Abraham?
Can you confront the speculum ov thy soul with the fearless eye?
So that Man can become the Lord ov the Fire!

Rex Infernus
Antichrist
Born ov the shadows
Warring Mars

Find divity in harlot's lechery
Seek monogamy in lustful flames
I, once married to the Peccatrix Divine
I find redemption in the Faustian light
