Album: AndTheForestsDreamEternally

// Moonspell Rites //

From the dark ancient temples
Horrible palaces
From the land of dark forests
Kingdom of snow and frost
Where true evil dwells
Where flames are spiritual food
Where black satanic holocaust strikes
And people are baptized in blood
I come with the northern winds
I remain true, closed in icy heart

Fire!

Cold, I'm standing in the moonlight
Demons return to me every night
Fill my soul with sacred power
Mystical whispers resound with hallow echo
Spread out my hands
Cold, north majesty rises
Unsilent winds strike this pagan landscape
Where gods sit high on the oaken thrones

Fire!

I'm the dark warrior, presented in flames
Carried on the hellish wings of fire
I discover the deepest desires, feel delight
I destroy all the god's laws
I am almighty, immortal power

// Pure Evil And Hate //

In the night of full moon sacrifice
We are joining with the sign of drums of war
Freezing moon opens the gates of paradise
Our swords are raised up to the skies

Pure evil and hate!
Sodomy and pain!

Where the holy angel's dwell we'll burn it down
We'll turn on hate god's flower of love
Brain of lust we'll spread everywhere
Our pagan brothers will sodomize Christ's flesh

Pure evil and hate!
Sodomy and pain!
