The best things in life are free
But you can't give them to the birds and bees
I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

Your love gives me such a thrill
But your love won't pay my bills
I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
Oh

And money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
I want that money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

I want money
I want lots of money
In fact, I want so much money
Give me that money
Get, get, get, get me money
Get, get, get, get me money
I want that money
