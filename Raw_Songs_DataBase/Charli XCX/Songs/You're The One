Dancing
In the darkness
Pink and lilac
Keep the silence
Crystals
On the skyline
Cut the midnight
Ultraviolet

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

Flying
Through the black night
You're the angel
In the moonlight
Running
Through the thunder
Undercover
Silver lover

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

Yeah, I'm dancing in the darkness
Three years before, I was feeling so heartless
But your burn shined through
Now I'm drinking love potion when I lay next to you
It's a criminal feeling
Happiness cries and my tears are dreaming
My body is screaming
I'm staying right here, no, I'll never be leaving
