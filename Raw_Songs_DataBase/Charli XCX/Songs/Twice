Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it

When it's too much
There's a gun to my head
When it's too much
Got me feeling so scared
Yeah, real talk with my demons lately
Real talk in the mirror, save me
When it's too much
Gotta live life good, appreciate it

Nothing is forever
Lucky to remember
Stay up in the moment
All night, all night, yeah

All the things I love are gonna leave me
One day, you're never gonna be there
I tell myself to take it easy
Don't think twice about it, baby
Up on the hill, we'll see it all end
Die happy thinking 'bout my best friends
Till then I'm diving off the deep end
Don't think twice about it I say

"Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it

Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it"

When I let go
Let my body ascend
Let the love through
See the light at the end
Yeah, real talk with my demons lately
Real talk in the mirror, so brave
When let go
I'll say I lived life good, appreciated

Nothing is forever
Lucky to remember
Stay up in the moment
All night, all night, yeah

All the things I love are gonna leave me
One day, you're never gonna be there
I tell myself to take it easy
Don't think twice about it, baby
Up on the hill, we'll see it all end
Die happy thinking 'bout my best friends
Till then I'm diving off the deep end
Don't think twice about it, I say

"Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it

Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it"

Don't think, don't think twice
Don't think, don't think twice
Don't think, don't think twice
Don't think, don't think twice
