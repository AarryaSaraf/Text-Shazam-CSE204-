Oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no
Ooh, yeah, yeah

I might need a lot, I might need attention
I might wanna fight, I might not let it go
I love you so much, I'm so under pressure
You're choking my neck, you might not let me go

When the lights are out and I feel a little low
That's when your noise is cruelest, when I really catch your bullets
Try to breathe it out 'cause I don't want it to hurt
It makes it harder when my name's on your shirt

But I don't give a fuck what you think about me (Ah)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (Yeah)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me (What?)
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you
I don't give a fuck what you think about me (No)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (Huh)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you
'Cause I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)
I don't give a fuck what you think about me (Yeah)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)

When my blood is falling I can't see the light
I wanna prove a point 'cause it's in my design
We both got some demons to exorcise
Why say you hate me to feel alive? Yeah, yeah

When the lights are out and I feel a little low
That's when your noise is cruelest, when I really catch your bullets
Try to breathe it out, but when I talk, it makes it worse
It makes it harder when my name's on your shirt

But I don't give a fuck what you think about me (Nah)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (No)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)
I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (No)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you
'Cause I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)
I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (No)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)

Haha, haha
What you think about me
Fuck you
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
What you think about me
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Ah
