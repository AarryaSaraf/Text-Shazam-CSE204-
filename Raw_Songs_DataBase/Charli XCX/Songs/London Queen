Ride away from Holloway
I said "Mum, this isn't a holiday
Listen up, I ain't coming back
'Til I can fill the shack up with all gold plaques."
Soon come, home run, whack!
Knock it out the park with a baseball bat

When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK you know

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way, yay yay
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)

Now I live in Hollywood
I can't stop even though I know I should
It feels so good, oh yeah, oh oh
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK you know

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA

Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London queen

Oi, oi, oi (whack)
Oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi (whack)
Oi, oi

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London queen
Living the dream like a London queen
Living the dream like a London queen
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
