All alone on a city high
In New York in the dead of night
We can't swim, we're about to drown
All alone in a famous town

We always knew we never would survive
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

No oxygen left in our hearts
Goin' down and we felt the pain
But we're lookin' cool, sinkin' in the chain
We feel the same as we fall apart

Out here in the blue with the lights behind us
Shot us in our backs but we keep on ridin'
I don't wanna go and the lights are blinding

We always knew we never would survive (Survive)
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

We always knew we never would survive (Survive)
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)
We always knew we never would survive
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)

All alone on a city high
In New York and the dead of night
