They say, "Keep your friends close"
But you're closer, I love when you're here
I'm so far away sometimes, I'm distant, yeah
You might help me, intimacy, I'll admit, I'm scared
Maybe, maybe you can reach me, yeah

Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
You're the only one who knows the way I really feel, oh
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could cut me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

Suddenly, you're in my bedroom under my sheets every night
Suddenly, I lose my fear, it feels good, yeah
I feel guilty, I feel nervous, I feel certain now
Maybe, maybe you can reach me, yeah

Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
You're the only one who knows the way I really feel, oh
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could cut me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

Oh, yeah
Yeah, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

So calm at the surface
I'm scared of nothin'
Underneath, I'm nervous
Can you reach me?
So calm at the surface
Told you I'm scared of nothin'
Underneath, I'm nervous, yeah
Can you reach me?

I think a tough journey to be on
Whilst you're around a lot of people
I feel like I'm learning that about myself
And I don't fully really understand it yet
It hurts here, it like hurts here

Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
You're the only one who knows the way I really feel, oh
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could cut me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

Can you reach me?
Maybe you're my enemy
Can you reach me?
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah
Can you reach me?
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah
Can you reach me?

I seem to think that I'm a really bad person
