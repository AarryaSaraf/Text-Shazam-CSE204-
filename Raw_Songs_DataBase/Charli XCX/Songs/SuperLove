You're whiskey-wasted and beautiful dancing through the fire
You're such a vision to see
I used to think that the power of love was just a song
But now it's got hold of me

S.O.S, is it me, or is this is dangerous?
Kill me with your touch
You're smoking through my blood
R.I.P, set me free, yeah, this is dangerous
I can't get enough

When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

Feels like I'm tripping, I'm falling hard from the highest heights
When I crash, where will you be?
I think your hair looks much better pushed over to one side
How do you feel about me?

S.O.S, this is real, and this is dangerous
You're my favorite drug, I'll smoke you in the club
R.I.P., what a dream, you're so damn dangerous
I can't get enough

When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

When I fall into your super love
'Cause I never seem to get enough
So give me all of your super love
I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you
