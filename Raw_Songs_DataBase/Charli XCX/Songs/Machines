I sit up in my room at night
Hold on to my pillow tight
My dreams are being invaded by somethin' I don't know

I hear these words in my mind
I don't know who put them there but they sure ain't mine
Who's inside everyone's brain?
'Cause recently everybody's been actin' all the same
But now I know

Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

How did they get inside my head?
Makin' me feel so cold and dead
Your thoughts being captured as well
I'm locked in a trance, I'm under the spell
I feel their hands movin' over me
They're squeezing me tight
They're never gonna let me breathe (Breathe)
They take my heart and they rip it up
Change it for a broke watch and now my time is running out
But now I know

Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I can feel the tick tock when I turn my head
I can feel the tick tock when I lie in bed
I can feel the tick tock dancin' in my brain
And I can feel the tick tock runnin' through my veins
But when the tick tock stops yeah, my body erupts
When I close my eyes, I get electric shock
I feel the  in my skin, they're gonna win

I am
I, I
I am, I am a machine
I am
I, I
I am, I am a machine

You're one of me, I'm one of them
Say "Goodbye" to the world, we're never gonna be the same again
But now I know

Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
