Uh, da-da, ooh, your love
Uh, da-da, ooh, your love

Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know
I'll always remember you
And I know, and I know, and I know
I'll always care
Even though, even though, even though
It hurts what you put me through
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Who gets my head so fucked up
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Who makes me scream
Even though, even though, even though
It hurts what you put me through
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, yeah

It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' (Callin')
You say you're sorry, but you're lonely (Lonely)
You know the words that got me fallin'
I got to pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love
One thousand times, the same old story (Story)
I hate myself, I can't control it (-Trol it)
You know the words that got me fallin'
I got to pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love

Uh, da-da, ooh, your love
Uh, da-da, ooh, your love
Uh, da-da, ooh, your love
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love

Let it go, let it go, let it go
My friends keep on tellin' me
Let it go, let it go, let it go
I just don't care
Even though, even though, even though
I know that you're usin' me
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
Feelin' good, feelin' good, feelin' good
It's better than ecstasy
Feelin' good, feelin' good, feelin' good
You take me there
Even though, even though, even though
I know this is bad for me
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, yeah

It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' (Callin')
You say you're sorry, but you're lonely (Lonely)
You know the words that got me fallin'
I got to pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love
One thousand times, the same old story (Story)
I hate myself, I can't control it (-Trol it)
You know the words that got me fallin'
I got to pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love

Uh, da-da, ooh, your love
Uh, da-da, ooh, your love
Uh, da-da, ooh, your love
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love

In the beginning, I thought you were amazin'
And none of my friends could stop me from chasin' you
I was too blind to see through all the flames, babe
But now, I don't wanna care anymore
Yes, all the things she said to me, just a lie
How could I be so dumb?
I don't wanna care anymore (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
You're just pretty, you're not free
I'm so over your vanity
Oh man, I don't wanna care anymore (Oh-oh-oh)
No, no, no, no

It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' (Callin')
Go fuck yourself, don't say you're sorry (Sorry)
I can't believe I used to want this
No more, no
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up (Right to your love, oh-oh)
One thousand times, the same old story (Story)
Forgive myself, now this is over (Over, oh)
I can't believe you had me fallin'
No more, no
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up (Whoa-oh-oh)
Pull up, pull up right to your love

Uh, uh (Your love)
Da-da, ooh, your love
Uh, uh (Your love)
Da-da, ooh, your love
Uh, uh (Your love)
Da-da, ooh, your love
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love
