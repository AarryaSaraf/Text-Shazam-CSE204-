We be in the street
Straight Love Jones bangin'
Throwin' up that love sign
Dope love slangin'
We be in the cut posted up
Flags wavin'
Heart tattoos on my sleeve
Love gangin'

I'm all about that love, love, love
We all about that love, love, love
What you want? Where you from? Throw it up
You ask me what set am I claimin'
I'm claimin' that love gang, bang

Let's catch a shooting star in the sky and ride
And ride (bang)
Put it in your pocket like a rocket and fly
And fly (bang)

Bang, bang, but they can't shoot us down
Love gang and we reppin' through the night
Let's catch a shooting star in the sky and ride
And ride, ride

We be in your house
Make the love boom crazy
Keep it 100 on the dial, speed racin'
Zoom, zoom, zap
3 AM, still ragin'
Heartin' on your grams
'Cause we so love gangin'

I'm all about that love, love, love
We all about that love, love, love
What you want? Where you're from? Throw it up
You ask me what set am I claimin'
I'm claimin' that love gang, bang

Let's catch a shooting star in the sky and ride
And ride (bang)
Put it in your pocket like a rocket and fly
And fly (bang)

(Bang)
(Bang)
(Bang)

We on that bang, bang, bang
We on that shut shit down
Straight up we're love gang bangin'
Love gonna run this town
We on that love, love, love
Our heartbeat bang so tough

You ask me what set am I claimin'
I'm claimin' that love gang (love gang)

Let's catch a shooting star in the sky and ride
And ride (bang)
Put it in your pocket like a rocket and fly
And fly (bang)
