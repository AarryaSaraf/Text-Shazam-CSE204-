(Hey!)
I spend a whole night sippin' on a good time
Can't see the stop sign
What you gonna say?
(Hey!)
Wandering blindly
Please, don't remind me
You're all that I see, what you gonna say?
(Hey!)

All I need is someone livin' for the night ride (night ride)
I can feel it
You've been beaming like a spotlight (spotlight)
(Hey, hey!)

I saw you stop and sta-a-a-are
Why don't you come 'round he-e-e-re?
You glow, oh-oh-oh
Glow, oh-oh
(Hey, hey!)
Why don't you make a mo-o-o-ove?
I see you shining throu-ou-ough
You glow, oh-oh-oh
Glow, oh-oh
(Hey, hey!)

You spend a whole night dancing with the wrong type
Why don't you make right?
Come and hang with me
We could be lightnin'
I know it's frightenin'
Why are you hidin'?
What you wanna say?

All I need is someone livin' for the night ride (night ride)
I can feel it
You've been beaming like a spotlight (spotlight)
(Hey, hey!)

You glow, oh-oh-oh
Glow, oh-oh
(Hey, hey!)

All my midnight sparkling for a ride
Wanna make you mine
You glow, oh-oh-oh

Why don't you make a mo-o-o-ove?
I see you shining throu-ou-ough
You glow, oh-oh-oh
Glow, oh-oh
