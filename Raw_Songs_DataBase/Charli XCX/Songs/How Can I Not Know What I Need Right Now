Oh-oh

I tell good lies when they ask me
But I cried all night in the backseat
No one knows what I feel inside (I used to know what I wanted)
My tears fell down at the party
Like water all on my body
No one knows when I'm really alright

Pulled apart my feelings so raw (Yeah)
Voices shout so loud, can't ignore (Every night, every night, yeah)
I used to think I knew what I wanted
I'm high enough from all the high pressure
I just wanna make myself better

On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, oh

I broke down in Paris (Yeah)
Tried to hide my emotions (Come home)
All flew out my body (Yeah)
But then I cried hard in the hotel
Did that show in London
And I cried still at the party
Doesn't make me happy
How can I not know what I need right now?

Pulled apart my feelings so raw (Yeah, yeah)
Voices shout so loud, can't ignore (Every night, every night, yeah)
I used to think I knew what I wanted (I used to know what I wanted)
But I don't wanna feel the high pressure
I just wanna make myself better

On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, on

Feel so high in the trolley
Feel so high in the trolley
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, someday, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, someday, yeah, yeah
Someday, oh
