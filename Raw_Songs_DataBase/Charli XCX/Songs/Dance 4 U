If you were gonna sing something to a girl to try and seduce her, what would you sing, and will you sing it for us?
Seduce her?!
Yup!
Uhh, I don't know, um... I've never tried to seduce a girl yet

Under your magic
Under your magic in the night
I twist and turn
But I can never put up a fight
You are like diamonds
You are like diamonds in the night
Ask me a question
You know I'll do anything, I'm hittin' the tides (dance)

Just stay
Just stay awake
Just lay
Just lay for me

You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance but you like what I do
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but I'll dance for you

Body electric
Lost in our hyper fantasy
I really feel it
I'm moving both my arms, yeah, it's happening
Lost all my feelings
I don't really care who's watchin' me
We're on a level
If they don't like what we do, well, they can just leave

You stay
You stay awake
You lay
You lay for me

You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance but you like what I do
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but I'll dance for you

Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber)
Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber)
Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber)
Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber), just in place
