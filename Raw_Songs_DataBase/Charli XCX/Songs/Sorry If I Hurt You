I'm sorry if I-, I'm sorry if I-

I talked to you the way I talk to myself
I started taking you for granted and that's not right
Stop saying "thank you" when I needed your help
But still I'm taking you for granted and that's not right

I never really listen
But when you're gone a part of me is missing
I know it's complicated, we both feel the distance
I really hope that you'll forgive me one day

I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I only make it worse
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it hurts

Floatin' in an atmosphere
Hiding from the truth in fear
Slowly we both disappeared
Now it seems so crystal clear
So in denial, oh, yeah

You never really listen
And when I'm gone a part of you is missing
I know it's complicated letting go of feelings
I really hope that you'll forgive me one day

I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I only make it worse
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it hurts, oh

Ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah
I'm sorry if I-, I'm sorry if I-
Oh
