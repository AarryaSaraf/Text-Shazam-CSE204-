Oh
Oh, oh
Baby, lately
Baby, yeah

The walls are all gone, did we melt 'em down? (Baby)
Liquid in my hands, liquid in my mouth (Oh)
Footage on my phone, did it with your tongue (Oh)
And now we're sticking close, and I understand

That baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately, I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground

I finally understand, finally understand
My therapist said I hate myself really bad
You tell me it's fine, let me cry and hug it out

That baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately, I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground

'Cause lately

Liquid in my hands, liquid in my mouth
Got me drippin' out, got me drippin' out
Many nights gone, finally understand
I finally understand, I finally understand
Feel it in my core and the feeling's raw
You love me even when I hate myself, I'm sure

That baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately, I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground
Baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately, I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground

Baby
