I took a look into your ocean heart
And ever since, I stumble through the dark
I'm like a moth attracted to a flame
'Cause since we've met, you know, I'll never be the same
(Oohh-ohh)

Oh, I'm like a tiger but in black and blue
'Cause all my bruises wanna  for you
I wonder if you'll ever know my name
I wonder if we'll ever ever meet again

What if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
1 2 3, oh!

I'm searching deserts and the morning skies
Just to stare into your diamond eyes
I'll build a rocket and I'll fly to space
Just so that I can touch your picture perfect face
Oh, your picture perfect face, oh

I wonder if you'll do the same for me
Or would you stay there and just let me be?
And all my blood will drip the color of gold
'Cause that's the love that runs for you within my soul

But what if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
But what if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
When if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
And when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
1 2 3, oh!
