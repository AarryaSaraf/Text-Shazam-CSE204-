Laying in silence
You were a diamond, bright
Yeah, touching my fingertips
Melting into the night, oh
Secrets are locked up
Prison cell in your mind
Kisses fall on her lips
Kisses that should've been mine, yeah

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Who you love, who you love
Who you love
I know I'm losing you, so come on, tell the truth
Don't you tell me you're sorry, don't pretend you still want me
'Cause I don't wanna know, I already know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done, ooh, ooh
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, ooh, ooh, ooh

Fighting the tears back
Fighting to make you stay
Screaming at angels
Holding a wall in my brain, yeah
Secrets are locked up
Prison cell in your heart, yeah
Kisses fall on her lips
The memory's left behind

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Who you love, who you love
Who you love
I know I'm losing you, so come on, tell the truth
Don't you tell me you're sorry, don't pretend you still want me
'Cause I don't wanna know, I already know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done, ooh, ooh
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, ooh, ooh, ooh
