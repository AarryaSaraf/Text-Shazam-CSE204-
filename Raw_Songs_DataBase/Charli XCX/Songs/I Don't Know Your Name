So lost and so alone, can't take it no more
You watch me lose control dancing on the floor

Wanna feel the pound of a heartbeat?
Do you wanna feel a rush when I go insane?
I wanna be unwrapped like a candy cane
The only ones you love, no time for pain
Wanna be a bad little secret?
Do you wanna feel the blood running through your veins?
I wanna be the girl inside your brain
But only for a night wanna play the game

I look to your eyes, they flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

Your touch electrifies my body and soul
You're such a sweet escape now I can't let go

I wanna lose myself in the passion
Do you wanna be my boy? Wanna run away?
I wanna stick with you on a kiss and chase
I can see me chilling at your place
Only one to be a distraction
Now the only thing I see seems to be your face
I wanna be the girl that keeps you safe
I only meant tonight, but it must be fate

I look to your eyes, they flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name

I, I will not just fall in love, fall in love right here
I, I can't fight this feeling, oh, feeling so lovesick
Oh, I really can't believe this, but it's so damn true
So much magic come between us
Now I'm all for you

I look to your eyes, they flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name
