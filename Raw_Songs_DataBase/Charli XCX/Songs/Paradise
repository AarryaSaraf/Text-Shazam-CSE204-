Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

Sparks burning in my heart
You guide me through the dark
I look at you, you feel it too
Hands, touching palm-to-palm
Connection feeling strong
We're wild and free, and I believe

Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

Yeah, we can make it right
Yeah, we can make it right
Yeah, we can make it right

Home, I found it in your eyes
You give me butterflies
And when we touch, I feel the rush
Sweet, just like a cherry drop
So please don't let it stop
In love with you, we're stuck like glue

Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

Runnin' away and surfin' on starlight
Rainbows and waterfalls in my dreams
Dancin' with you on top of the mountain
(Yeah, we can make it right)
Kissin' your lips and feeling electric
Fantasy blurrin' purple and green
Dancin' with you on top of the mountain
(Yeah, we can make it right)
