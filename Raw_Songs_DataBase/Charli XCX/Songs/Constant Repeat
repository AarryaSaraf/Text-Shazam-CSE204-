I'm focused on you
You're all on me too
I'm cute and I'm rude
And you like what I do
You said I run through your mind
So I put love on the line
I scared you away
You missed the chance of a lifetime

When you're lonely
Are you ever thinkin' 'bout the magic in me?
Do you wish I was yours?
When you're lonely (When you're lonely)
Am I ever on your mind on constant repeat?
Is it me that you want?

Do you realise
I could have been the one to change your life?
You could have had a bad girl by your side
You could have had a bad girl
Could have had a bad girl
If you wanted
Do you even know
The reasons why you had to let me go? (Do you know?)
You could have had a bad girl by your side
You could have had a bad girl
Could have had a bad girl
If you wanted

I'm focused on you
You're all on me too
Told you I'm cute and I'm rude
With kinda rare attitude
You said I'm still on your mind
But now I don't have the time
You should have been brave
You missed the chance of a lifetime

When you're lonely
Are you ever thinkin' 'bout the magic in me?
Do you wish I was yours?
When you're lonely (When you're lonely)
Am I ever on your mind on constant repeat?
Is it me that you want?

Do you realise
I could have been the one to change your life?
You could have had a bad girl by your side
You could have had a bad girl
Could have had a bad girl
If you wanted
Do you even know
The reasons why you had to let me go? (Do you know?)
You could have had a bad girl by your side
You could have had a bad girl
Could have had a bad girl
If you wanted

Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
