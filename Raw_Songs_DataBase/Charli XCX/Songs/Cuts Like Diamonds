You make me feel like I could sparkle through the night
You are beautiful like lightning
When you kiss me I'm electrified
You are like magic
You're my angel in the sky
You're my baby, never leave me
Catching all the tears I cry, oh
You're the glow in my heartbeat
You're the spark in the empty room
You're the song on the repeat
You're the star and you're in full bloom
And I hope that you know, I'ma always be right by your side
Crystals just don't satisfy

Hey, did you know that I'll always be in love with you?
I can't fake it, my heart's taken

Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone, worth finding
Give me your heart, give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds
Our love will burn down cities
Your love, the fire within me
Give me your hand, we are shining
Our love cuts like diamonds

I feel your power
We could take over the world
You're the apple of my eye
I know that I'm your only supergirl
Don't need no rubies, don't need emeralds or pearls
We are perfect just the way we are

Hey, did you know that I'll always be in love with you?
I can't fake it, my heart's taken

Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone, worth finding
Give me your heart, give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds
Our love will burn down cities
Your love, the fire within me
Give me your hand, we are shining
Our love cuts like diamonds

Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-ah
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-aye-aye-aye-ooh

Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone, worth finding
Give me your heart, give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds
Our love will burn down cities
Your love, the fire within me
Give me your hand, we are shining
Our love cuts like diamonds
Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone, worth finding
Give me your heart, give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds
Our love will burn down cities
Your love, the fire within me
Give me your hand, we are shining
Our love cuts like diamonds
