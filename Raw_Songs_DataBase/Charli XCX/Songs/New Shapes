What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
I ain't got it

I don't know why I got a tendency to run away
Don't know why I'm always pushing for a sweet escape
Even though I feel so close
I just can't control how I
Feel
And I gotta be free
Need to breathe
But sometimes I need

All night
All day
We could fall in love in new shapes
New shapes
When the morning comes
I'm sorry
I stayed
Tell you honestly, I can't change
Can't change

What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
What you want
I ain't got it
I ain't got it

What if I
Created places for you to let go
What if you
Wanted to watch because we both know
That now we are so close we don't have to fight how we feel
When the lights and the skins are a call so surrender to it

All night, all day
Then we fall in love in new shapes, new shapes
When the morning comes all misty, we fade
'Cause we fell in love in new shapes
In new shapes

What you want
I ain't got it (Got it)
What you want
(We could go on)
What you want
I ain't got it
I ain't got it

Thinking of me but you're stuck on the West side again
Maybe we're meant for another dimension, babe
Deep in the dark of your brain like a star in space
You call it art but you pulled out my heart
And you twisted it into a new shape
Yeah, I'm dive bombing again and again
Trying to get up close to you
Fucked if I know how it's gonna end
But honestly life would be better
If I never met you in the first place

What you want
I ain't got it (Yeah)
What you want
(I ain't got it)
What you want
I ain't got it
(Charli, Caroline, Chris)
What you want
(What you want, what you want)
I ain't got it (What you want)
What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
What you want
I ain't got it
(I ain't got it, baby)
I ain't got it
