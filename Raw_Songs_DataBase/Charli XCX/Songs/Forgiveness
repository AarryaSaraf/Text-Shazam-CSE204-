I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?
Fucked this up in front of everyone

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

I'm so cold
I'm the bad bitch, yo
Heart got froze
Don't trust those bros
Feel my love up high
I'll protect the prize
No love inside my eyes
Don't trust those guys

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?
Fucked this up in front of everyone

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

Sorry that my body like ice
Super hot supply, never gonna faze me
Sorry that my ice is so low
Queen bitch pro, vision so hazy
You keep on trying to break me down
But my wall stays high
It's protection like crazy
Sorry that I love you so
Gonna try to change but it's so hard, baby
And it's so hard, baby
