Ha ha ha ha

Light trips, sweat drips
Come party in my basement
Man, I'm gonna get you wasted
Yeah, just enough for you to taste it
Cash this, get rich
Feel it 'til you're famous
Party in my basement
Just enough for you to taste it

Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Come on people, let me through
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Making waves across the room
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I've got nothing left to lose
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I'm dropping bombs on you

Night shift, killed it
You won't need no replacement
I'm gonna make a statement
'Cause I wanna watch you chase it
Cash flow, down low
Money just like chocolate
I'm gonna make you famous
Come party in my basement

Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Come on people, let me through
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Making waves across the room
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I've got nothing left to lose
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I'm dropping bombs on you

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Can I get you? Can I get you?
Can I get you super-size? Can't you see it in my eyes?
You know I wanted that, I'm flashing out my dollar signs
Can I get you super-size? Can't you see it in my eyes?
You know I wanted that, I'm flashing out my dollar signs

Come party in my basement
Come party in my basement (Atomic)
Come party in my basement
Meow, woof woof, I'm making

Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Come on people, let me through
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Making waves across the room
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I've got nothing left to lose
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I'm dropping bombs on you
