I had to sit there and listen to poetry all day
And I tried to escape but they won't let run away
So I tried to hide, but they wouldn't let me hide
So I tried to find you, but I couldn't find you anywhere

And I was sitting next to you in the biology lecture
And I pretended I didn't understand just to capture your attention
And then I smiled, and then you smiled
And then I smiled, and it was all worth my while, oh
All worth my while

But later on by the sofa, I wanted to kiss you, I wanted to kiss you
But I couldn't get that close, no, I couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes
It was like you didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And I wanted to run away, yeah, I wanted to run away
'Cause I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not, yeah
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not

And I once told someone, they should write some golden poetry
'Cause it would get them far in the music industry
It'd do them good
And I guess that's what I'm doing now
I'm doing good, yeah
I knew I'd have to do it sometime

And I hope I get to see you on February the 14th
'Cause then I might be able to try this whole thing again some other time
Oh, you can be my Valentine
Oh, it's the time
Will you be my Valentine, -tine, Valentine?

But later on by the sofa, I wanted to kiss you, I wanted to kiss you
But I couldn't get that close, no, I couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes
It was like you didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And I wanted to run away, yeah, I wanted to run away
'Cause I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not, yeah
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not

Oh, I'm starting to worry that I'm sounding like The Fray
'Cause I hate the way they talk about sadness and life decay
But they must talk some sense if the knew how to save a life
But I never talk sense, no, I haven't done this right
Oh, I'm starting to worry that I'm sounding like The Fray
'Cause I hate the way they talk about sadness and life decay

But I never talk sense, no, I haven't done this right

Last year on the sofa, I wanted to kiss you, I wanted to kiss you
But I couldn't get that close, no, I couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes
It was like you didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And I wanted to run away, yeah, I wanted to run away
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not, yeah
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me
But obviously not, no

No, no, no, no
Obviously not, yeah, yeah, oh
Nah nah, yeah
Oh oh
