So hard, things that we've been through, yeah
Could've fallen, but we only grew, yeah (Uh)
So I made my house a home with you (Oh)
I'm right here and it feels brand new
I used to live inside a lie with you (With you)
And now we're honest and it feels so good (Ah, ah)

Hello, hello, hello, I see clearly
So long, been scared to show off my feelings
Hello, hello, hello, got new meanin'
Now I really see it

I know that look inside my eyes means always
Even if we fall apart, split two ways
Used to be afraid to say it, that's so strange
Seven years and it's been you and I, always
Really complicated, we're too deep, babe (Deep, babe)
Really sad, the way our song drives me insane (Me insane)
Used to be afraid to say it, now that's changed
Seven years and it's been you and I, always

Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, no

Oh yeah, I really, really love you for life (For life)
Without the Holy matrimony, I'm wife (I'm wife)
We went from distant to inseparable types (That's right)
Oh yeah, it's really, really, really, really nice (It's really nice)
And now I never, ever, ever think twice (Not twice)
'Cause you're exactly really, really my type (My type)
I think we took some sleeping pills on that flight (That flight)
The seven years, it really, really flown by (Swoosh)

I know that look inside my eyes means always (Always)
Even if we fall apart, split two ways (Two ways)
Used to be afraid to say it, that's so strange
Seven years and it's been you and I, always (Always)
Really complicated, we're too deep, babe (Deep, babe)
Really sad, the way our song drives me insane (Me insane)
Used to be afraid to say it, now that's changed
Seven years and it's been you and I, always

Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, no

(Always)
(Always) Yeah
(Now that's changed) Oh
I know that look inside my eyes means always
Even if we fall apart, split two ways (Now, now)
Yeah, that's so strange, always, yeah (Always)
I know that look inside my eyes means deep pain (So strange)
Really sad, the way our song drives me insane
(Now, now) Ooh
(No way) Oh, oh
Oh, yeah, yeah (So strange)
I, always (No way)
(Now that's changed) Ooh
(No, no, no way)
Seven years and it's been you and I, always (Always)
(So strange)
No, oh
