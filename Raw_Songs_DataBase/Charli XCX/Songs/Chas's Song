It was twenty-five past nine at night
And I was really bored
So I sat down with my guitar
But I needed some new chords
I spoke to my good friend, called Chas
He was an indie boy
With skinny jeans, and vintage shoes
And hair all over the shop

And he said
"Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go goo-goo eyed
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody
That you can sing along to, an indie tune
That will make the girls swoon
That a raver boy can dance to

I said it sounds okay
He said "Of course it does, you're a magician on guitar"
I said, "thank you love, I'm not that great
And I wouldn't go that far"
I've got this friend called Paul and his brain ain't small
He played the violin
But now he's a rocker, a leather jacket shocker
I wish I could play like him

He said
"Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go goo-goo eyed
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody
That you can sing along to, an indie tune
That will make the girls swoon
When a raver boy asks for a dance"
For a dance, for a dance

And he said
"Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go goo-goo eyed
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody
That you can sing along to, an indie tune
That will make the girls swoon
That a raver boy can dance to"
