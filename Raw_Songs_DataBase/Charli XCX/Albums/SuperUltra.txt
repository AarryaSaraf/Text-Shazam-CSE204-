// Moments In Love //

Ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh
Ah
Uh, ah-oh
La la la la la la la la
Oh, oh

I just wanna get high with my best friend
Kiss her on my tongue, just like I'm your boyfriend
I just wanna get high with my best friend
Kiss her on my tongue, just like I'm your boyfriend
On a roller coaster, this shit is super ultra
Shit so bright, like we're flying through the supernova
I just wanna get high with my best friend
Kiss her on my tongue, just like I'm your boyfriend

La da da da
La, oh, oh, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Na na na, na na na
Do, do, do, do
Da, da
Da, da, da, oh
Ohh, da-da-da, da-da

In love

// Velvet Dreaming (Luv) //

Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
To spend on loving you, to spend on loving you

I got the time to be your throwaway
If I get to hang with you every day
Sitting on the ground, drinking champagne
Flying 'round the world, private plane
You're like the best kind of Novocain
Super ease, take the pain away
Nice kinda numb, yeah, it's a-okay
Back of the car, I will stay smoking

Stay hot like fire
You are my one desire
But you will never tire
Because you always keep on taking me higher
Super sweet, like a French bon-bon
Super story, how you were gone, gone
You got my heart dressed up like a debutante
You're the apple of my eye and the only one

Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
To spend on loving you, to spend on loving you
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
To spend on loving you, to spend on loving you

I like it when you kiss the back of my neck
I like it that you show me super respect
You're not the kind of guy I think I'll regret
You're not the kind of guy I'm gonna forget
Sparkle in your heart always glows in the dark
Rainbows in the sky when we walk through the park
Hand in my hand, toes in the sand
Super ultra love for my man

Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
To spend on loving you, to spend on loving you
To spend on loving you, to spend on loving you

// Dance 4 U //

If you were gonna sing something to a girl to try and seduce her, what would you sing, and will you sing it for us?
Seduce her?!
Yup!
Uhh, I don't know, um... I've never tried to seduce a girl yet

Under your magic
Under your magic in the night
I twist and turn
But I can never put up a fight
You are like diamonds
You are like diamonds in the night
Ask me a question
You know I'll do anything, I'm hittin' the tides (dance)

Just stay
Just stay awake
Just lay
Just lay for me

You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance but you like what I do
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but I'll dance for you

Body electric
Lost in our hyper fantasy
I really feel it
I'm moving both my arms, yeah, it's happening
Lost all my feelings
I don't really care who's watchin' me
We're on a level
If they don't like what we do, well, they can just leave

You stay
You stay awake
You lay
You lay for me

You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance but you like what I do
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but I'll dance for you

Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber)
Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber)
Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber)
Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber), just in place

// Glow //

We came a long, long way
Through the wind and rain
I nearly sank my heart in the empty glass
Spent my time alone, but you're at the phone
And when I fall apart, I'll swim with the sharks

You'll always be right there
And I will always love you
You changed my vision when you said to me
(Uh...)

You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness
You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness

In the box of doom, in a hotel room
You're across the sea, but you're near to me
You know you gave me hope, and now I stay afloat
I used to sleep to scream
And now I sleep to dream of you

You'll always be right there
And I will always love you
You changed my vision when you said to me
(Uh...)

You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness
You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness
You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness
You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness

// Heatwave //

It's gonna be a heatwave
The sun is shining through the clouds
I put my love into your mouth
And I feel so high, I can't come down
A heatwave
I feel your magic on my skin
You dance around me in the wind
Open your heart and let me in

I wanna dance in the sunlight
Get me on my knees
I'm gonna kiss your body in the summer breeze
You got a killer smile and I love your steez
Come on kiss my body, I'm begging please

You are a super special, take me home
Our love extra special, tastes like gold
This is another level, oh my God
I know you need it 'cause you're screaming

It's gonna be a heatwave
The sun is shining through the clouds
I put my love into your mouth
And I feel so high, I can't come down
A heatwave
I feel your magic on my skin
You dance around me in the wind
Open your heart and let me in

I wanna dance in the sunlight
Get me on my knees
I'm gonna kiss your body in the summer breeze
You got a killer smile and I love your steez
Come on kiss my body, I'm begging please

You know I like it
When we're playing in the summer breeze
I know you like to tease me
You've always got me on my knees
I'm falling for you more and more
Every time I stare into your buttercup eyes

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
(I'm in love)

// Cold Nites (Remix) //

Cold nites and harder days
Better lie down and lay away
Have a heart facing foreign places
Tired of seeing love, tired of waiting

Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this

Hey, yeah, oh
Hope you know I miss you
Know that I want to kiss you
You said that I was the bestest bitch that ever stuck with you
After all the shit we've been through
How come you cannot see through?
We're stuck on automatic
Never there when I really need you

This shit for real, this shit is danger
You come around my house
And you act like a motherfucking total stranger

Anytime that I see you, baby
Anytime that I see you, lately
Hoping I'm safe for a while
Safe for a while

Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this

Now what would I change to get you back to my arms again?
Instead that my life made you in love with a different man
If in my time you would pass my life
Could I still take you as my love
Tell me what I wanna do, tell what I gotta do better

Hey, yeah, oh
Hey
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this

I can't see from how hard I'll be in where I'll stay
I pray for myself again

// Forgiveness //

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?
Fucked this up in front of everyone

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

I'm so cold
I'm the bad bitch, yo
Heart got froze
Don't trust those bros
Feel my love up high
I'll protect the prize
No love inside my eyes
Don't trust those guys

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?
Fucked this up in front of everyone

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
Do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

Sorry that my body like ice
Super hot supply, never gonna faze me
Sorry that my ice is so low
Queen bitch pro, vision so hazy
You keep on trying to break me down
But my wall stays high
It's protection like crazy
Sorry that I love you so
Gonna try to change but it's so hard, baby
And it's so hard, baby
