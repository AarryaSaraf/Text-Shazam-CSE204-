Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride

Lavender Lamborghini, roll up in a blue bikini
Bitches on the beaches, lookin' super cute and freaky
All my friends are princesses, we keep it whipped and creamy
Ice cubes on our tongues, because we like to keep it freezy
Lavender Lamborghini, get out on the right side
Chauffeur stayed at home, because my girl wanted to ride
Lookin' luxe and tastin' plush, I'm feelin' so alive
Want to take it to the highway, come on, let's go for a drive, uh

All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
So let me ride, let me ride
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time
So let's ride

(Vroom vroom) Bitches know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
(Vroom vroom) Those slugs know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Beep beep, so let's ride
(Vroom vroom) Bitches know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
(Vroom vroom) Those slugs know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Beep beep, so let's ride

Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride

Bubblegum-pink Ferrari, yeah, I'm so bossy
Speedin' like Alonso just to crash your party
People are goin' loco when I'm pullin' up, takin' your papi
Don't think about consequences, 'cause they're never gonna stop me, what?

All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
So let me ride, let me ride
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time
So let's ride

(Vroom vroom) Bitches know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
(Vroom vroom) Those slugs know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Beep beep, so let's ride
(Vroom vroom) Bitches know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
(Vroom vroom) Those slugs know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Beep beep, so let's ride

Boom, boom, boom
Hear me comin' through the radio
Watch me go zoom, zoom, zoom
Try to catch me, but you're too slow
Boom, boom, boom
Hear me comin' through the radio
Know they can't catch me
Watch me go zoom, zoom, zoom
Know they can't catch me
Try to catch me, but you're too slow
Too slow, too slow

// Paradise //

Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

Sparks burning in my heart
You guide me through the dark
I look at you, you feel it too
Hands, touching palm-to-palm
Connection feeling strong
We're wild and free, and I believe

Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

Yeah, we can make it right
Yeah, we can make it right
Yeah, we can make it right

Home, I found it in your eyes
You give me butterflies
And when we touch, I feel the rush
Sweet, just like a cherry drop
So please don't let it stop
In love with you, we're stuck like glue

Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

Runnin' away and surfin' on starlight
Rainbows and waterfalls in my dreams
Dancin' with you on top of the mountain
(Yeah, we can make it right)
Kissin' your lips and feeling electric
Fantasy blurrin' purple and green
Dancin' with you on top of the mountain
(Yeah, we can make it right)

// Secret (Shh) //

(Yeah)
Good girls shouldn't party
We do what we supposed to do
Speak, but never shout it
Get home, be in bed by two
But I don't wan' follow that, that no more
I see myself all over you for sure
You got me breaking all the rules
Leggo, leggo

If I share my secret, secret, ah ah
Promise you'll keep it, keep it down
If I share my secret, ah ah
No one gets to know but you
No one gets to know but shh

Shh
Shh
Shh
Shh

(Ah ha ha, mmm)
Please don't tell nobody
I'm ready to climb the walls
I know that you want it
I'm ready to give it all
I feel like an animal on all fours
I see myself all over you for sure
You got me breaking all the rules
Leggo, leggo

If I share my secret, secret, ah ah
Promise you'll keep it, keep it down
If I share my secret, ah ah
No one gets to know but you
No one gets to know but shh

Shh
Shh
Shh
Shh

Under the glimmering lights, my secret's out
Now I got nothing to hide, come tear me down
Shimmering all through the night, I'm tempted by you
It's all true, oh

No-no-no-no-no one gets to know but you
No-no-no-no-no one gets to know but
Know but you, you, you, you
No one gets to know but you
No-no-no-no-no one gets to know but shh

Shh

If I share my secret, secret, ah ah
Promise you'll keep it, keep it down
If I share my secret, ah ah
No one gets to know but you
No one gets to know but shh
