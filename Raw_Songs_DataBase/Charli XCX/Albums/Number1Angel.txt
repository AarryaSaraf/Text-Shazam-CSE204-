Even though, even though, even though
It hurts what you put me through
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Who gets my head so fucked up

Who makes me scream
Even though, even though, even though
It hurts what you put me through
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, yeah

It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' (Callin')
You say you're sorry, but you're lonely (Lonely)
You know the words that got me fallin'
I got to pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love
One thousand times, the same old story (Story)
I hate myself, I can't control it (-Trol it)
You know the words that got me fallin'

My friends keep on tellin' me
Let it go, let it go, let it go
I just don't care
Even though, even though, even though
I know that you're usin' me
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
Feelin' good, feelin' good, feelin' good
It's better than ecstasy
Feelin' good, feelin' good, feelin' good

Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love

In the beginning, I thought you were amazin'
And none of my friends could stop me from chasin' you
I was too blind to see through all the flames, babe
But now, I don't wanna care anymore
Yes, all the things she said to me, just a lie
How could I be so dumb?
I don't wanna care anymore (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
You're just pretty, you're not free
I'm so over your vanity
Oh man, I don't wanna care anymore (Oh-oh-oh)
No, no, no, no

It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' (Callin')
Go fuck yourself, don't say you're sorry (Sorry)
I can't believe I used to want this
No more, no
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up (Right to your love, oh-oh)
One thousand times, the same old story (Story)
Forgive myself, now this is over (Over, oh)
I can't believe you had me fallin'
No more, no
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up (Whoa-oh-oh)
Pull up, pull up right to your love

Uh, uh (Your love)
Da-da, ooh, your love
Uh, uh (Your love)

// Emotional //

All over, deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control

Both got the feelin'
Hit like karate
Had boyfriends and girlfriends
We wanted to touch, but we could never make any moves
Both got the feelin'
Guilty desire
Your body, my body
We were close, but still so far away

When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin' right from wrong, tellin' right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it's so emotional

All over, deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional

The car in the driveway
The questions in her mouth
This secret is risky
So we have to keep all these fantasies to ourselves
Clothes on the carpet
Over at my house
I wish we could do it
We came so close, but still we push away

When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin' right from wrong, tellin' right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it's so emotional

All over
Deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin' right from wrong, tellin' right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it's so emotional

All over
Deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
(You got me so emotional)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Yeah, it's so emotional

// ILY2 //

I love you too
I love you too
I love you too
You know, I love you too

Lookin' at you, lookin' at me
We think the same things
I wanna take this seriously, oh (oh)
Don't wanna dance alone
So come here with me
You're made of glass, I'm made of stone
One more thing to say before you go

I don't talk a lot, talk a lot
So you should listen up, I mean it when I say
I'm not afraid, it's okay
You know, I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
You know, I love you too

Now you're with me, and now I'm with you
We're here forever
How does it feel knowin' the truth? Oh (oh)
Don't wanna dance alone
So come here with me
You're in a class, all of your own
One more thing I've got to let you know

I don't talk a lot, talk a lot
So you should listen up, I mean it when I say
I'm not afraid, it's okay
You know, I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
You know, I love you too

You know I never really thought about
How it feels to say these words aloud
It's so weird, but it's true
Do you ever even think about
How it feels when you are not around?
I'm gonna stay here, 'cause I love you too
'Cause I love you too

I don't talk a lot, talk a lot
So you should listen up, I mean it when I say
I'm not afraid, it's okay
You know, I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
You know, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too, I love you too
You know, I love you too

// White Roses //

(Maybe my)
Eh-eh-XCX
(Maybe my, uhh)

Maybe my only light
Don't you recognise
You're the only one I want, uhh
Cold like ice, petrified, uhh
Loving what you're doing to me
(Doin' to me)

White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lying in your bed and movin' slow
Taking off our clothes
Giving you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close
Lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

You'll be mine every night
I'm trying to advertise
You're the only one I want, uhh
Hold me tight, yeah, Marlboro Light, uhh
Loving what you're doing to me

White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lying in your bed and moving slow
Taking off our clothes
Giving you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close
Lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

We're gonna melt down
Gonna disappear into the sun, into the sun
Gonna burn down together like fire
We can't get enough
(No, no, no, no)
We're tied like white roses
You know we're never coming undone, coming undone
'Cause I wanna stay forever
I know that you're the only one, only one

White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lying in your bed and moving slow
Taking off our clothes
Giving you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close
Lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

(Ooh, aah, yeah)
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

// Babygirl //

If you're feeling real sad, just look on your wall
I'm your pin-up princess, yeah, you know who to call
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I've got a million dollar smile, I can live in your dreams
With my angel wings and Fiorucci jeans
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Close your eyes and lay back
Think about us, we could burn up the second we touch
Yeah, let your mind just relax
We could play rough, make your blood rush, velveteen brush

I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl

Gloss on my lips, pop, sun in my eyes
Go steal the liquor from inside
Wanna take a little sip with you
Wanna spend a little bit with you
Open the top, pop, drink in my glass
Here come the cop cops, better drink fast
Wanna take a little sip with you
Wanna spend a little bit with you

Just close your eyes and lay back
Think about us, we could burn up the second we fuck
Yeah, let your mind just relax
We could play rough, make your blood rush, velveteen brush

I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl

I'm hanging all alone
Let me live inside your world, hmm
More than a fantasy
Let me be your baby girl, hmm

I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl

Baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
Baby girl, your baby girl (haha, sassy babes)
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl

// Drugs //

Dealer, dealer, dealer
Eh-eh-XCX

Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it
You know I want it
And baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it
You know I want it

Calling out for your love
Baby, I'm calling out, I can't do without you
Put ecstasy on my tongue and that's all I'm tasting now
You're luxurious, I'm stuck
Champagne, cigarettes, convertibles
It's 'bout to pop off
Bitin' on a rose, you make me cum
I'm way up, rooftop
You hurt me when you stop
I just can't get enough, dealer

Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it
You know I want it
You're selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you the love of my life
Baby, you got it
You know I want it

I was never great at dealing with no comedown
So feel free to come 'round when you wanna come 'round
You're my favourite drug, just take me to your underworld
And put me on your tongue, hallucinate until your toes curl
Tsu-tsunami, you can't stop me now, I'm peaking too
Off the kiki and hypnotic, I'm not through with you
When you cum, it feels like diamonds raining down on me
When I'm with you, heaven on Earth is not a fantasy
Roll the windows down, my wrists awry, you got me so cold
Bitin' on a flower, blood like water down from my nose
It hurts, but I can't stop
I just can't get enough
(I can't get enough)

Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
(Selling all the drugs that I like)
Baby, you got it
You know I want it (Yeah)
And baby, you the love of my life
