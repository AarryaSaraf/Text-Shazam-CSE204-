// One More Year //

Do you remember, we were standing here a year ago
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
But now I worry our horizon's been nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did, one day, on a whim
Has slowly become all we do

I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die
And now I fear we might
Ooh, now I fear we might

But it's okay
I think there's a way
Why don't we just say, "One more year"? (One more year)
Not worrying if I get the right amount of sleep (One more year)
Not caring if we do the same thing every week (One more year)
Of living like I'm only living for me (One more year)
Of never talking about where we're gonna be (One more year)
One more year
Of living like the free spirit I wanna be

We got a whole year (One more year)
Fifty-two weeks
Seven days each (One more year)
Four seasons
One reason
One way
One year (One more year)
One year
One year
From today
From today

I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
Now one of these is gonna be the last for all time
For all time
One more year

// Instant Destiny //

I'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami, go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm

This traffic doesn't seem quite as annoying
Quite alright, quite alright, sittin' here
Yes, reminiscent, I think this is different
I know this is different (I'm about to)
Let's cause something permanent
Just so we know we can

I'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
Did you say "And here comes forever"?
Oh, here for ages, let go of me with open arms

We'll be lovers until the end of time (I'm about to)
I see it now
I see just how you're so right (I'm about to)
You're so clear now

I'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami, go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm

Let's drink this magic potion
Of love and devotion
And then let's see how it goes

// Posthumous Forgiveness //

Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way
I always thought heroes stay close
Whenever troubled times arose

I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes

Every single word you told me
I believed without a question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself

Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise-up as I grow?

And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time, you had a chance
But you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave

Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise-up as I grow?
Did you hope I'd never doubt?
Never one day work it out?

You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I suffered
What a thing to discover
There was time to recover
One-on-one with each other
Just a boy and a father
What I'd give for another

Everything that I have
Wouldn't need this for long
Never speak of the time
That you left us alone
Me and Steve on our own
I wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Learn the words, sing along

(This time) Wanna tell you 'bout the time
(I know) I was in Abbey Road
Or the time that I had
Mick Jagger on the phone
I thought of you when we spoke
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Hear your voice sing along
I wanna say it's alright
You're just a man after all
And I know you have demons
I got some of my own
Think you passed 'em along
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
And hear your voice sing along

// Breathe Deeper //

If you think I couldn't hold my own
Believe me I can believe me I can believe me I can
If it ain't so awful and we're all together
I can believe me I can believe me I can
If you think I couldn't owe it up
Believe me I can believe me I can believe me I can
If ideally we should feel like this forever
I can believe me I can believe me I can

Would you say seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
Would you say now you're having fun?
So do this and get through this and come find me when you're done
So we can be as one

If you think I couldn't hold my own
Believe me I can believe me I can believe me I can
If you need someone to tell you that you're special
I can believe me I can believe me I can
If you need someone to carry on
Believe me I can believe me I can believe me I can
If you think that I was feeling what you're feeling, 
I am believe me I am believe me I am

And the groove is low

Would you say seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this 
(And the groove is low)
And come find me when you're done
So we can be as one

'Til the mornin'
'Til the mornin'
Oh
And the groove is low
'Til the mornin'
And the groove is low

Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper should you need to come undone
('Til the mornin')
And let those colors run
Now you're having fun
('Til the mornin')
Do this and get through this and until we see the sun
(And the groove is low)
You're my number one

'Til the mornin'
(Would you say?)
And the groove is low
'Til the mornin'
And the groove is low

We're both adults
But we behave like children
Long as we got
Enough to keep on living

'Til the mornin'
'Til the mornin'

// Tomorrow's Dust //

There's no use trying to relate to that old song
And no use trying to debate that they've got it wrong
There's no use pining for love when you're on your own
And no use crying outside if nobody's home
There's no use flying to the moon if they won't believe
So why do I go on, on repeat?

I was blinded by your memory
Like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be learning fast
And the day will come and then it will pass

What do you want when I say I won't?
And though I try, I do the same, as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust

There's no use trying to relate to that old song
And no use biding your time if the bell is tolled

I was blinded by your memory
Like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be learning fast
And the day will come and then it will pass

Sympathy for the fauna
Fragile life in the sauna
In the sea getting warmer
Endlessly 'round the corner

And though I try, I do the same, as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust

// On Track //

I close my front door and turn on the light
I let out a breath and hold in a sigh
Ain't nothin' new, ain't that much inside
And if I'm counting days, dream fruition ain't what it's looking like

But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Strictly speaking, I'm holding on
One other minor setback
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
And all of my dreams are still in sight
Strictly speaking, I've got my whole life
I lost a wheel a while back
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Trouble keeps falling in my lap
Strung out again, but still on track

I know it's unrealistic, over-optimistic
I know I tried before this, I know it's nearly August
I know I can't ignore this, looking forward to all this
Sayin', "Babe, I just adore this" and, "Babe, can we afford this?"
I know it's been a slow year, nothin' much to show here
I didn't really go for it, so not a lot to show for it

The hardest part is over, adjusting makes it slower
So glad you're coming over, I want to bring us closer
The world ain't changin' for ya', nothin' to lose it over
We're just a shuttle over, the rest comes easy
The rest comes easy

('Cause life's like that)
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Strictly speaking, I'm holding back
Troubles keep falling in my lap, yeah
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
So tell everyone I'll be alright
'Cause, strictly speaking, I've got my whole life
One other major setback
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track, yeah

The hardest part is over, adjusting makes it slower
So glad you're coming over, I want to bring us closer
The world ain't waitin' for ya', nothin' to lose it over
I just kept getting older, the rest gets easy
The rest gets easy

// Lost In Yesterday //

When we were living in squalor,
Wasn't it heaven?
Back when we used to get on it
Four outta seven

Now even though that was a time I
Hated from day one
Eventually, terrible memories
Turn into great ones

So if they call you
Embrace them
If they hold you
Erase them

'Cause it might have been something, who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you mighta missed something, don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been digging it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might have been something, don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday

Matty said life didn't go the
Way that he planned it
Said, "Oh, what I'd give to start over
Boy, I'd command it"

So what was I ever afraid of,
Why did I worry?
And why was I ever so brainless?
Head in a flurry

'Cause if they call you
Embrace them
If they stall you
Erase them

'Cause it might have been something, who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you mighta missed something, don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been digging it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might have been something, don't say
'Cause it has to stay lost in yesterday

So if it calls you
Embrace it
If it haunts you
Face it

I know it's mad
I understand
It's only snakes
And ladders
The period
You never had
There's only one
That matters

And if it calls you
Embrace it
If it holds you
Erase it (replace it)

// Is It True //

We were hangin' in the morning
Feelin' all different kinds of things
We were talkin' about everything
From the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But, how can I know that I'll always be?

She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now!"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I in some kind of mood? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my

I was happy just listening
No intention to be mentioning
We started talkin' 'bout the future
'Bout the notion I was motioning
I'm just so terrified to face her
Like any moment I might wake up
Cause she's the only thing I think of
I don't know nothing but I love her

She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now!"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I being immature? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my

(In my) I said, "We'll see"
We'll see
(In my) We'll see

Oh
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
We'll see
See how it go
Until we know
What the future holds

Oh
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
We'll see

// It Might Be Time //

Something doesn't feel right
That's enough for one night
Hope y'all get home alright
There I go, blame it on the weather

But hey, there's nothin' wrong
I'm only tired of all these voices
Always sayin' nothing lasts forever

It might be time to face it
It ain't as fun as it used to be, no
You're goin' under
You ain't as young as you used to be
It might be time to face it
You ain't as cool as you used to be, no
You won't recover
You ain't as young as you used to be

It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it

I've been lost before
So tell me it's not over
'Cause I finally got somethin' goin'
And suddenly
All my friends are growin' up
And movin' on
I must be missin' somethin'

'Cause I just wanna keep this dream alive for now
Don't they know, nothin' lasts forever?

It might be time to face it
Nobody knows what you've come here for, no
You're goin' under
They roll their eyes when you're at the door

It might be time
It might be time to face it (Yeah)
You may as well embrace it

We promise to come visit (Yeah)
It might be time

It might be time to face it (Yeah)
You ain't as fun as you used to be
You won't recover
You ain't as cool as you used to be

It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it

// Glimmer //

It's like, "Oh, bass," cool
You know how you make the bass better?
Crank the bass up (Yeah)
You know how to make the kick drums better?
Just crank the bass up
And then it's like, "No, not really"

I just want a glimmer of hope
I just want a glimmer of hope
I just want a glimmer of hope
I just want a glimmer of hope
I just want a glimmer of hope
I just want a glimmer of hope

// One More Hour //

Just a moment
Right before all the singing ends
Wasn't brave enough to tell you
That there ain't gonna be another chance
It's not gone until (All that I have)
And everything's still (One more hour)
Minutes erasing, whatever I've done
I did it for love (All that I have)
I did it for fun (One more hour)
Couldn't get enough (All that I have)
I did it for fame (One more hour)
But never for money
Not for houses, not for her
Not for my future children
Until now

How could I love again?
How could I ever ask for more?
And to the road ahead
Into a life I can't ignore
(Lose her) How could I love again?
(Move her) How can I love this path for sure?
(Lose her) With no more time to spare
(Move her) I know the answer more and more

As long as I can, long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can, long as I can
Be the man I am

Ooh life is strange
One more hour
I could wait
One more hour

As long as I can (Lose her) As long as I can (Move her)
Spend some time alone
As long as I can (Lose her) As long as I can (Move her)
Remember who I am
As long as I can (Lose her) As long as I can (Move her)
Spend some time alone
As long as I can (How could I love again?) As long as I can
Be the man I am

Just a minute batter up before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute, babe
One more hour and you know your life is one to share
Just a minute baby right before we go through here
All these people said we wouldn't last a minute, dear
I'm with you and I can roll into another year
Just a minute batter up before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute, babe
One more hour and you know your life is one to share
Just a minute baby right before we go through here
All these people said they wouldn't last a minute, dear
I'm with you and I can roll into another year
Just a minute batter up before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute there
