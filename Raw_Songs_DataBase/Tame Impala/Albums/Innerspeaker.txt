// Desire Be Desire Go //

Feel it come, I don't know how long
It's gonna stay with me, I'll let desire be, desire go
Oh, dare I face the real world

Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, everyday
Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll get out, won't have to check my watch

I don't have the verve to belong to this dead side
Why I ever tried, I don't know
Oh, dare I face the real world

Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, everyday
Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll forget try to let desire be, desire go

Feel, feel it come, feel it come
Feel it come, I don't know how long
It's gonna stay with me, I'll let desire be, desire go

// It Is Not Meant To Be //

I wanted her, I wanted her
But she doesn't like the life that I lead
She doesn't like the life that I lead
Doesn't like sand stuck on her feet
Or sitting around smoking weed
I must seem more like a friend in need

And I boast that it is meant to be
But in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move
And in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move

And she doesn't like the friends that I make
Doesn't make friends for friendship's sake
She just gets bored sitting by the lake
Her soul won't surface and her heart won't ache

And I boast that it is meant to be
But in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move

And I thought they could cure his disease
But in all honesty he didn't have a hope in hell
Now we'll never see him move

// Alter Ego //

Said the voice from afar, don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?
Waiting for everyone else around to agree
Might take too long, might take too long
When it won't be so hard (it won't be so hard)
Well it's true, yes but you won't get far telling me

That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do, oh alter ego

Get them to love you while they may depending on your words and wealth
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Nobody else, nobody else
If I could part it wouldn't be so hard (it wouldn't be so hard)
Well it's true, yes but you won't get far telling me

That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do, oh alter ego

// Lucidity //

I know where you went but I don't know how you got there
I know where you went but I don't know how you got there
Silver tongue hill where you talk up what I'd play down
I would speak up but I wouldn't know what to say

Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh, it's hard to tell, it breaks down
There is a will, there is a way

Wondering around like spare time never knew it
I might suck fizzle or I might just float away

And we'll go running off tonight
High above, where we won't even need to reach the sky
My love, oh, there will be a change in the air
Nobody will be anybody else
Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh, where we'll go, tiptoe
Tread boldly right down to the lair

// Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind? //

Why won't you make up your mind? Give me a sign!
Why won't you make up your mind? Give me a sign!
Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead

Why won't you make up your mind? Give me a sign!
Why won't you make up your mind? Give me a sign!
Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead

// Solitude Is Bliss //

Cracks in the pavement underneath my shoe
I care less and less about and less about you
No one else around to look at me
So I can look at my shadow as much as I please
All the kicks that I can't compare to
Making friends like you're all supposed to

You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

Space around me where my soul can breathe
I've got body that my mind can leave
Nothing else matters, I don't care what I miss
Company's okay, solitude is bliss
There's a party in my head and no one is invited

And you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

Movement doesn't flow quite like it does when I'm alone
I'll be the one who's free
You and all your friends can watch me, today
Don't ask me how you're supposed to feel

You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

// Expectation //

Everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love
Stuck on thinking that there is always something to lose
Or a hit from above
Or a hit from above
I don't need what I'm holding
What I'm holding on, I wish I didn't know

But meanwhile...

Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Expectation is taking its toll
'Cause everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love

And then I would escape
I'll never, ever have to see another disappointed face
No one to please
Every now and then, it feels like
In all of the universe, there is nobody for me
I told myself I wouldn't care, no I wouldn't care
But when she said she'd come 'round
I combed my hair, yes, I checked my hair

Oh, and meanwhile, meanwhile, meanwhile...

Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuation does make me feel old
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul

// The Bold Arrow Of Time //

Overhead ether flow, moment, colors run
Time so slow, slow

I've never seen the arrow of time fly
So low

And time flows on

// Runway, Houses, City, Clouds //

But don't remind me of home, there's everywhere I'd rather go
It's true that some things have to change
And don't remind me of home or I might notice where I am

It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change
It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change

And gazing out the window as I ascend into the sky

But I'm the one who's left behind
I'm the one who's left behind
There is nothing that is safe
I know some things have to change

Yeah, I do, yeah, I do
But don't remind me of home, incase it isn't quite the same

// I Don't Really Mind //

Shifting, shifting, shifting aloud like it makes so much difference to me
Huffing, puffing, marching around like I know how much better it should be
I know it looks like I disagree, nine tenths of the time

But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind

Childhood puppy is old and gruff, your mother wants to give him away
Pillar of strength was lifted off his deathbed, 3 weeks ago today

But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind

But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind...
