// Be Above It //

Gotta be above it...

And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that I can't let them bring me down
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd

And I know that I gotta be above it now

And I know that I gotta be above it now

And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I cannot let them all just bring me down

This time I'm just gonna take or I'm never gonna shake it, 
I'll just close my eyes and make so that all these little things don't affect me now

I know that I gotta be above it now
And I cannot let them all just bring me down

This time I'm just gonna take or I'm never gonna shake it, 
I'll just close my eyes and make so that all these little things don't affect me now

Gotta be above it...

// Endors Toi //

Soothing repeat,
I look down at my feet,
It's a hypnotist's arm,
And it works like a charm.
But I won't be deprived,
Real worlds, surreal life,
Do or die,
There is time,
Go to sleep,
You'll be fine.

In the morning you'll find,
Real life was such a grind.
Off I go, day is done
Where a new one's just begun.

// Apocalypse Dreams //

This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
'Til we're at the end of just another day

Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified

Oh it feels so real in my sleep
Never felt so good, so close I do with you
Into the day, the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear?

Everything is changing
And there's nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here

Well, am I getting closer?
Will I ever get there?
Does it even matter?
Do I really need it?
Push it out the window

[Voice 1 - simultaneously:]
On and on we all go
Into another morning
Does it even matter?
It was only yesterday
Didn't even know you
Now I'm gonna miss you

[Voice 2 - simultaneously in background:]
This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
Oh it feels so real in my sleep
Never felt so good, so close I do

Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your hair
Looks the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should warn my mum
But she'll just be excited

// Mind Mischief //

Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong

How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge running low
I tried to fill but it overflowed

Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong

She remembers my name
Could be blown way out...
It's all going to change
She remembers my name

But she was only messing around
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go with mr. Right just for once!
Oooh, no more mischief with my mind

Then it all just came out
Guess I'll hold it in next time...

No more getting it wrong
I'll be frozen here on
If forever we'll see
No more guessing for me

Oh, I was just so sure of everything
Ooh, that's what you get for dreaming aloud

Then it all just came out
Guess I'll hold it in next time...
If forever we'll see
But no more guessing for me.

// Music To Walk Home By //

But that's only when I think of you,
Some vision that I hold on to,
You know it's everything I do,
You know it's everything I do.

Can almost stand competing with the others
Can almost hear the fun that I should be having.
Instead of all this dreaming...

But it's only when I think of you,
The mover I could turn into,
There must be something I can do,
There must be something I can do.

But I just don't know
How to feel right,
A beautiful girl
Is wasting my life,
I'm playing a part
As somebody else,
While trying so hard
To be myself.
I just need to hear
Somebody say,
That this will make sense one day.
I guess I'm alright
But they're all doing so well,
What I would give
To be under that spell...

You'll know soon.

In so many ways
I'm somebody else
I'm trying so hard
To be myself.
I just need to hear
Somebody say
That this will all make
Sense one day.

Well it's getting late
I'd better go
I made it this far
As far as I know.

// Why Won't They Talk To Me? //

Out of this zone, trying to see
I'm so alone, nothing for me
I guess I'll go home, try to be sane
Try to pretend, none of it happened
Oh, this old tree, lonely old me
Whoopsie-daisy, I thought I was happy, oh
Out of this zone, now that I see
I don't need them and they don't need me
I guess I'll go home, try to be sane
Try to pretend, none of it happened
Destined to be, lonely old me
Whoopsie-daisy, I thought I was happy, oh

Ah, why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?

But I don't really care about it anyway
I wouldn't listen to a word any of them say
They just talk about themselves all day
One day I'll be a star, they'll be sorry

Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?

// Feels Like We Only Go Backwards //

It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards, darling.

I know that you think, you sound
Silly when you call my name (my name)
But I hear it inside my head all day.
When I realize I'm just holding onto
The hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show...

It feels like I only go backwards, baby.
Every part of me says go ahead.
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards, darling.

The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no,
'Cause I decided long ago.
But that's the way it seems to go when trying
So hard to get to something real,
It feels...

It feels like I only go backwards, darling,
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards, darlin'.

Feels like I only go backwards, baby,
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards, darling.

Feels like I only go backwards, baby,
Every part of me says "go ahead".
I got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards, darling.

// Keep On Lying //

All I give are little clues
Maybe one day I'll get through
There is nothing I can do
I just keep on lying to you

I only need to say it's true
Only heart already knew
But there is nothing you can do
I just keep on lying to you,

Should my cover ever blow
Would you ever let it go
There is something you should know
But hell if I'd ever let it show

So here I am trying to be strong
It was noon and my shadow's long
I guess I'll go a day just as soon 
As I get to the end of this song,
To the end of this song,
To the end of this song,
To the end of this song,
To the end of this song...

You won't be alone
Take all you can
Please understand
That it never really was love

All I give are little clues
Maybe one day I'll get through
There is nothing they could do
I just keep on lying to you

// Elephant //

Well, he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreaming about being loved by him.

Too bad your chances are slim

And it's not like mister shook to get shy when they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down in the dark down there

He's not too easily scared

He's got friends but they got fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh, look see there he is now coming down the stairs

Here he comes

He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact

Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one been remembered a thing when they saw him again

That's how it is 'til the end
Yeah

// She Just Won't Believe Me //

But she just won't believe me, 
She just won't believe me
I never meant to see him 
But she just won't believe me

// Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control //

Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you I don't know
Maybe I'm just reading into it a little deeper than I should
We would make it easy, we would take it slowly if only we could

[Spoken:]
Hey, what are you doing out here?
You're thinking about everything, aren't you?
I know it's crazy, just don't think of it like that
Nothing has to mean anything
Come on, come back inside

Melody, look at me
Unless you're trying to hurt me
Heavy blow, down I go
Now I just want to let go
Is it right? Is it wrong? I don't know
It's not the cause I'm fighting for anymore
But it sucks to keep on running
Eventually, there will be
A time for clearer thinking
For now, I weep, can't get to sleep
I try to hold a good feeling
I just get one, here it comes, there it goes
Now we just might lose the fight, yeah
But it's alright, it wasn't our decision

Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you what I know
Every man is happy until happiness is suddenly a goal
I'll just be here waiting 'til the doctor calls and then I'll let you know

// Sun's Coming Up //

All those things I ever
Thought would never end
To think there now all memories
Sends me 'round the bend
Watch the airplanes swaying,
Coming in to land
Then my world is hanging
In someone else's hands
And if I've done something,
You have to let me go
Think of me as someone,
Someone that you know
But if I don't hear something,
Pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect completely,
See how that works out

I wasn't daring not much a chancer
Oh my darling, why won't you answer?
Seven AM, midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now, I guess it's over
Playing his guitar while he's dying of cancer
Oh my father, why won't you answer?
Seven AM, midnight in Dover
Suns comin' up now, I guess it's over

// Led Zeppelin //

Senses taking over, thought to set me free
I tried to get up but it was pouring down on me
Keeps on getting deeper, desperately to be
Said there's some guy interested in dragging it out of me
Oh, it's what I need, oh

Tell me you're in love to let it show

Just making magic, I was far enough to see it
Better than to get just what a stranger did to me
Is it because I love, is it because I don't, well, I just don't know
Keep on asking me, darling, let me see it, keep on asking
Is there any way to let it go?
