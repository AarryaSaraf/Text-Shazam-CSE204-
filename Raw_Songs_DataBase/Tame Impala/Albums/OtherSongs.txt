// Borderline //

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know?
How was I to know this dark emotion?

We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
Asking how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
(If you and I get comfortable)

We're on the borderline 
(On the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time 
(Then I saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Is there room, room for doubt?
As within, as without you

Will I be so in love?
Getting closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done?
R.I.P., here comes the sun

Here comes the sun

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with somethin'
How could I have known?
How was I to know this life get no shame?

I said, "Come with me outside
I need to clear my mind
This weight is crashing
Do you see the light
Oh, coming from their eyes?
Oh, no.
And I couldn't get away."

We're on the borderline
Gets me every time
These close encounters
Just to know I can
(Just to know I can)
Once again I am alone

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough

(I was fine without ya)

Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation. Well, I tried

(I was fine without ya)

Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer, bad idea
Shout out to what is done?
R.I.P., here comes the sun

(I was fine without ya)

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

// A Girl Like You //

I've never known a girl like you before
Now, just like in a song from days of yore
'Cause here you come a-knocking, knocking on my door
And I've never met a girl like you before

Give me just a taste so I want more
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'Cause now you got me crawling, crawling on the floor
And I've never known a girl like you before

You made me acknowledge the devil in me
I hope to God I'm talking metaphorically
Hope that I'm talking allegorically
Know that I'm talking 'bout the way I feel

And I've never known a girl like you before
Never, never, never, never
Never known a girl like you before

This old town's changed so much
Don't feel like I belong
Too many protest singers
Not enough protest songs
And now you've come along
Yes, you've come along
And I've never met a girl like you before

// Call My Phone Thinking I'm Doing Nothing Better //

[The Streets:]
Call and call my phone, thinking I'm doing nothing better
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can use it again

[Tame Impala:]
I was gonna call you back, I swear
Just as soon as I felt up to it

[The Streets:]
You call and call my phone, thinking I'm doing nothing better
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can get back to it
How funny family is actually fuckin' has you in bits
Your mum has good genes, but Dad's are ripped

Dance like no one is awkward to music listened to lit
You'd worry less about what they thought
If you knew how little they did
On to better things, they fucking love all of the guessing
Someone just met your ex, thinking they met someone special

[Tame Impala:]
I was gonna call you back, I swear
Just as soon as I felt up to it

[The Streets:]
The phone is ringing, the phone is ringing
Can't use it 'til it stops
I moan and listen, the tone emits
The only man in black, hi-viz jackets in the cab
Brexit breakfast, Day-Glo stars, I am baggin' and dashin'
Whoever's with my ex needs to do better
She's still texting me at two 'til ten
Weird liquor tastes weirdly better when your life is fucked up

[Tame Impala:]
I was gonna call you back, I swear
Just as soon as I felt up to it

[The Streets:]
You call and call my phone, thinking I'm doing nothing better
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can use it again
Love isn't a riddle, love isn't made to be hard
You know I'd give you my kidney, just don't ever take my charger

So dance like no one is awkward to music listened to lit
You'd worry less about what they thought
If you knew how little they did
You call and call my phone thinking I'm doing nothing better
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can use it again

[Tame Impala:]
I was gonna call you back, I swear
Just as soon as I felt up to it
It just hasn't happened yet
And I'm still gonna call you back one day
And you can tell me all the news
That you've been trying to, oh yeah

[The Streets (Tame Impala):]
You call and call my phone, thinking I'm doing nothing better
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can use it again
You call and call my phone (I was gonna call you back)
Thinking I'm doing nothing better (I swear)
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can use it again

// Flow //

Well, the air is still but we are moving
I like the wind so wind the windows down

Oh!
See my flow
So we all

And now come back down again
Makes me wonder how I ever felt so good

Oh!
So alone
Feel it all
Flows down
Oh!

I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Wake me when you're done
Let me feel your flow

Feel my flow
Feel at home
Feel alone

// Latenight Moonlight //

Thought of something in the moonlight
What do you think it was?
Thought of something in the moonlight
Forgot it by the morning sun
Whispering the sweeter nothings
Feel you're high above
Now I'm your love

Tell me why you think I love you
And I'll tell you if you're right
Told you all my darkest secrets
But I think I lied

Whispering the sweeter nothings
Feel you're high above
Now I'm your love
[?]

Will I ever find your love?
Tell me before the break of death
I was passing down your fair
Latenight moonlight fades away
Latenight moonlight fades away
Latenight moonlight fades away

// My Life //

Don't tell me
It's all in my mind
In my mind

It's all in my mind

// My Lover Mother Nature //

Outer space is the only place to hide now
From whoever wants to know where you are
Everything is easier than ever
When we fall, baby, we'll fall so
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard

First conferred when the primates tried to warn me
[?] ran off to make a fire
Mother nature whispered to the apes now
We'll rebuild this place when they are
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

I was just another one
Waiting for the bees to come
I was more than nature's son
But I was just another one
Just another one
Oh

// No More Lies //

I'm sorry, girl
Didn't mean to drag you in my dreams
Baby, no more lies
Feeling free
That's the way it's supposed to be
For you and me
You and I both know it's harder than it seems
Love is a two-way street
I'm letting go because the both of us don't need to drive
Baby, it's one at a time

That's just the way it works
Or you and I keep getting hurt
We're going to lose control of the wheel
So put your seatbelt on
I think we're about to crash
In a world of pain
There's so much work to do
So much to unpack
But it's not your fault
I'm just kind of ass

It's looking like I won't be home for another year
Long left undone
'Cause I might just drift on out of here
On the run
I'll just be on my own
I'll just be home alone
My troubles are my own
Unless she wants to come back

I'll just be on my own
I'm dancing on my own
I'll just stay on my own
Unless she wants to come back
Yeah, yeah

As you go out in the world
Don't look back to move forward, there's no time
In our lives
As you know
There's something wrong in your mind (In your mind)
If you think there's no pain in my heart
To say goodbye
Please don't cry
I'm letting go

I'll just be on my own
I'll just stay home alone
My troubles are my own
Unless she wants to come back

I'll just be on my own
I'm dancing on my own
I'll just stay on my own

I mean, my longest relationship was like 7 years
Unless she wants to come back
And she, she was fine
Yeah, yeah
But I need to know what I'm doin' between one to two years with you
Either way it goes
My therapist told me that I should tell you the truth
But you're still angry
So sometimes I still feel like I should have lied
I tell you the truth because I care
But I also lie to you because I care
But if I tell you the truth I guess I can sleep better at night?
But then, it looks like I don't care because I'm telling you the truth
I mean
I guess I'm just not a
Everybody hates when they get to that part when they realise that
I don't wanna tell you I don't care but if it seems like I don't care
It doesn't mean I don't care
It just looks like I don't care
Because my emotions have been sanded off
I live in LA, sweetie, what do you expect?

// Tell Me Where You Are //

From where you're sitting
Tell me where you are
From where you're sitting
Tell me where you are
From where you're sitting
Tell me where you are
From where you're sitting
Tell me where you are
From where you're sitting
Tell me where you are
From where you're sitting
Tell me where you are
From where you're sitting
Tell me where you are

// The Serpentine //

Hold on and I'll think you'll like the day
Cross your heart and hope to fade away
If I was the earth, you'd be the sun, no
You'd be the entire milky way

Deep into the monsters eye
Dancing round the Daddy's thin line
We could go frolic in the meadows
We could go swimming in the serpentine

Hold on you told me you had no
This side of you never show
I wouldn't of wasted all this time
And I'd have you all to my own

Deep into the monsters eye
Dancing round the Daddy's thin line
We could go frolic in the meadows
We could go swimming in the serpentine

Oh, this feeling I've felt before
One of the visions you cannot ignore
I dunno what this feeling is for
I feel the love from you

She said it's kinda like a dream
And I said well honey I have to agree
She said my woes flow like a river
And I said they flow more the sea

// The Sun //

The sun rose on the wrong side of the Earth this morning
Nobody noticed but you
So you winked at the sun
And the sun winked back, and you kept it to yourself
Alright

The stars are gonna give up hope this evening
Nobody knows this but you
When the small ones have imploded
And red giants have supernova'd
Then sorry the Earth will be

The sun rose on the wrong side of the Earth

// Time Warp (And The Day Will Come) //

Sympathy for the fauna
Fragile life in the sauna
In the sea getting warmer
Endlessly 'round the corner
There's no use trying to relate to that older soul
And no use trying to debate that they've got it wrong
There's no use pining for love when you're on your own
And no use crying outside if nobody's home
There's no use flying to the moon if they won't believe
So why do I go wrong on repeat?

(And the day will come)
(And then it will pass)
(And then it will pass)

I was blinded by a memory, like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll learnin' fast
And the day will come and then it will pass
I taught you wrong when I say I won't
And though I try, I do the same as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust

(And the day will come)
(And then it will pass)
(And then it will pass)

Sympathy for the fauna
Fragile life in the sauna
In the sea getting warmer
Endlessly 'round the corner
And though I try, I do the same as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust...

// Turn Up The Sunshine //

(Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine
Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine
Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine
Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine)

We can make it further, we running and don't look back
It's a light at the end of the tunnel if you stay on track
But I know any minute when your fingers turn it up like snap
So hard to lose like that (Hey)

Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it
All the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine, you gotta turn up the sunshine
Said it's been a long night, a long night
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that

You want it, you got it, I'm with it if you do it like that
It's brighter now when the colors of the rainbow flash
We gotta keep it moving, make a change so it don't change back
So hard to lose like that

Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it
All the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine, you gotta turn up the sunshine
Said it's been a long night, a long night
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that

If this weather makes you frown
And some people get you down, remember
Love like sound, it's better when it's loud
And if there's no song inside
We can bring the light together
Day or night, we're shining from inside

Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine

Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine

Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine

Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine

All around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it
All the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine, you gotta turn up the sunshine
Said it's been a long night, a long night
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that

// Wings Of Time //

We are number one, it is clear to us now
All that's said and done
I knew it all along and the world will find out
Oh, it takes time, to love

Do you see the wings of time?
Do you feel a sense of pride now?
Do you know you'll never fly alone?
We did it right this time

I know I came on strong, I was just excited
You might come along, with us
Now we're going home to the old horizon
To love, live, fall, survive

Do you see the wings of time?
Do you feel a sense of pride now?
Do you know you'll never fly alone?
We did it right this time
We did it right this time
We did it right this time
We did it right this time
We did it right this time
We did it right this time
