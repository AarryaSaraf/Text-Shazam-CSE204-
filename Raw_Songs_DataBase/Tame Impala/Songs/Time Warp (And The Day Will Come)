Sympathy for the fauna
Fragile life in the sauna
In the sea getting warmer
Endlessly 'round the corner
There's no use trying to relate to that older soul
And no use trying to debate that they've got it wrong
There's no use pining for love when you're on your own
And no use crying outside if nobody's home
There's no use flying to the moon if they won't believe
So why do I go wrong on repeat?

(And the day will come)
(And then it will pass)
(And then it will pass)

I was blinded by a memory, like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll learnin' fast
And the day will come and then it will pass
I taught you wrong when I say I won't
And though I try, I do the same as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust

(And the day will come)
(And then it will pass)
(And then it will pass)

Sympathy for the fauna
Fragile life in the sauna
In the sea getting warmer
Endlessly 'round the corner
And though I try, I do the same as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust...
