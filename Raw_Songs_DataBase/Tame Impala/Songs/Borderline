Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know?
How was I to know this dark emotion?

We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
Asking how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
(If you and I get comfortable)

We're on the borderline 
(On the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time 
(Then I saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Is there room, room for doubt?
As within, as without you

Will I be so in love?
Getting closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done?
R.I.P., here comes the sun

Here comes the sun

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with somethin'
How could I have known?
How was I to know this life get no shame?

I said, "Come with me outside
I need to clear my mind
This weight is crashing
Do you see the light
Oh, coming from their eyes?
Oh, no.
And I couldn't get away."

We're on the borderline
Gets me every time
These close encounters
Just to know I can
(Just to know I can)
Once again I am alone

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough

(I was fine without ya)

Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation. Well, I tried

(I was fine without ya)

Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer, bad idea
Shout out to what is done?
R.I.P., here comes the sun

(I was fine without ya)

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
