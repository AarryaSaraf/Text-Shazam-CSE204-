Thought of something in the moonlight
What do you think it was?
Thought of something in the moonlight
Forgot it by the morning sun
Whispering the sweeter nothings
Feel you're high above
Now I'm your love

Tell me why you think I love you
And I'll tell you if you're right
Told you all my darkest secrets
But I think I lied

Whispering the sweeter nothings
Feel you're high above
Now I'm your love


Will I ever find your love?
Tell me before the break of death
I was passing down your fair
Latenight moonlight fades away
Latenight moonlight fades away
Latenight moonlight fades away
