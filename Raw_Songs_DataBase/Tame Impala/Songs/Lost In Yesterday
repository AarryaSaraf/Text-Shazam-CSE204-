When we were living in squalor,
Wasn't it heaven?
Back when we used to get on it
Four outta seven

Now even though that was a time I
Hated from day one
Eventually, terrible memories
Turn into great ones

So if they call you
Embrace them
If they hold you
Erase them

'Cause it might have been something, who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you mighta missed something, don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been digging it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might have been something, don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday

Matty said life didn't go the
Way that he planned it
Said, "Oh, what I'd give to start over
Boy, I'd command it"

So what was I ever afraid of,
Why did I worry?
And why was I ever so brainless?
Head in a flurry

'Cause if they call you
Embrace them
If they stall you
Erase them

'Cause it might have been something, who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you mighta missed something, don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been digging it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might have been something, don't say
'Cause it has to stay lost in yesterday

So if it calls you
Embrace it
If it haunts you
Face it

I know it's mad
I understand
It's only snakes
And ladders
The period
You never had
There's only one
That matters

And if it calls you
Embrace it
If it holds you
Erase it (replace it)
