We are number one, it is clear to us now
All that's said and done
I knew it all along and the world will find out
Oh, it takes time, to love

Do you see the wings of time?
Do you feel a sense of pride now?
Do you know you'll never fly alone?
We did it right this time

I know I came on strong, I was just excited
You might come along, with us
Now we're going home to the old horizon
To love, live, fall, survive

Do you see the wings of time?
Do you feel a sense of pride now?
Do you know you'll never fly alone?
We did it right this time
We did it right this time
We did it right this time
We did it right this time
We did it right this time
We did it right this time
