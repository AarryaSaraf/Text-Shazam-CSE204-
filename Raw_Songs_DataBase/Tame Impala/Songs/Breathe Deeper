If you think I couldn't hold my own
Believe me I can believe me I can believe me I can
If it ain't so awful and we're all together
I can believe me I can believe me I can
If you think I couldn't owe it up
Believe me I can believe me I can believe me I can
If ideally we should feel like this forever
I can believe me I can believe me I can

Would you say seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
Would you say now you're having fun?
So do this and get through this and come find me when you're done
So we can be as one

If you think I couldn't hold my own
Believe me I can believe me I can believe me I can
If you need someone to tell you that you're special
I can believe me I can believe me I can
If you need someone to carry on
Believe me I can believe me I can believe me I can
If you think that I was feeling what you're feeling, 
I am believe me I am believe me I am

And the groove is low

Would you say seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this 
(And the groove is low)
And come find me when you're done
So we can be as one

'Til the mornin'
'Til the mornin'
Oh
And the groove is low
'Til the mornin'
And the groove is low

Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper should you need to come undone
('Til the mornin')
And let those colors run
Now you're having fun
('Til the mornin')
Do this and get through this and until we see the sun
(And the groove is low)
You're my number one

'Til the mornin'
(Would you say?)
And the groove is low
'Til the mornin'
And the groove is low

We're both adults
But we behave like children
Long as we got
Enough to keep on living

'Til the mornin'
'Til the mornin'
