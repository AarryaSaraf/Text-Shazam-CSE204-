Said the voice from afar, don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?
Waiting for everyone else around to agree
Might take too long, might take too long
When it won't be so hard (it won't be so hard)
Well it's true, yes but you won't get far telling me

That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do, oh alter ego

Get them to love you while they may depending on your words and wealth
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Nobody else, nobody else
If I could part it wouldn't be so hard (it wouldn't be so hard)
Well it's true, yes but you won't get far telling me

That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do, oh alter ego
