Many ways to go
It's hard to self-assure
When everyone's a pro
Sayin', "It's so obvious,"
But really they don't know
(They don't know, they don't know shit)
Just like a monster that is only a shadow (A shadow)
From which I'm already runnin'

Easy, I suppose
And even if it takes a hundred-thousand goes
The way's in front of me 'cause that's the one I chose (I chose)
It's always starin' at you (Barely a choice)
That's the boat I row (I row)
And though it seems to be

Endless
Problems, relentless
I know I'm oblivious
Bit overzealous
And possibly jealous
I run 'til I'm breathless
Try to suppress it
I couldn't bear it, so onward I go
