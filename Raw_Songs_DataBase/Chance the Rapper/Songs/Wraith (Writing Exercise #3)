My name like the Rangers, I write in Stone
Chano my nigga, he right or he wrong
Stars in the roof it's a, aye, yeah
It's a war zone at home
Aye, this shit don't make no sense
Pullin' up in that spaceship, yeah

My name like the Rangers, I write in Stone
Chano my nigga, he right or he wrong
Stars in the roof it's a it's a war zone at home
I swear this shit feel like Attack of the Clones
Father them niggas, I gave 'em they sound
It might've worked out if I wrote 'em they songs
One of one Kerby, I got this sown
My fist in the air like the back of my comb
Over they head like a shot with a drone
Securus calls puttin' money on phone
Mom ask me when I'm coming back home
I said I'd be down, a benefit to you to have me around
This rap shit got slow went and got me a pound, that Towkio grown
TMZsocio, why they so nosy though?
These niggas lyin' I call 'em Pinocchio, aye
You know this ain't my first rodeo
He caught two shots, I call that shit a doppio
My niggas poppin', so don't try the oki-doke
They with the six, they ain't on OVO
I'm on the 5 gettin' Peso with Curry Moe
Yeah, you know my story though


Pick up the pace if I pick up the phone
She acting up, I start actin' along
Wake up one morning and that bitch gone
We not in Kansas, Patrick Mahomes
Over the rainbow and back in the two flat, the witches is too flat
They shattered bones
The house is too heavy
The wrist is too heavy
My brother a heavy
He stackin' the Stone
Savemoney marrow it's back in my bones
I'm back in the 'Yo like it's back in the day
My city a riot I go on a diet
But if I keep eating they'll have a parade
I'm on the 9 I'm having a Wraith
If I got the Bentley we havin' a race
I'm slammin' the jakes and stackin' the rakes
We going in prisons and openin' gates
Closing the precinct and open the case
I'm cracking the code, open the safe
My brothers my sisters I sat and thought
And flew in a rush and soaked in lake
People scattered the leaders was flattered
And hidden in neo-colonial states
You cannot get out this by owning a school
You cannot get out this by owning the place
Body the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the head
I'm part of the body, I'm part of the problem
I'm a part of my body
I'm parting the red
Body the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the head
The sea get too choppy
The people get wocky and Israel's salty the water is dead


Bob Marley, I'm burnin'
Bob Marley, I'm burnin'
Got me ballin' like Irving
And the world keep turnin'
In a suburban, I'm swervin'
And she slurpin' the bourbon
And I'm smokin' on Durbin
And my motor a German
Bob Marley, I'm burnin'
Bob Marley, I'm burnin'
Got me ballin' like Irving
And the world keep turnin'
In a suburban, I'm swervin'
And she slurpin' the bourbon
And I'm smokin' on Durbin
And my motor a German
