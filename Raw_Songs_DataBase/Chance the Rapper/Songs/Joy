Christmas, this Christmas, is a time for joy
(There's a time for joy, there's a time for joy)
When Jesus, was a little boy (When Jesus, was a little boy)
(He was a little boy, was a little boy)
They tend to forget about love
(Forget all about love, forget all about love)
Let's get right back to joy
(Get right back to joy, get right back to joy, get right back to joy)

Baby, let's light up the Christmas tree
Spike the eggnog with the Hennessy
Spread the love that heat the coldest winter
Jingle Bells is all I could remember
'Tis the season we should spread the cheer
Christmas caroling, door-to-door
Can't forget just what we do this for
When can we can get back to the joy?

Got some hot chocolate for you, baby
Silent nights, just hit me up
Can't tell me that you not my angel
We should make snow angel doves
Outside, lookin' Christmas and you just who I'm thinkin' of
Favorite time of year, why can't you feel the love?

Christmas, this Christmas, is a time for joy
(There's a time for joy, there's a time for joy, there's a time for joy)
When Jesus, was a little boy (When Jesus was a little boy)
(He was a little boy, he was, was a little boy)
They tend to forget about love
(Forget all about love, forget all about love)
Let's get right back to joy
(Let's get, get right back to joy)
(Bundle of joy)

Why y'all always arguing and carrying on?
Christmas was meant for sharing a bond
Google "Chicago Bettie Jones", them kids buried their mom
Sometimes I dream of moving a spot where cops carry batons
So I could visit with jet lag, lose all my checked bags
To wake up in my old room with beauties from Jet Mag
I hate when y'all talk about bail money
Who go to jail for me and who tryna steal from me?
I got that Sister Carolyn Jenkins KOK covenant love
I'm covered at the door, the cover's the blood
Bungalow Jungle that housed a thousand fistfights that humble my buds
Couple birds that make me wonder what was
Won't let the lawyers destroy us
The Pontius Pilates judge my bundle of joys
I know my bronze is gorgeous
Know who the birthday boy is
I'm on my 773 love
Weaponized free love, 7979 (7777)

Christmas, this Christmas, is a time for joy
(There's a time for joy, there's a time for joy, joy, joy)
When Jesus, was a little boy (Little baby boy)
(He was a little boy, was a little boy, he was)
They tend to forget about love (They tend to forget all about love, forget all about love, love, love)
Let's get right back to joy (Joy, joy)
(Get right back to joy, get right back to joy)
Joy
