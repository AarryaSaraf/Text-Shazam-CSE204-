Woo
God's creation
No filters, no imitation
Observations, consistent, you're amazin'
So fine, wishin' that you were mine, but that I'm quite patient
It's so divine, intelligent conversations
Stimulatin' your mind, where's my invitation?
I'd kill for the time to stop the clock
Pull up to your block, in a drop, would love your cooperation
Reserved a place in my heart, and I'm handlin' all accommodations
I'm so floored, you should win an award, for best spirit
I'm hearin' you got all my nominations, all in moderation
Takin' it slow but my mind racin', loosin' all my concentration
I'm spaced out but I'm readin' the signs
And when the stars align, you're my beautiful constellation


Ayy
So soft, so soft to the touch
Type love that cause fools to rush
Type love that comes in the clutch
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I learned it's all by design
So delicate, so fine (So fine)
I was lost but you brought me right back
I just fell in your lap, I had to follow the map
Then I found you


Ha, beautiful creature
Complex, over achiever
Nice to meet you, my antenna's tryna receive you
Your action, you're the special attraction
Lovin' all of your features
Get the picture?
Proverbs, 33:4, I'm caught in the scriptures
I found the fountain of youth, and you're the elixir
It's the truth and I promise to never mislead
One of the millions of fan in your arena
If you was a song then I would stream ya
If you was a novel then I would read ya
Over and over, what's the procedure to please ya?
Ha, you such a diva
Woman of my dream, I'm such a believer
My heart's tryna get in touch, let me reach you
I got food for your soul, let me feed you


Ayy
So soft, so soft to the touch
Type love that cause fools to rush
Type love that comes in the clutch
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I learned it's all by design
So delicate, so fine (So fine)
I was lost but you brought me right back
I just fell in your lap, I had to follow the map
Then I found you

Hey yeah, hey yeah
Found you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I learned it's all by design
So delicate, so fine (So fine)
I was lost but you brought me right back
I just fell in your lap, I had to follow the map
Then I found you
