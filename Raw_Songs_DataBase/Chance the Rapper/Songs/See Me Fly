Pull the ground from out under me if you want to see me fly

Where I'm from, you learn to walk rocking ankle weights
The dirt road for us ran about his ankle brace
Was getting chased down block for a bunch of reasons
If you was learning how to fly, then it was hunting season
And if you learning how to try, then it was try and cheat them
My momma seen it, said, "Boy, you better" (And I'm gonna take this shot)
You ain't gotta knock 'em out before you gotta beat them (Risk it all against the fall)
You better look at every shot like it's your shot at freedom
Now fast forward, the kid is the king
Championship so big the box fit in the ring
They make 'em fantasize match ups who could in his prime
I could shoot from the logo with my foot on the line
That mean my shoes too big to fill
Future on free bands, my presence on the court like my past keep replaying
My wingspan longer than the message at the bottom of CSPAN
Just a kid who played Heat fans and Cleveland for real

Pull the ground from out under me if you want to see me fly
Look at the sky up where the clouds at
The air up here is so clear we clearly on top
From out under me if you want to see me fly
We built this thing from where the ground's at
It's our time to take flight we're cleared for take off
From out under me if you want to see me fly

Yeah, it's game time now, we gotta jump it like the tip off
Whole city been waiting on me prepare for lift off
Never cheat the process there's some you can't rip off
Made it through the struggle and prosper through every pitfall
I can't sleep, walked in with game seven energy
The gang three, I come from the Bay, boy, I killin' it no more game

And I'm gonna take this shot, risk it all against the fall
If they can't hold me, can't block me
I'm up on this nonstop
Not earthbound, no, can't lift it, love, silk shot, yeah, no limit
Yeah, if they can't hold me, can't block me
I'm not stoppin', no
You can try to keep me down
Pull the ground out from me now if you want to see me fly

Pull the ground from out under me if you want to see me fly
Look at the sky up where the clouds at
The air up here is so clear we clearly on top
From out under me if you want to see me fly
We built this thing from where the ground's at
It's our time to take flight we're cleared for take off
From out under me if you want to see me fly
