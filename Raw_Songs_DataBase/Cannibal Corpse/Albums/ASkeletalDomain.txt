// High Velocity Impact Spatter //

Climbing
Heights unimagined unattained
To drop bodies from the sky
Falling
Alive in mid air moving fast
Heads exploding on the ground
Throwing
Corrupted souls in front of trains
Just to watch the bodies fly
Grinning
At the site of shredded innards
Brains exploded all around.

High velocity impact spatter.

Slamming
You into walls excesive speed
Creates catastrophic sounds
Scraping
Fresh blood and guts from off the pavement
Before stench of death sets in
Piercing
Between the eyes and unexpected
Liquid red spraying behind
Killing
Impact spatter brutal force
Something I will always need.

High velocity impact spatter.

A necro potion is made
From the remains of the dead

[lead - O´Brien]

Daily ritual intake
Drinking remains of the dead.

[lead - O´Brien]

Death after life after death
Only obtained in one way.

// Sadistic Embodiment //

A sharpend sense of supreme evil
Triggered in the mind
A gruesome transformation of the body
And the soul
A dreaded life of worthlessness
Now has a new meaning
Wreak havoc like a vile wretch
Possessed until the end

Anger
Released
Torture
Returning

Sadistic embodiment
Sadistic embodiment

Spreading the corruption
Flowing is destruction
To obliterate all that is good this world

A sharpened knife to butcher people
Sitting in the hand
For gruesome transformations of
The body and the soul
There dreaded lives of worthlessness
Will have a new meaning
Wreak havoc on a vile wretch
Dissected until dead

Anger
Released
Torture
Returning

You were in the way

The mutilation leads to death
Existence now irrelevant
Never will be in the way again

// Kill Or Become //

Viral contagion unleashed upon the earth
Billions of infected dead soon rise
Stalking the living to feast upon the flesh
Its fight or flee to survive

Living out the days and nights in absolute fear
Never knowing when and where the
threat of the undead draws near
Toughts of those left behind
Are slowly tormenting your mind

Killing is essential to survive
The world you once knew forever changed
Scavenging just to stay alive
Time to release your inner rage

Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off

If you want to live you have to kill or become
There´s no other way you have to kill or become
If you want to live you have to kill or become
There´s no other way you have to kill or become

Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off

Viral contagion unleashed upon the earth
Billions of infected dead soon rise
Stalking the living to feast upon the flesh
Its fight or flee to survive

Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off

Hack their fucking heads off

If you want to live you have to kill or become
There´s no other way you have to kill or become
If you want to live you have to kill or become
There´s no other way you have to kill or become

Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off

// A Skeletal Domain //

Trapped beneath rotting remains
A slow decay of life takes its form

Withered death and bone emerge
From cemeteries of the earth
Replacing all that is known from this world

Towering structures take shape
As more cities are laid to waste

Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new

Misshapen and half mutilated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew

Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign

A new society takes place
Where the way of the cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain

A kingdom of the damned

Carnal war consuming them by
Eating flesh for nourishment
Solution for a short-term survival

Slaughtered are the weakest first
Feeding those with evil thirst
As blood of the dead saturates the ground

Again the end has begun
Another kingdom will be damned

Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new

Misshapen and half mutilated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew

Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign

A new society takes place
Where the way of the cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain

// Headlong Into Carnage //

No hesitation as the bloodshed begins
Frenzied violence, raging death
Devastation as the killers
Savagely murder all in sight

Mutilators swarming hacking off limbs
Falling bodies, severed heads
Pure destruction by the mob
Butchering all that they can see

Honing their insanity
Headlong into carnage without fear
Ruthless human weapons with no conscience, unaware

Rampaging killers slash with furious hate
Bones are breaking, blood is spilled
Mutilation feeds their hunger
Brutally killing satisfies
Relentless slaughter innards hang from their blades

Disembowelment, of their prey
In the bloodbath all their vile
Dreams will come to pass

Weaponized psychopathy
Headlong into carnage seeking blood
Seething minds distorted by the violence and pain

Driven by adrenaline
Headlong into carnage they attack
Merciless and brutal take the head off of your neck

Sweat flies while throats are cut
Tendons snapping, sinew tearing
Blood pours from gaping wounds
Sadistic chaos, grips you.

Bones crack from heavy blows
Fractured cheekbones, shattered skull
Bludgeoning without remorse
Eyes bulge and spurt out blood.

[Lead - O´Brien, Barrett, O´Brien, Barrett]

Extensive killing many thousands have died
Bodies rotten, stench of death
Desolation as the killers
Scavenge the corpses of the slain

Insane desire, killing cannot end
Psychotic evil, mania
Stimulation by the blood
Searching for people they can kill

Weaponized psychopathy
Headlong into carnage seeking blood
Seething minds distorted by the violence and pain

Driven by adrenaline
Headlong into carnage they attack
Merciless and brutal take the head off of your neck

// The Murderer's Pact //

Coercion and threats
Made their demands
Held the past over my head
One mistake has made me their tool
Blackmailing a means to the end, I'm forced into the pact

Murderer
Is that what I am?

Homicide
How can I stop this?

Not a violent man but now I'm forced to kill
Seems to be no other way
Trapped by an accident, tragic and fatal
The crime was unintentional, but this I cannot prove

Murderer
Is there no way out?

Suicide
Is that the answer?

Desperation
Deal has been made
No turning back
I'm bound to kill by the murderer's pact

Steel myself fot the task at hand
Preparing the tools that I need
Sharpen the blades, make the kill quick
Extortion drove me to the deed, I take from it no joy

Murderer
Now I will do this

Homicide
I have made my choice

Sins of the past
Haunt me today
Should have confessed

Motive concealed
Undetected
Hunting him down
His life will end
I'm bound to kill by the murderer's pact

Thrust of the blade repulses
Commit the heinous crime
Stabbing him repeatedly
Gouge his neck, slash his face

See his look of terror
He knows his time has come
Cannot show him mercy
Make him die, finish it

[Lead - O'Brien]

Blood on the knife
His body slumps
Corpse left to rot
The deed is done

But in my mind
There is no peace
Two dark secrets
That I must keep
I'm bound to kill by the murderer's pact

// Funeral Cremation //

Stand before the corpse
Of the man I killed
His mother is behind me
Puts her hand on my shoulder
Torment deep inside
To be unleashed on those inside
Starting with this bitch
I grab her arm and smash
Her body on her lifeless son

A day of mourning fuels annihilation
I will kill them all by funeral cremation

Relatives must die
Of the man I killed
One by one destroyed
Nothing left when it is over
Torment deep inside
To be unleashed on those inside
Ending with his kids
Blood is flowing from their bodies
Out of misery

Out of their misery
In with my cruelty
Erase the present
To forget the past
Chaotic fury
Was driven by feat
Fear so intense
My whole family was slaughtered by me

[lead - O´Brien]

// Vector Of Cruelty //

Inborn, lack of conscience
I think but cannot feel
Affectations
Manipulations
Victims bend to my will

Passed through generations
Murderous ways
Proclivity for violence
No remorse of shame

Murder, a fascination
Dispatching those who trust
My compulsion

Fleeting fulfillment
No joywill ever last

The soulless walk among you
Concealed by deceit
Smiling when I face you
Slashing when I turn

This vector of cruelty
Denied me a soul
Genetic mutation
Driving me

Your pleas cannot move me
No mercy to give
I seek domination
A master of pain

This vector of cruelty
Emotionless, cold
No human connection
Weaking

Cold-blooded and willful
I slaughtered them all
They thought I'd protect them
But I made them die

Legacy, abnormality
The ladder twists, and the rungs are broken
Impregnate, and the vector spreads

Momentum shifts, and I start controlling
Parasite, of morality
Malevolent, eyes are empty
Merciless, I cannot care

This vector of cruelty
Denied me a soul
Genetic mutation driving me

Your pleas cannot move me
No mercy to give
I seek domination
A master of pain

This vector of cruelty
Emotionless, cold
No human connection
Weaking

Cold-blooded and willful
I slaughtered them all
They thought I'd protect them
But I made them die

// Bloodstained Cement //

Stalking his prey
He prepares for the ambush
I hear his steps
But without trepidation
Hyper aware
I will strike back

When he brandished the blade
Gave his intentions away

Back to the wall, I have no choice
It's time to fight or die
I will respond with overwhelming force
A switch turns on and I must survive

Fearless resolve
As I spring into action

Quickly disarm
And remove his advantage
Only one thing on my mind
Stop his attack

Now he's on the defense
Momentum is shifting my way

A savage brawl, I hear his voice
Pure terror in his cries
Break his balance, slam him to the ground
Following through to stay alive

Landing multiple bowls
The blood is starting to spray

Will not stop till I am sure
The threat has been put down
Raining with forearm thrusts
Torrents of blood flow from his eyes
Bloodstained cement

No weakness to exploit
His ambush failed
Hammer fists break facial bones
Knuckles bleed from shards of teeth

Smash his skull onto pavement
Make the bastard pay
Don't stop until it cracks
And spills out his brain

Bloodstained cement

When he chose me as prey
A fatal mistake was made

// Asphyxiate To Resuscitate //

Always the same
Killing for years
You have died and
I brought you back
While you see the dark
I see the light
A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be

Choking
Starling
Breathless
Asphyxiate
Lifeless
Gasping
Breathing
Resuscitate

A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be
A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be

// Hollowed Bodies //

Putrid mess lays in the woods
Removed of organs and meat
13 mounds of bony flesh
Hollowed out expect for maggots
That dwell
Deep inside the skulls
Of victims that they cleaned
How did this horror unfold

No trace of evidence was left behind
At this scene of gore
Will the truth ever be told

Only time will tell

Will there be more to find
Some more hollowed bodies
Will there be more to find some more hollowed bodies
With their untold stories

Cadavers rot
Cadavers rot hollowed

13 more corpses are found
13 miles exactly south
26 more to the north
2 stacks of 13 humans
13 miles apart from one another
In a line
Why did this horror unfold

2 more
1 to the west
1 to the east make 6 in total
Will the truth ever be told

Only if I tell

Will there be more to find
Some more hollowed bodies
Will there be more to find some more hollowed bodies
With their untold stories

Cadavers rot
Cadavers rot hollowed

Bodies were found
Hollowed bodies
Bodies were found
Hollowed bodies
