Album: Torture

// Demented Aggression //

Pain is my reward from psychotic tendencies
Pain I give to you
Pain relentlessly
Torturing has reached a level no one's ever seen
Suffer for your life
Rabid force extreme
Rage is my obsession driven by my cruelty
Rage is my release
Rage relentlessly
Ravaging continues through my scattered lunacy
Malice for your life
Rapid force extreme

Demented aggression

Hate is the reason I embrace these fantasies
Hate engulfs my mind
Hate relentlessly
With pain and rage and hatred relentlessly

With pain
Rage and hate
Beatings come faster
Beatings last longer
With pain
Rage and hate
Beatings are forever
I don't think you'll live [2x]

Don't think you'll live
Don't think you'll live
I don't think you'll live

Pain is my reward from psychotic tendencies
Rage is my release
Hate relentlessly
With pain and rage and hatred relentlessly

With pain
Rage and hate
Torture coming faster
Torture lasting longer
With pain
Rage and hate
Torture is forever
I don't think you'll live [2x]

Don't think you'll live
Don't think you'll live
I don't think you'll live

Left as a pummeled mound of waste
Rot and decay under the sun

[Solo: O'Brien]

With pain
Rage and hate
Suffering is faster
Suffering is longer
With pain
Rage and hate
Suffering is forever
I don't think you'll live [2x]

// Sarcophagic Frenzy //

Here they come
No chance of stopping them now
Trudging forward
On a quest - for human flesh
Panic is a catalyst
They crave limbs - to rip and twist
Now soon to be within - their grasp

Run - the chase begins
Terror - they're closing in
Must attempt to refrain from defeat
Done - fallen to the ground
Clawing - disturbing sounds
Can't escape the gnashing of their teeth

Tearing off the outer skin to invade the inside
Sanguinary mastication now the pain is increased
Slashing of the arteries, completely defiled
Bleeding out and soon to rot - carrion feast

They cannot stop the craving for more blood!!! [2x]

Attacking with no sign of remorse
Nothing can stop this showing of force
A virulent onslaught - rotten, decayed
As they continue to feed on the corpse

[Solo: Barrett]

Attacking with no sign of remorse
Nothing can stop this showing of force
A virulent onslaught - rotten, decayed
As they continue to feed on the corpse

Onward - to feed
Never will the cycle end
Only bones are left behind
Cannot stop this craving for more blood!!! [2x]

// Scourge Of Iron //

In thrall to the evil lord
A procession of the damned
Sweating blood to serve the beast
Desolation of their souls

They slave in fire
Whips of Hades at their backs
The Scourge of Iron
Hell's eternal pact

Lash them
Rip their skin
Scourge of Iron
Rending flesh

On earth they lived by force
Now the villains march in chains
Men of violence doomed in death
Their reward for a life of sin

They slave for eons
There will be no relief
Mere pawns of evil
Used and then enslaved

Lash them
Rip their skin
Scourge of Iron
Rending flesh

Lash
Rip their skin
Scourge of Iron
Rending flesh

Demonic sadists
Flay the damned with steel
The whip strips flesh

Torments beyond the material world
skinless, bleeding
Robbed of pride and power

In the grip of the infernal
And the evil will not die
Iron whip will be relentless
And the pain will never end

[Solo: O'Brien]

Lash them
Rip their skin
Scourge of Iron
Rending flesh

Lash
Rip their skin
Scourge of Iron
Rending flesh

// Encased In Concrete //

Bound blindfolded
Thickened liquid soaks my feet it's rising upward
Shrieks of panic
Hardened liquid traps my feet insanity is closer

I don't want to die
No one hears my cries
Liquid to my knees
Encased in concrete
Come to realize
My life won't last long
Hardened to my knees
Encased in concrete

Can't break free immobilized
Thinning air asphyxiates
Won't cling on to life much longer
Almost over

Almost covered
Thickened liquid to my chest it's rising upward
Silent panic
Hardened liquid to my chest insanity is here

Gag
A tube is forced down my throat to breathe
Air
Convulsions from the oxygen intake
Lungs
Are barely expanding slow suffocation
Choke
Ice cold cement is poured over my head

Massive pressure as it sets
Never to be seen again
Won't cling on to life much longer
Almost over

Wanted to survive
No one heard my cries
Liquid transforming
Encased in concrete
Come to realize My life won't last long
Shrouding my body
Encased in concrete

Encased in concrete [3x]

// As Deep As The Knife Will Go //

The blade goes in you and it enters smooth
Disturbing moans begin to soothe
Scraping bone with steel to feel it once
Keep pushing hard it never stops

Had to do it
Had to put it in your gut
Nothing to it
Grab the handle let it slice

Heart polluted
As it's cut out of your chest
Gushing fluids
Bleeding it dry

As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go

As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go

The blade has always done its job well
Seems like its work is never done
Scraping bone with steel to feel it twice
Keep pushing hard it doesn't stop

Desecrated
A body rid of living
Future faded
Gaping hole from front to back

Heart dissected
As it sits upon your chest
Gushing fluids
Drain you empty

As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go

As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go

Bleed it dry
Bleed it dry
Drain you empty
Drain you empty [2x]

[Solo: O'Brien]

As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go

As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go

// Intestinal Crank //

Butchers drag me to the rack
Bind my hands to the bar
Legs are fastened to the table
Hooded man unsheathes his knife

Incisions will be made
Blood drips from the blade
Visceral display

Hook attached inside
Cavity gaping wide
Soon I will die

Intestinal crank

Merciless, they turn the crank
Interrogation has begun
Awake I'm being disemboweled
Rotation pulling out the guts

Excruciating pain
Body starts to strain
Struggle in vain

Tortured by this tool
Intestines on the spool
Barbarous cruelty

Intestinal crank
Intestinal crank

Winding
Innards

And the crank will turn
And the crank will turn

Turning
Pulling

Unremitting pain
Turn the crank again

Twisting
Coiling

Drawing out the guts
Drawing out the guts

The rack
Stretching

Snapping cartilage
Dislocate joints

Writhing
Broken

I will die in pain
I will die in pain

Torment 
Endless

Disemboweled alive
Disemboweled alive

[Solo: O'Brien]

Intestinal Crank

// Followed Home Then Killed //

Creeping in the shadows
Shadows of the night
Wading through the darkness
A death before the light
Blending in with faces
Faces of the night
Safe at home in comfort
At home is where you'll die

Watching you
Knowing your every move
Hearing you
Every single word that you spew
Carving you
Is what I'm about to do
Saving you
From the torment of this earth to be buried for rebirth

Silently I enter through the broken basement window now to wait
It's twelve o'clock the time has come ascend the staircase to the hunted one
Make way to the second floor right outside your open bedroom door
One last time to sleep in peace unaware of brutal things that

Will be done
To you after you awake
Enter slow
Machete leads the way
Eerie calm
Death is in the air
Savage thrust
Death is everywhere

Adrenaline is pumping as my heart is pounding faster yours slows down
Choke on blood and breathe your last breath mangled
guts I wear to celebrate
Stay inside and fuck the corpse an innards orgy satisfies my needs
Finally I feel complete by eating brains and flesh

Followed home then killed
Sacrificed in vain
Followed home then killed
I stalked you for years
Followed home then killed

[Solo: O'Brien]

Take what's left in garbage bags and throw them in a hole I dug out back
Clean the room I killed you in making sure the clues of sin are gone
Revel in my vicious deed and replay what had happened in my head
Vivid memories of you remain of your remains

Followed home then killed
Sacrificed in vain
Followed home then killed
I stalked you for years
Followed home then killed

Followed home then killed

// The Strangulation Chair //

Trapped in this prison awaiting my death
Condemned to die by draconian means
An eye for an eye is the rule of this land
But the victim in question did not die by my

Hand
A mockery of justice
Inequity
The murderer will live but I will die

Strapped to a chair unable to breathe
Other condemned have died before me
Constrained in the chair I saw fear in their eyes
The executioner smiled as he took their

Lives
Crushing their windpipes
Garroted
Throttled with iron they succumb to death

The Strangulation Chair
Constriction of the throat
No air for the lungs, no blood for the brain

A death I don't deserve
Blameless of this crime
Only I know this is true

The Strangulation Chair
The spinal column breaks
Then my life will cease, my final release

A death I have not earned
But still have to face
They are the murderers now

My day has come now it's my turn to die
Hands tied they lead me away
The executioner collars my neck
In terror I wait for my strangulation
my strangulation, my strangulation

[Solo: O'Brien]

Death
My mind slips to darkness
Unconscious forever
The crime they committed they will not know

The Strangulation Chair
Constriction of the throat
No air for the lungs, no blood for the brain

A death I don't deserve
Blameless of this crime
Only I know this is true

The Strangulation Chair
The spinal column breaks
Then my life will cease, my final release

A death I have not earned
But still have to face
They are the murderers now

// Caged... Contorted //

Abducted by a psychopath with evil intent
Beaten to the point of unconsciousness
Awakened by the sound of someone screaming in pain...

Realizing now that you are trapped in a cage
Arms and legs in disarray
Bones have all been broken and your limbs are displaced
Body in a horrible state
Unbearable effluvium polluting the air
A nauseating stench of death
Maggots are all over on the walls and the floor
Patiently awaiting for - your flesh...

Numerous victims litter the room
You are not the only one
Various forms of torture
Profaned existence for you all

Strapped to tables - chained to the walls
Fingers are reaching out between floorboards
Others are floating in the air held up by hooks
Drained of their lives...

Caged...Contorted [2x]

[Solo: Barrett]

Realizing now that you will die in this place
Emaciating skin awaits
For the maggots that will crawl onto your body and face
The final phase of your demise...

Paralyzing agony has left you for dead
The psychopath returns to finish the task
Dying to the sound of others creaming in pain...

Caged... Contorted [2x]

// Crucifier Avenged //

Crucifixion, peasants bound to the cross
Heartless judgement, tyrannical laws
Among the jurists pangs of conscience arise
Conspiracy begins, the crucifier must fall

Assassination was attempted but failed
The conspirators are captured and jailed
Enraged by the plot now he vows his revenge
Hunt them down, seek their death, merciless

Collaborators face a summary trial
They are guilty there can be no denial
Convicted plotters face the hammer and nail
The traitors will be punished, the traitors will die

Their compunction, a sentence of death
Thoughts of mercy are replaced by dread
Punishment for traitors, swift and severe
Kill them all, they will die, crucify

Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell

Punctured by piercing, the beam dripping blood
As a deterrent they are left there for months
Their agonizing deaths will serve to warn the rest
Betrayers will be hunted, betrayers will die

Wretched traitors, sun cooking their flesh
Rotting slowly they're begging for death
Transfixed by iron only bones will remain
He will hunt, hell's pursuit, execute

Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell

No remorse for their deaths
No one will be spared from this fate
Hammer spikes through their hands
Penetrate the soles of their feet

Plant the stakes in the ground
Raise the crosses of the condemned
Proclaim judgement with blood
Triumph for the killers of men

[Solo: Barrett]

Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell

Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell

// Rabid //

Like a virus of the mind
My rage will spread
My obsession with murder
Roils in my head

Killing victims with my hands
I cannot control
These extreme compulsions
Burn in my soul

Foaming at the mouth I leap
Onto my prey
Target of my violence
Will die today

Feel the victim's cracking bones
He screams in pain
Only slaughter brings me peace
I have gone insane

Rabid

Inflammation of the brain
Fury overwhelms
There is something wrong with me
I am not well

Victim's head
Thumbs in his eyes
Blood is squirting from the sockets
Pours down the sides

Smash his teeth with my fist
Tear off his nose
Laughing at his shattered face
Rage only grows
With my fingers gouge his throat
Rip slabs of flesh
I continue the assault
But he is clearly dead

Rabid

Can't restrain my need to kill them drives me mad
I'm insane I want to spill blood with my hands

Schizophrenic mania
Paranoid anxiety
Violent ferocity
Criminal insanity

I am obsessed with butchery I am mad
A trail of corpses so much blood on my hands

[Solo: O'Brien]

Rabid

// Torn Through //

Violently torn through the back of the head as debris from
the skull hits the ground
Writhing and twitching from brains being splattered I'll never get used to that sound
Gaze at the fear in eyes horrified terrified just as a life will expire
Blood drips away from an utter disgrace in hell I will kill you again

Torn through with vengeance o blame
Torn through for wanting you dead

Anger summoned evil deep inside my rotting soul
Remnants of a morbid past implies my mind is out of control
Putrid vision seen before but only seen by me
Screaming voices whisper murder
Pent up wrath is fed with killing sprees

Prolonged brutal rampage slaughter with no end in sight
Remnants of a morbid past implies my mind is out of control

Unforgiving pain is what another death sets free
Sacrifice of sanity accelerates my lack of control

Putrid vision seen before but only seen by me
Screaming voices whisper murder
Pent up wrath is fed with killing sprees

Killing sprees
Killing sprees
Killing sprees
Killing sprees

[Solo: O'Brien]

Violently torn through the back of the head as debris from

Writhing and twitching from brains being splattered

Torn through with vengeance to blame
Torn through for wanting you dead
