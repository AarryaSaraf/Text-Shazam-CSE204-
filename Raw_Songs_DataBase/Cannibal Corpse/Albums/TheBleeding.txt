// Staring Through The Eyes Of The Dead //

Why can't I breathe
Still I see
Dead on the table
Try to move, I'm not able to

They said I have died
I still felt alive
I won't believe their lies
I can still see through these
Eyes

Help me I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell
Tell me I'm alive
Dead

Knives cutting into me
Scalpels rip me
Screaming into deaf ears
Now they stop and see my
tears

Help me I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell
Tell me I'm alive
Dead

I can't stop the visions
Stop the premonitions

My soul can't escape
The boundary of my flesh
My heart does not beat
My spirit does not rest

They said I have died
I still felt alive
I won't believe their lies
I can still see through these
Eyes

// Fucked With A Knife //

No escape from your fate
Destined to be mine
Every night I wait to see
In the night, watching
Stalking your every move
I know when you're alone
All alone

Tied tight to the bed
Legs spread open
Bruised flesh, lacerations
Skin stained with blood
I'm the only one you love
I feel her heart beating
my knife deep inside
Her crotch is bleeding

She liked the way it felt inside her
Fucking her, harder, harder

She liked the way it felt inside her
Fucking her, harder, harder

Stick it in
Rip the skin
Carve and twist
Torn flesh
From behind
I cut her crotch
In her ass I stuck my cock
Killing as I cum

// Stripped, Raped And Strangled //

They think they know who I am
All they know is I love to kill
Face down, dead on the ground
Find me before another is found

I come alive in the darkness
Left murdered and nameless
Dead unburied and rotten
Half eaten by insects

She was so beautiful
I had to kill her

Tied her up
And taped her mouth shut
Couldn't scream
Raped violently
Rope tight, around her throat
Her body twitches
As she chokes

Strangulation caused her death
Just like all the others
Raped before and after death
Stripped, naked, tortured

They're all dead, they're all dead
They're all dead, by strangulation

I come alive in the darkness
Left murdered and nameless
Dead unburied and rotten
Half eaten by insects

It felt so good to kill

I took their lives away
7 dead, lying rotten
Unburied victims
their naked bodies putrefy

Strangulation caused her death
Just like all the others
Raped before and after death
Stripped, naked, tortured

They're all dead, they're all dead
They're all dead, by strangulation

I come alive in the darkness
Left murdered and nameless
Dead unburied and rotten
Half eaten by insects

They think they know who I am
All they know is I love to kill
Face down, dead on the ground
Find me before another is found

// Pulverized //

Temptation to kill again
The sensation comes over me
An addiction to murdering
I can't stop killing

You tried to stop me
Dead, before you started
Put me away
Before I put another
In the grave

Pulverized
Knocked down it came up behind me
In the dark
Overwhelmed, I feel life slip from me
This isn't happening, pulverized
I won't sustain these injuries
Pick up the pieces of me

Temptation to kill again
The sensation comes over me
An addiction to murdering
I can't stop killing

You tried to stop me
Dead, before you started
Put me away
Before I put another
In the grave

Pulverized
Knocked down it came up behind me
In the dark
Overwhelmed, I feel life slip from me
This isn't happening, pulverized
I won't sustain these injuries
Pick up the pieces of me

Temptation to kill again
The sensation comes over me
An addiction to murdering
I can't stop killing

You tried to stop me
Dead, before you started
Put me away
Before I put another
In the grave

Pulverized
Knocked down it came up behind me
In the dark
Overwhelmed, I feel life slip from me
This isn't happening, pulverized
I won't sustain these injuries
Pick up the pieces of me

An addiction to murdering
I can't stop

// Return To Flesh //

Bleeding wounds never clot
Even after death
Murdered dead look on from beyond
Never to return

No way back at all
Trapped
Between life and death
We can't return to flesh

I'm dead now
Life has passed
In the grave
No life left
Move on to
The other side
Rotten
I have died

Murder took my life away
I will never rest
Dead, reaching from the grave
So cold in this place

[Solo - Jack]

I'm dead now
Life has passed
In the grave
No life left
Move on to
The other side
Rotten
I have died

Murder took my life away
I will never rest
Dead, reaching from the grave
So cold in this place

No way back at all
Trapped
Between life and death
I will come back

// The Pick-Axe Murders //

[Solo - Jack]

You thought it was over, it's not over
I came back, I brought my axe

In the shadows, alone in the dark
Young victims I stalk

You thought it was over, it's not over
I came back

From the grave
To mutilate

Axed in the back
Pick through the neck
Dead like the rest

Molested and left
Limbs split in half
I ruptured their flesh
Puncture wounds
To the head

Bone fragments clot to the hatchet
Knee-deep in the blood of the dead
Cranial separation
Sex with her severed head

Rotten walking dead
Hunting living victims

// She Was Asking For It //

[Solo - Rob]

Take me back
Back to the scene
It's coming back
I remember her screams
The fear in her eye
The night she died
It left me empty
Hollow inside

Dead to the world, I see only black, there's blood on my hands
Dead to the world, I see only black, the blood of the dead

Feelings deep inside
I don't understand
Can't fall asleep at night
I try and wake in fright
Touch of her skin
Next to mine
Warm and wet
Deep inside

Dead to the world, I see only black, there's blood on my hands
Dead to the world, I see only black, the blood of the dead

I wrapped my hands around her neck
Squeezing out her breath
Eyes rolled back in her head
Crawling at my skin
I know now it's not my fault
She was asking for it

Memories
Came back to me
In the night
I hear her screams
Waiting
In the grave
Calling out

Come to me
I hear her screaming
Waiting - in the grave
Calling out, but she's buried
Waiting - in the grave
Come to me
I hear her screaming
Waiting

I wrapped my hands around her neck
Squeezing out her breath
Eyes rolled back in her head
Crawling at my skin
I know now it's not my fault
She was asking for it

Memories
Came back to me
In the night
I hear her screams
Waiting
In the grave
Calling out

I remember her screams
The night she died
I left her empty
Hollow inside

Dead to the world, I see only black, there's blood on my hands
Dead to the world, I see only black, the blood of the dead

// The Bleeding //

Bleeding

Slicing through the flesh
A knife stuck in your neck
Stabbing out your eyes
Cutting through the spine

Blood burning through my veins
We have risen from the grave

Live, life

Dead for years, now alive
The dead came to life

Dead creatures out for blood
After death we will awaken
Unhuman beings from beyond
Rotting zombies out for blood

Bleed, bleed

Bleeding through my pores
Clotted pus, crusts my skin
My body cold
But I live on
Bleeding

The dead awaken, living rotten
Rotten living dead

Slicing through the flesh
A knife stuck in your neck
Stabbing out your eyes
Cutting through the spine

Blood burning through my veins
We have risen from the grave

Live, life - dead

// Force Fed Broken Glass //

Flesh starts to rip
Gouging through skin
From the throat
Blood gushes
Glandular eruption
Blistered skin secretion
Internal punctures
Blood regurgitation

Gagging, choking, on broken glass

Shredded muscle tissue
Wounds too deep to heal
Severed esophagus
Tongue split in half
Lungs fill with blood
As vocal chords collapse

Oral sex
With broken glass
Ruptured flesh
Ripped through the neck
Mutilate
Pulsing veins
Sliced windpipe

Flesh starts to rip
Gouging through skin
From the throat
Blood gushes
Glandular eruption
Blistered skin secretion

Wounds too deep to heal
In me
Torn trachea
Splintered skin
Down the throat
Choke
Lungs fill with blood
As vocal chords collapse
Oral sex, with broken glass

// An Experiment In Homicide //

Walk away, into the dark
Come my way, terror
I am the evil within each soul
I take the spirits of those I kill

Murdered

Decomposition, The body rots
Rotting, rotting body parts
I killed the first
To experiment

I don't want to hurt you
I just want to kill you

Torture, I start to cut
Carving, blood slowly clots
Horrors, mutilations
Homicidal experimentation

I set the dead on fire
To decay in flame
Homicidal desire

More are marked for murder
More victims to capture

Butchered

Bodies hang dead
Drained of all their blood
Pieces sewn on backwards
Neck with no heads
Mutilated, dead

Homicidal desire
More are marked for murder
More victims to butcher
