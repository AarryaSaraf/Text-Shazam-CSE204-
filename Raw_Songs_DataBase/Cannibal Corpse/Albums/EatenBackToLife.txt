Album: EatenBackToLife

// Edible Autopsy //

Wheeled in on a cart, lying dormant not dead
Hospital of immortality, butcher their patients bloody red
Taken to a dark room, fear of impending doom
The doctor straps you down, with an evil grin
Grabs his rusty blade, ripping through flesh and vein
He tortures his patients through evil means

You can't try to fight them, first they change your brain
beyond the realm of evil, their means are insane
Mutilated beyond belief, but still kept alive
Pathologist of death gouging out your eyes

Guts and blood, bones are broken
As they eat your pancreas
Human liver, for their diner
Or maybe soup with eyes
Cause of death, still unknown
Gnawing meat, from your bones
Bone saw binding in your skull
Brains are oozing a human stump
Needles injected, through your eyes
Puiling off flesh, skinned alive

Killing for free in blood they will trust, and they must never forsake
feeding on blood that brought them abound, and they must kill tonight
Genocide, suicide, screaming cries, in hell you will die

Lying dormant not dead
Hospital of immortality, butcher their patients bloody red
Taken to a dark room, fear of impending doom
The doctor straps you down, with an evil grin
Grabs his rusty blade, ripping through flesh and vein
He tortures his patients through evil means

// Put Them To Death //

Evil people with evil minds
Slaughter their victims with ripping knives
They should be caught and put to death
Strapped to the chair, they should die there

Blood spewing from their eyes
As you hear their sinful cries
Destroy their evil minds
We should take their fucking lives
They should be caught and punished
For what they have done
Torture them slowly it would be fun
Kill them all off one by one

Let them go - no torture them slow
Fuck you - and your kind
We don't need you, or your lives
Execute by injection
Execution by electricution

Evil people with evil minds
Slaughter their victims with ripping knives
They should be caught and put to death
Strapped to the chair, they should die there

// Mangled //

Demolition of bodies, smashed and broken, piles of guts, moist and steaming
Tendons severing, brains are boiling, unburied corpses in state of decay
Rotten limbs start to ferment, torso's torn in two
Skin ripped off to expose muscle tissue, butchered for human stew
Crawl into the cadaver head first, eat your way through the guts
The purgent smell of decaying innards is enough to drive you nuts
The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your mouth
As you chew on the piss filled kidney's
Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving nothing but bones
Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of death fill the air
Bones sticking out, ripped from sockets, blood spurting everywhere
Victim lying dead, neck but no head, smearing remains on your own face
Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of death fill the air

Blistering flesh, another death, stiffened bones, morbid groans
Evil mind, brain oozing slime, feel the pain
Body weak brain contorting, fluid flowing from your organs
Veins torn our, Mangled
Festering flesh, quivering cadaver, ligaments stretched around your own neck
Drink the pus, Mangled
Severed dick, bloody bowels, the gutted corpse now lies hollow
Feeding on feces, Mangled
Amputated arms, crushing legs, head is ripped right off your shoulders
Thrown in a pile, Mangled
Limbs rearranged, head on backwards a humongous heap of twisting flesh
Sewn together, Mangled - Mangled

His knife plunges in your cold battered body
Blood seeping through, the jagged wounds he cuts
Unbearable pain, give into death
Your life slips away, perish in blood

Menacing madman mutilating
Destroying, disfiguring, dead you'll be
Crushing, cracking, killing you
Annihilation, desecration

Born through modern day science
Man has made his last mistake
A creature so hideously horrible
Leaving nothing to waste
Evil has a new face, a mangled horrible face
His views are those of death, nothing will stop his lust

Slicing victims left to decay, listening to their mortal cries
Unhuman, immortal, bestial, now he owns your soul
Crawl into the cadaver head first, eat your way through the guts
The pungent smell of decaying innards is enough to drive you nuts
The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your mouth
As you chew on the piss filled kidney's
Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving nothing but bones

Human converted to beast, the perfect killing machine
Psychotic structure of brain tissue, murder his only memory
Dependant on death, crushing your head, I'm addicted to blood
Chew the decay

[Solo - Bob]

The weakened man must die, tearing out his insides
Smashing all the bones, hear his tormenting groans

[Solo - Jack]

// Scattered Remains, Splattered Brains //

Prepare to witness a place of gore
Of legal dissection and blood on the floor
Carved up corpses, in the corner
Sliced up by a psychotic coroner
Slice, dice, chop them haphazardly
Like laboratory mice, splatter brain matter
Pound on the skull until it shatters

Hack, slice, chop, carve, rip and tear
Carving up your eyeballs, watch them sit and stare
Tear, rip, slice, carve, chop, hack
Toss them into a sack

Tags on bare feet, means a real treat, to the butcher of human meat
Slice the throat from ear to ear, gallons of blood do appear
Veins exposed, torn from bodies, the most interesting of hobbies
To get paid for such a task is more than any man could ask

Prepare to witness a place of gore
Of legal disection and blood on the floor
Carved up corpses, in the corner
Sliced up by a psychotic coroner
Slice, dice, chop them haphazardly
Like laboratory mice, splatter brain matter
Pound on the skull until it shatters

Hack, slice, chop, carve, rip and tear
Carving up your eyeballs, watch them sit and stare
Tear, rip, slice, carve, chop, hack
Toss them into a sack

Ripping, tearing your skin turning red
Vile surgeon, knife cutting in
Skull cracking, to expose your brain
Evil doctor death drove him insane

// Born In A Casket //

Enter the crypts of hell, to impregnate the dead
Fresh burial sight, my hunger grows tonight
Undying lust for cadaverous molestation
Sights of death building my sensations
Ferocious need for decomposing bodies

Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot
Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch

Raging fires of hell, burning through my soul
My love for a dead fuck, I cannot control
The child soon will rise, all evil will survive
Birth through death

The newborn needs a feast, its mother is the meal
Chomping on her flesh, his teeth tearing her skin
I love to fuck the dead, demons in my head
Tearing at my brain

Bleeding sores beginning to stench
While you lick the festering stump
Green infection discharging pus
Devour the putrid afterbirth

Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot
Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch

// Rotting Head //

A quivering pile of useless flesh, locked in a padded cell
Hidden from the prying eyes of curiosity
Experimental surgery made him what he is today
His head is rotting but his body lives on as a worthless vegetable
Unknown to mankind, the incredible power of his mind

Hideous heredity, genetic imbalance, resorting to cannibalism
A feast begins as the patient's skull is cracked open like a walnut
Brains devoured in a frenzied slaughter, thrist for gore nothing more
Bile is dripping, pus from wounds, as the coroner drinks it down

The sights before your eyes you can't describe
A trip through this living hell will rot away your skull

Genital lacerating, anal asyphyxiation
Blockade of bowel passage, def√•cation, hemmorage
Cadaverous mutilation, metamorphial radiation
Devourance of arteries, decapitated extremeties
Cranial excavation, cerebral liquidation
Brain turned to soup, ears are dripping goop

Slimy, cozing, dripping pus, torn out fingernails starting to fuse
Shredded cartilage victim lies, eye sockets, but no eyes
Miles of intestines strewn all about, facial features strickened with gout
Hanging bodies dripping with blood, the blackened fluid sinks in the mud

[Solo: Bob]
[Solo: Jack]

A quivering pile of useless flesh, locked in a padded cell

// Bloody Chunks //

Walking down the street, the smell of death in the air
What a rotting stench
My imagination runs wild at what this could be
Open up the can to discover a dead body

Or what was left of one, pieces in a bag
Blood is everywhere what a retched sight
Cut up really small by a razor sharp knife
Lying in the garbage no one else knows
What I have found, what should I do
Take it to the police or make it into stew
This was an evil committed by the insane
Looking down laughing, I am the same

The sight of death drives me nuts, I must kill, to control my brain
Swept away by my lust to cause pain, mutilation is my only want
The evil inside me gives me the strength to kill at will
My life is the means to cause death in the most sinister ways

I see it in your eyes the fear that keeps me alive
I'll take it away, your life will end today
I'll leave you to rot, what a sick odor
Scream all you want, but you can't stop this horror

Tasting your life as I drink your blood
Ripping out your insides, chewing on your spleen
Dead or living flesh is what I crave
I'll kill someone or eat from a grave

// A Skull Full Of Maggots //

Lying there cold after a torturous death
Your life ended fast you took your last breath
Dead in a grave, your final place
The maggots infest your disfigured face
Pus through your veins takes the place of blood
Decay sets in, bones begin to crack
Thrown six feet down left to rot
Brains oozing black down the side of your broken neck

Skull full of maggots

They enter your tomb - maggots - beginning to feast - maggots
Crawling on you - maggots - now they eat you - maggots
Rotting maggots - maggots - infesting your corpse - maggots
Parasites of the dead - maggots - now dwell in your head

Lying there cold after a torturous death
Your life ended fast you took your last breath
Dead in a grave, your final place
The maggots infest your disfigured face
Pus through your veins takes the place of blood
Decay sets in, bones begin to crack
Thrown six feet down left to rot
Brains oozing black down the side of your broken neck

// Buried In The Backyard //

To kill, is why I live
My God, gives eternal life
Slice you, I watch your blood flow
Rotten brains, I feed 'till I'm full
Pressure building, the body starts to swell

The souls of my victims brings me great power
Feasting on flesh by the hour
Lungs explode as I cave in your chest
Probing through your organs - searching for meat
Chewing the heart of my kill builds by evil will
Bodies emptied of blood to fill my sacrificial chalice
I stalk my prey at night, I need to kill tonight
To strengthen my evil soul, those that I kill worship me below
I am your worst reality, pain and torture of humanity
Violent ways of insanity, there is no end to this cruelty

In my grasp, I'll kill you fast, I'll send your soul to hell
Butchery of Human beings is the only life I know
My armies of zombies will inherit the earth, and answer to my spells
Mutilated the human race in search for immortals

I drag the carcass home, it feels stiff and cold
Incantation of the devil to rob it of its soul
Consume the lifeless cadaver, I drink your blackened blood
Its death flows through my body, indulge in its pain

Crucifixion in the cemetery, awakes the dead from their sleep
Rising from their graves, to devour the weakened mortals
Under my control, I own their tortured souls
