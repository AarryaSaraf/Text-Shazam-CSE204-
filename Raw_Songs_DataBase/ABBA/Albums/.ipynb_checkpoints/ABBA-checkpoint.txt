// Mamma Mia //

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye bye, leave me now or never
mamma mia, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

// Hey Hey Helen //

So at last you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
And the price you paid
To become a woman of today
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy

Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
(Yes you can)

So you're free at last
And beginning to forget the past
Does it make you sad
When you think about the life you ha-ha-had
But you're right, you had to take a second chance
So you fight to find your freedom

Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)
What's the matter with you
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)
Don't you know what to do
(Yes you do)
(Ahah, yes you do yes you do)
(Ahah, yes you do yes you do)

Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)
What's the matter with you
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)
Don't you know what to do
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)

// Tropical Loveland //

Come to my loveland, wander along
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs
Come to the sunshine, beaches and sand
Here's the two bluebirds, won't you come to my land

The grass is mellow and the sky is blue
My paradise is waiting here for you

Oooh, it's a tropical loveland
Oooh, I wanna share it with you
Life can be funny
Happy and sunny
Oooh, in my tropical loveland

Come to my loveland, wander with me
Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree
Over the rainbow, under the moon
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon?

Just take my hand, I'll show you everything
The secrets that my paradise can bring

Oooh, it's a tropical loveland
Oooh, I wanna share it with you
Life can be funny
Happy and sunny
Oooh, in my tropical loveland

Oooh, it's a tropical loveland
Oooh, I wanna share it with you
(I wanna share it with you)
Oooh, it's a tropical loveland
(It's a tropical loveland)
Oooh, I wanna share it with you
Oooh, it's a tropical loveland
Oooh, I wanna share it with you

// S. O. S. //

Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S. O. S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S. O. S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?

You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S. O. S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S. O. S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S. O. S.
And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S. O. S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?

// Man In The Middle //

Did you see that man in the limousine
With the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill

Did you see that man with a fat cigar
He just left his lovers with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
Where the rest of the street can peer

'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle...)

But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy the lot, his friend

'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle...)

// Bang-A-Boomerang //

Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much
Sweet sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender

Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
So give it away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love
A boom-a-boomerang is love

Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is a boomerang you're throwing

Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
So give it away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love

And if you're warm and tender
I'll kiss you, return to sender
Please surrender

Bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love
A boom-a-boomerang is love

// I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do //

Love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? 
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I just made it, I found you at last

So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cos it's true
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it, but just wait and see

So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cos it's true
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
So love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? 
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

// I've Been Waiting For You //

I, I've been in love before
I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
Still, strange as it seems to me
You brought it back to me
That old feeling

I, I don't know what you do
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me

You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you

I, I'm gonna make you mine
You're gonna feel so fine
You'll never want to leave me
I feel you belong to me
Someday you will agree
Please, believe me

You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
Oh, I've been waiting for you

Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na-naa

// So Long //

You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car.
Ah-ha-ha-ah
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far.
Ah-ha-ha-ah
They say that money's got a magic touch,
But not to me; it doesn't mean that much.
You won't have me tonight.
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!

So long. See ya, honey.
Can't buy me with your money.
Tracy and Daisy, they may be crazy,
But I'll never be your girl.
So long. See ya, honey.
Can't buy me with your money.
You know it's not worth trying.
So long. So long. So long!

You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today.
Ah-ha-ha-ah
I wouldn't keep a thing from you; I gave them all away.
Ah-ha-ha-ah
The girls might fall for everything you've got,
But I'm not one of them. You know I'm not.
You won't have me tonight.
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!

So long. See ya, honey.
Can't buy me with your money.
Tracy and Daisy, they may be crazy,
But I'll never be your girl.
So long. See ya, honey.
Can't buy me with your money.
You know it's not worth trying.
So long. So long. So long!

So long. See ya, honey.
Can't buy me with your money.
You know it's not worth trying.
So long. So long. So long!
So long. So long. So long!
So long. So long. So long!

// Crazy World //

I was out for the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house 'cos I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realise
It's a crazy world

As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realise
It's a crazy world

Baby how could you do it
You just told me lies
Had you been behind my back with other guys?
Baby how could you tell me
There was only me
I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see

Then you smiled and you took my hand
"There is something," you said "that you may not know.
There's a couple of men in my life,
And one of them is my brother Joe.
He's been gone for a long long time
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay.
You'll be seeing a lot of him
He's so nice in every way."

And I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
And I realise
It's a crazy world
So I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
Then I realise
It's a crazy world
