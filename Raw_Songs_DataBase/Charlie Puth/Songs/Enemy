If, I'm gonna fall
Will you promise me I'll always have a kingdom?
'Cause I, I have it all
But you're taking everything I ever dreamed of

Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
For putting me through this hell
Saying
Oh, woah
I'm feeling the doubt
A feeling I knew too well

If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy

If, I had a choice
I suppose I'd have to do it all over
'Cause when, I hear your voice
Part of me just wants to be a little closer

Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
For putting me through this hell
Saying
Oh, woah
I'm feeling the doubt
A feeling I knew too well

If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy

Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
You're not who you said you were
Oh, woah woah
I'm feeling the doubt
Your face is just one big blur

If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy

If I don't
Breathe a little
If I don't
Breathe a little
