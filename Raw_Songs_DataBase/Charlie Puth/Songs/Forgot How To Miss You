I saw your roommate on my way home
I guess your new place, it must be close
Somehow I see you everywhere I go
That used to fuck me up
I guess I heard enough

Had to love you, hate you, let you go
Had to learn to be alone
Used to feel so much, but now I don't

I finally forgot how to miss you, miss you, yeah
Seeing you happy don't make me, make me sad
It took a minute to get out of the dark
Out of my head, out of my heart
But I (Finally forgot how to)
Finally forgot how to (Finally forgot how to)
I finally forgot how to miss you

I seen those pictures of your new friends
I used to wonder what you told them
If you talked about us (About us)
If you're still in love (In love)
That used to fuck me up
I guess I heard enough

Had to love you, hate you, let you go
Had to learn to be alone
Used to feel so much, but now I don't

I finally forgot how to miss you, miss you, yeah
Seeing you happy don't make me, make me sad
It took a minute to get out of the dark
Out of my head, out of my heart
But I (Finally forgot how to)
Finally forgot how to (Finally forgot how to)
I finally forgot how to

Wish that you were mine (You were mine)
I've lost you but I'm not losing sleep at night (Sleep at night)
It took a minute to get out of the dark
Out of my head, out of my heart
But I (Finally forgot how to)
Finally forgot how to (Finally forgot how to)
I finally forgot how to miss you

Oh, I finally forgot how to miss you
Let you go, let you go
Used to hurt but now I don't

I finally forgot how to miss you, miss you, yeah
Seeing you happy don't make me, make me sad
