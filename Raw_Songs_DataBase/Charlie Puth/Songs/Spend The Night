Monday you hate to drive home
With a million red lights on the strip
That night I come to your door
You're the one I've so desperately missed

Do you remember always staying home with me and watching friends
Well I'd do anything for that again

Come spend the night here with me up in Boston
Don't leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you'll feel the same way tomorrow
If you see me calling your phone

In my fantasy, I see you next to me
Every night, every day
This empty room feels so strange
Wanna stay, here with you
Go all the way, this afternoon
You caught me with nothing to say
(Caught me with nothing to say)

Do you remember when I'd always lie with you 'til 3 a.m.
I'd give anything for that again

Come spend the night here with me up in Boston
Don't leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you'll feel the same way tomorrow
If you see me calling your phone

Ooh, baby

Come spend the night here with me up in Boston
Don't leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you'll feel the same way tomorrow
If you see me calling your phone
When you'll see me calling your phone, your phone
When you see me calling your phone
