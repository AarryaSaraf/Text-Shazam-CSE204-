Aw yeah
What?
I have a little story to tell you
And it goes like this

I was walking down the street, bitch, walking down the street
Walking down the street with shoes at my feet
But then I saw a glimpse from the corner of my eye
I saw this smokin' hot broad walk by
I said, "Yo baby, what's up?", she said "you talkin' to me?"
"Well, duh, there's no one else on the street"
"You're coming back to my place" this how it's gonna be
But then something hit my face

Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Can't you see I'm tryna mack this bitch?
Who threw this pickle at me?

Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
I tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure
Bitch, this ***'s not even kosher

The next day, nothing's new
Sitting on this seat like I always do
Saw them other bitches walkin' my way
"Man... I need a bagel"

Eating at the deli with my bagel and jelly
While I'm observing the trees
Gosh, how did they get so green and plump?
Wait, what just hit my face? Oh my...

Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Can't you see I'm tryna eat my bagel?
Who threw this pickle at me?

Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
I tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure
Bitch, this ***'s not even kosher
