I'll take a break tonight
Feels like my mind's on fire
Only been a week but all I can think of is you you you
Trying to find a way
To see you again each day
But I'm running out of right things to say

Baby, I could touch the sky
If only you were standing right here by my side
I can wait forever
Just don't tell me "never"
'Cause baby when I look in your eyes

My heart go crazy
It's insanity
Yeah, you're making me, oh
Baby, can you hear
My heart go crazy
It's insanity
Yeah, you're making me, oh
Baby, can you hear my heart go

There's nothing to deny
You make me feel inside
You don't even know how I'm going out my mind mind mind
'Cause there's no where that
I'd rather be than when you're here right next to me
I'm trying to fight it but now I can clearly see

Baby, I could touch the sky
If only you were standing right here by my side
I can wait forever
Just don't tell me "never"
'Cause baby, when I look in your eyes

My heart go crazy
It's insanity
Yeah, you're making me, oh
Baby, can you hear
My heart go crazy
It's insanity
Yeah, you're making me, oh
Baby, can you hear my heart go
(Oh oh oh oh...)
Can you hear my heart go
(Oh oh oh oh...)
Ooh (oh oh oh oh...)
Can you hear my heart go

You do...
If you were my girl
I'll hold you so tight
I'll be with you
Everyday and every night

Baby, I could touch the sky
If only you were standing right here by my side
I can wait forever
Just don't tell me "never"
'Cause, baby, when I look in your eyes
My heart go (oh oh oh oh...)
Can you hear my heart go
(Oh oh oh oh...)
Can you hear my heart?
