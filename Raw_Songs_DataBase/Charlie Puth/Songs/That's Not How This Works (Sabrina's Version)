Thought the day you disappeared that it was over
Didn't even hear you leavin'
Saw you with someone and thought that it was closure
But you still tell me that you need me

Baby, why, tell me, why
Can't you just make up your mind?
Quit messin' with my head

You can't say you hate me
Then call me when you're hurt
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works
You can't walk away
Then come back to what we were
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works, no

No, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no
Baby, that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works, oh

Stop remindin' me of when we said "forever"
I know exactly what you're doin'
Oh, when you say you need to drop off all my sweaters
It's just one of your excuses

Baby, why, tell me, why
Can't you just make up your mind?
Quit messin' with my head

You can't say you hate me
Then call me when you're hurt
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works
You can't walk away
Then come back to what we were
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no (That's not how this works)
That's not how this works, no (Not how this works)

Don't say that you're in love with me (Say that you're in love)
'Cause I know it's not what you mean

You can't say you hate me
Then call me when you're hurt
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works (Works, baby, no)
You can't walk away
Then come back to what we were
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works, no (Oh, woah)

No, no, no, no (Hey)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Baby, that's not how this works, no (This works)
That's not how this works, oh (This works)

No, no, no, no (Ooh, oh, oh)
Oh, no, no, no, no
Baby, that's not how this works
