I took her out to dinner
I thought I'd had a winner
And what happened next came to a surprise to be
So I walked her to her front door
Waiting for what I had hoped for
But then she hugged and said goodnight to me
As I took my bad, stepped off that porch, I saw a friend of mine
She stepped closer then grabbed my hand and met me eye to eye

That's when she kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her
And I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go
Whoa...

So I took her down to the shoreline
The weather that day was so fine
And not to mention she looked pretty good too
And later at the movies, romantic comedy
I hate those films but for her I managed to get through
I walked her to her front porch as we said our goodbyes
As I desperately tried to say something
She put her finger on my lip and said one more thing

She kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her
And I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know, that I will never let her go
Whoa...

It's nice to know that she cares enough about me
I never saw saw this coming, and my heart's constantly drumming
And whenever she's around I'll never ever feel the same
About that other girl's name

Because she kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her
And I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go
Whoa...
