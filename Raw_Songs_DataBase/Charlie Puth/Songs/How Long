Alright

I'll admit, I was wrong
What else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved

She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?" Yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

How long has this been going on?
You've been creeping 'round on me
While you're calling me "baby"
How long has this been going on?
You've been acting so shady
I've been feeling it lately, baby

I'll admit, it's my fault
But you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once
I try and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, ooh, yeah

She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?"
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

How long has this been going on?
You've been creeping 'round on me
While you're calling me "baby"
How long has this been going on?
You've been acting so shady
I've been feeling it lately, baby

How long has it been going on, baby?
You gotta go tell me now

She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?" Yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

How long has this been going on?

You've been creeping 'round on me
While you're calling me "baby"
How long has this been going on?
You've been acting so shady
I've been feeling it lately, baby
How long has this been going on?
You've been creeping 'round on me
(How long has it been going on, baby?)
How long has this been going on?
(You gotta go tell me now)
You've been acting so shady
I've been feeling it lately, baby
